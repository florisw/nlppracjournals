PMID- 22610493   - ObjectiveA method for the automatic resolution of coreference between medical      concepts in clinical records Materials and methodsA multiple pass sieve approach       utilizing support vector machines  SVMs  at each pass was used to resolve      coreference  Information such as lexical similarity, recency of a concept      mention, synonymy based on Wikipedia redirects, and local lexical context were      used to inform the method  Results were evaluated using an unweighted average of       MUC, CEAF, and B 3  coreference evaluation metrics  The datasets used in these      research experiments were made available through the 2011 i2b2/VA Shared Task on       Coreference ResultsThe method achieved an average F score of 0 821 on the ODIE      dataset, with a precision of 0 802 and a recall of 0 845  These results compare      favorably to the best-performing system with a reported F score of 0 827 on the      dataset and the median system F score of 0 800 among the eight teams that      participated in the 2011 i2b2/VA Shared Task on Coreference  On the i2b2 dataset,      the method achieved an average F score of 0 906, with a precision of 0 895 and a       recall of 0 918 compared to the best F score of 0 915 and the median of 0 859      among the 16 participating teams DiscussionPost hoc analysis revealed significant      performance degradation on pathology reports  The pathology reports were      characterized by complex synonymy and very few patient mentions ConclusionThe use      of several simple lexical matching methods had the most impact on achieving      competitive performance on the task of coreference resolution  Moreover, the      ability to detect patients in electronic medical records helped to improve      coreference resolution more than other linguistic analysis

PMID- 22596079   - Many public health agencies monitor population health using syndromic      surveillance, generally employing information from emergency department  ED       visit records  When combined with other information, objective evidence of fever       may enhance the accuracy with which surveillance systems detect syndromes of      interest, such as influenza-like illness  This study found that patient chief      complaint of self-reported fever was more readily available in ED records than      measured temperature and that the majority of patients with an elevated      temperature recorded also self-reported fever  Due to its currently limited      availability, we conclude that measured temperature is likely to add little value      to self-reported fever in syndromic surveillance for febrile illness using ED      records

PMID- 22582205   - ObjectiveCoreference resolution of concepts, although a very active area in the      natural language processing community, has not yet been widely applied to      clinical documents  Accordingly, the 2011 i2b2 competition focusing on this area       is a timely and useful challenge  The objective of this research was to collate      coreferent chains of concepts from a corpus of clinical documents  These concepts      are in the categories of person, problems, treatments, and tests DesignA machine       learning approach based on graphical models was employed to cluster coreferent      concepts  Features selected were divided into domain independent and domain      specific sets  Training was done with the i2b2 provided training set of 489      documents with 6949 chains  Testing was done on 322 documents ResultsThe learning      engine, using the un-weighted average of three different measurement schemes,      resulted in an F measure of 0 8423 where no domain specific features were      included and 0 8483 where the feature set included both domain independent and      domain specific features ConclusionOur machine learning approach is a promising      solution for recognizing coreferent concepts, which in turn is useful for     practical applications such as the assembly of problem and medication lists from       clinical documents

PMID- 22556185   - ObjectivePatient discharge summaries provide detailed medical information about      hospitalized patients and are a rich resource of data for clinical record text      mining  The textual expressions of this information are highly variable  In order     to acquire a precise understanding of the patient, it is important to uncover the      relationship between all instances in the text  In natural language processing       NLP , this task falls under the category of coreference resolution DesignA key      contribution of this paper is the application of contextual-dependent rules that       describe relationships between coreference pairs  To resolve phrases that refer     to the same entity, the authors use these rules in three representative NLP      systems: one rule-based, another based on the maximum entropy model, and the last      a system built on the Markov logic network  MLN  model ResultsThe experimental      results show that the proposed MLN-based system outperforms the baseline system       exact match  by average F-scores of 4 3% and 5 7% on the Beth and Partners      datasets, respectively  Finally, the three systems were integrated into an      ensemble system, further improving performance to 87 21%, which is 4 5% more than      the official i2b2 Track 1C average  82 7%  ConclusionIn this paper, the main      challenges in the resolution of coreference relations in patient discharge      summaries are described  Several rules are proposed to exploit contextual      information, and three approaches presented  While single systems provided      promising results, an ensemble approach combining the three systems produced a      better performance than even the best single system

PMID- 22542813   - Clinical research is the foundation for advancing the practice of medicine       However, the lack of seamless integration between clinical research and patient      care workflow impedes recruitment efficiency, escalates research costs, and hence      threatens the entire clinical research enterprise  Increased use of electronic      health records  EHRs  holds promise for facilitating this integration but must      surmount regulatory obstacles  Among the unintended consequences of current      research oversight are barriers to accessing patient information for prescreening      and recruitment, coordinating scheduling of clinical and research visits, and      reconciling information about clinical and research drugs  We conclude that the      EHR alone cannot overcome barriers in conducting clinical trials and comparative       effectiveness research  Patient privacy and human subject protection policies      should be clarified at the local level to exploit optimally the full potential of      EHRs, while continuing to ensure participant safety  Increased alignment of      policies that regulate the clinical and research use of EHRs could help fulfill      the vision of more efficiently obtaining clinical research evidence to improve      human health

PMID- 22542812   - ObjectiveTo develop a computerized clinical decision support system  CDSS  for     cervical cancer screening that can interpret free-text Papanicolaou  Pap       reports Materials and MethodsThe CDSS was constituted by two rulebases: the      free-text rulebase for interpreting Pap reports and a guideline rulebase  The      free-text rulebase was developed by analyzing a corpus of 49 293 Pap reports  The      guideline rulebase was constructed using national cervical cancer screening      guidelines  The CDSS accesses the electronic medical record  EMR  system to      generate patient-specific recommendations  For evaluation, the screening      recommendations made by the CDSS for 74 patients were reviewed by a      physician Results and DiscussionEvaluation revealed that the CDSS outputs the      optimal screening recommendations for 73 out of 74 test patients and it      identified two cases for gynecology referral that were missed by the physician       The CDSS aided the physician to amend recommendations in six cases  The failure      case was because human papillomavirus  HPV  testing was sometimes performed      separately from the Pap test and these results were reported by a laboratory      system that was not queried by the CDSS  Subsequently, the CDSS was upgraded to      look up the HPV results missed earlier and it generated the optimal      recommendations for all 74 test cases LimitationsSingle institution and single      expert study ConclusionAn accurate CDSS system could be constructed for cervical       cancer screening given the standardized reporting of Pap tests and the      availability of explicit guidelines  Overall, the study demonstrates that free      text in the EMR can be effectively utilized through natural language processing      to develop clinical decision support tools

PMID- 22539082   - ObjectivePharmacogenomics evaluations of variability in drug metabolic processes       may be useful for making individual drug response predictions  We present an      approach to deriving 'phenotype scores' based on existing pharmacogenomics      knowledge and a patient's genomics data  Pharmacogenomics plays an important role      in the bioactivation of tamoxifen, a prodrug administered to patients for breast       cancer treatment  Tamoxifen is therefore considered a model for many drugs      requiring bioactivation  We investigate whether this knowledge-based approach can      be applied to produce a phenotype score that is predictive of the      endoxifen/N-desmethyltamoxifen  NDM  plasma concentration ratio in patients      taking tamoxifen Materials and methodsWe implement a knowledge-based model for     calculating phenotype scores from patient-specific genotype data  These data      include allelic variants of genes encoding enzymes involved in the bioactivation       of tamoxifen  We performed quantile linear regression to evaluate whether six      phenotype scoring algorithms are predictive of patient endoxifen/NDM plasma      concentration ratio, and validate our scoring methods ResultsOur model      illustrates a knowledge-based approach to predict drug metabolism efficacy given       patient genomics data  Results showed that for one phenotype scoring algorithm,      scores were weakly correlated with patient endoxifen/NDM plasma concentration      ratios  This algorithm performed better than simple metrics for variation in      individual and multiple genes DiscussionWe discuss advantages of the model,      challenges to its implementation in a personalized medicine context, and provide       example future directions ConclusionsWe demonstrate the utility of our model in a      tamoxifen case study context  We also provide evidence that more complicated      polygenic models are needed to represent heterogeneity in clinical outcomes

PMID- 22539080   - ObjectiveThis paper describes a natural language processing system for the task      of pneumonia identification  Based on the information extracted from the      narrative reports associated with a patient, the task is to identify whether or     not the patient is positive for pneumonia DesignA binary classifier was employed       to identify pneumonia from a dataset of multiple types of clinical notes created       for 426 patients during their stay in the intensive care unit  For this purpose,       three types of features were considered:  1  word n-grams,  2  Unified Medical      Language System  UMLS  concepts, and  3  assertion values associated with      pneumonia expressions  System performance was greatly increased by a feature      selection approach which uses statistical significance testing to rank features      based on their association with the two categories of pneumonia      identification ResultsBesides testing our system on the entire cohort of 426      patients  unrestricted dataset , we also used a smaller subset of 236 patients       restricted dataset   The performance of the system was compared with the results      of a baseline previously proposed for these two datasets  The best results      achieved by the system  85 71 and 81 67 F1-measure  are significantly better than      the baseline results  50 70 and 49 10 F1-measure  on the restricted and      unrestricted datasets, respectively ConclusionUsing a statistical feature      selection approach that allows the feature extractor to consider only the most      informative features from the feature space significantly improves the      performance over a baseline that uses all the features from the same feature      space  Extracting the assertion value for pneumonia expressions further improves       the system performance

PMID- 22534081   - ObjectiveInadequate participant recruitment is a major problem facing clinical      research  Recent studies have demonstrated that electronic health record       EHR -based, point-of-care, clinical trial alerts  CTA  can improve participant      recruitment to certain clinical research studies  Despite their promise, much      remains to be learned about the use of CTAs  Our objective was to study whether     repeated exposure to such alerts leads to declining user responsiveness and to      characterize its extent if present to better inform future CTA      deployments MethodsDuring a 36-week study period, we systematically documented      the response patterns of 178 physician users randomized to receive CTAs for an      ongoing clinical trial  Data were collected on:  1  response rates to the CTA;      and  2  referral rates per physician, per time unit  Variables of interest were      offset by the log of the total number of alerts received by that physician during      that time period, in a Poisson regression ResultsResponse rates demonstrated a      significant downward trend across time, with response rates decreasing by 2 7%      for each advancing time period, significantly different from zero  flat        p<0 0001   Even after 36 weeks, response rates remained in the 30%-40% range       Subgroup analyses revealed differences between community-based versus      university-based physicians  p=0 0489  DiscussionCTA responsiveness declined      gradually over prolonged exposure, although it remained reasonably high even      after 36 weeks of exposure  There were also notable differences between      community-based versus university-based users ConclusionsThese findings add to      the limited literature on this form of EHR-based alert fatigue and should help      inform future tailoring, deployment, and further study of CTAs

PMID- 22534080   - ObjectiveThe spread of case-control genome-wide association studies  GWASs  has      stimulated the development of new variable selection methods and predictive      models  We introduce a novel Bayesian model search algorithm, Binary Outcome      Stochastic Search  BOSS , which addresses the model selection problem when the      number of predictors far exceeds the number of binary responses Materials and      methodsOur method is based on a latent variable model that links the observed      outcomes to the underlying genetic variables  A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach      is used for model search and to evaluate the posterior probability of each      predictor ResultsBOSS is compared with three established methods  stepwise      regression, logistic lasso, and elastic net  in a simulated benchmark  Two real      case studies are also investigated: a GWAS on the genetic bases of longevity, and      the type 2 diabetes study from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium       Simulations show that BOSS achieves higher precisions than the reference methods       while preserving good recall rates  In both experimental studies, BOSS      successfully detects genetic polymorphisms previously reported to be associated      with the analyzed phenotypes DiscussionBOSS outperforms the other methods in      terms of F-measure on simulated data  In the two real studies, BOSS successfully       detects biologically relevant features, some of which are missed by univariate      analysis and the three reference techniques ConclusionThe proposed algorithm is      an advance in the methodology for model selection with a large number of      features  Our simulated and experimental results showed that BOSS proves      effective in detecting relevant markers while providing a parsimonious model

PMID- 22511018   - ObjectiveToday's clinical research institutions provide tools for researchers to       query their data warehouses for counts of patients  To protect patient privacy,      counts are perturbed before reporting; this compromises their utility for     increased privacy  The goal of this study is to extend current query answer     systems to guarantee a quantifiable level of privacy and allow users to tailor     perturbations to maximize the usefulness according to their needs MethodsA      perturbation mechanism was designed in which users are given options with respect      to scale and direction of the perturbation  The mechanism translates the true      count, user preferences, and a privacy level within administrator-specified      bounds into a probability distribution from which the perturbed count is      drawn ResultsUsers can significantly impact the scale and direction of the count       perturbation and can receive more accurate final cohort estimates  Strong and      semantically meaningful differential privacy is guaranteed, providing for a      unified privacy accounting system that can support role-based trust levels  This       study provides an open source web-enabled tool to investigate visually and      numerically the interaction between system parameters, including required privacy      level and user preference settings ConclusionsQuantifying privacy allows system      administrators to provide users with a privacy budget and to monitor its      expenditure, enabling users to control the inevitable loss of utility  While      current measures of privacy are conservative, this system can take advantage of      future advances in privacy measurement  The system provides new ways of trading      off privacy and utility that are not provided in current study design systems

PMID- 22511015   - BackgroundElectronic health records  EHR  have the potential to improve patient      care through efficient access to complete patient health information  This      potential may not be reached because many of the most important determinants of      health outcome are rarely included  Successful health promotion and disease      prevention requires patient-reported data reflecting health behaviors and      psychosocial issues  Furthermore, there is a need to harmonize this information      across different EHR systems MethodsTo fill this gap a three-phased process was      used to conceptualize, identify and recommend patient-reported data elements on      health behaviors and psychosocial factors for the EHR  Expert panels  n=13       identified candidate measures  phase 1  that were reviewed and rated by a wide      range of health professionals  n=93  using the grid-enabled measures wiki social       media platform  phase 2   Recommendations were finalized through a town hall      meeting with key stakeholders including patients, providers, researchers, policy       makers, and representatives from healthcare settings  phase 3  ResultsNine key      elements from three areas emerged as the initial critical patient-reported      elements to incorporate systematically into EHR-health behaviors  eg, exercise ,       psychosocial issues  eg, distress , and patient-centered factors  eg,      demographics   Recommendations were also made regarding the frequency of      collection ranging from a single assessment  eg, demographic characteristics , to      annual assessment  eg, health behaviors , or more frequent  eg, patient      goals  ConclusionsThere was strong stakeholder support for this initiative      reflecting the perceived value of incorporating patient-reported elements into      EHR  The next steps will include testing the feasibility of incorporating these      elements into the EHR across diverse primary care settings

PMID- 22511014   - ObjectiveThe classification of complex or rare patterns in clinical and genomic      data requires the availability of a large, labeled patient set  While methods      that operate on large, centralized data sources have been extensively used,      little attention has been paid to understanding whether models such as binary      logistic regression  LR  can be developed in a distributed manner, allowing      researchers to share models without necessarily sharing patient data Material and      methodsInstead of bringing data to a central repository for computation, we bring      computation to the data  The Grid Binary LOgistic REgression  GLORE  model      integrates decomposable partial elements or non-privacy sensitive prediction      values to obtain model coefficients, the variance-covariance matrix, the      goodness-of-fit test statistic, and the area under the receiver operating      characteristic  ROC  curve ResultsWe conducted experiments on both simulated and       clinically relevant data, and compared the computational costs of GLORE with      those of a traditional LR model estimated using the combined data  We showed that      our results are the same as those of LR to a 10 -15  precision  In addition,      GLORE is computationally efficient LimitationIn GLORE, the calculation of      coefficient gradients must be synchronized at different sites, which involves      some effort to ensure the integrity of communication  Ensuring that the      predictors have the same format and meaning across the data sets is      necessary ConclusionThe results suggest that GLORE performs as well as LR and      allows data to remain protected at their original sites

PMID- 22494789   - BackgroundProfiling the allocation and trend of research activity is of interest       to funding agencies, administrators, and researchers  However, the lack of a      common classification system hinders the comprehensive and systematic profiling      of research activities  This study introduces ontology-based annotation as a      method to overcome this difficulty  Analyzing over a decade of funding data and      publication data, the trends of disease research are profiled across topics,      across institutions, and over time ResultsThis study introduces and explores the       notions of research sponsorship and allocation and shows that leaders of research      activity can be identified within specific disease areas of interest, such as      those with high mortality or high sponsorship  The funding profiles of disease      topics readily cluster themselves in agreement with the ontology hierarchy and      closely mirror the funding agency priorities  Finally, four temporal trends are      identified among research topics ConclusionsThis work utilizes disease ontology       DO -based annotation to profile effectively the landscape of biomedical research      activity  By using DO in this manner a use-case driven mechanism is also proposed      to evaluate the utility of classification hierarchies

PMID- 22493050   - ObjectiveTo characterise empirical instances of Unified Medical Language System       UMLS  Metathesaurus term strings in a large clinical corpus, and to illustrate      what types of term characteristics are generalisable across data      sources DesignBased on the occurrences of UMLS terms in a 51 million document      corpus of Mayo Clinic clinical notes, this study computes statistics about the      terms' string attributes, source terminologies, semantic types and syntactic      categories  Term occurrences in 2010 i2b2/VA text were also mapped; eight example      filters were designed from the Mayo-based statistics and applied to i2b2/VA      data ResultsFor the corpus analysis, negligible numbers of mapped terms in the      Mayo corpus had over six words or 55 characters  Of source terminologies in the      UMLS, the Consumer Health Vocabulary and Systematized Nomenclature of      Medicine-Clinical Terms  SNOMED-CT  had the best coverage in Mayo clinical notes       at 106 426 and 94 788 unique terms, respectively  Of 15 semantic groups in the      UMLS, seven groups accounted for 92 08% of term occurrences in Mayo data       Syntactically, over 90% of matched terms were in noun phrases  For the      cross-institutional analysis, using five example filters on i2b2/VA data reduces       the actual lexicon to 19 13% of the size of the UMLS and only sees a 2% reduction      in matched terms ConclusionThe corpus statistics presented here are instructive      for building lexicons from the UMLS  Features intrinsic to Metathesaurus terms       well formedness, length and language  generalise easily across clinical      institutions, but term frequencies should be adapted with caution  The semantic      groups of mapped terms may differ slightly from institution to institution, but      they differ greatly when moving to the biomedical literature domain

PMID- 22493049   - ObjectiveCompeting tools are available online to assess the risk of developing      certain conditions of interest, such as cardiovascular disease  While predictive       models have been developed and validated on data from cohort studies, little      attention has been paid to ensure the reliability of such predictions for     individuals, which is critical for care decisions  The goal was to develop a      patient-driven adaptive prediction technique to improve personalized risk      estimation for clinical decision support Material and methodsA data-driven      approach was proposed that utilizes individualized confidence intervals  CIs  to       select the most 'appropriate' model from a pool of candidates to assess the      individual patient's clinical condition  The method does not require access to      the training dataset  This approach was compared with other strategies: the BEST       model  the ideal model, which can only be achieved by access to data or knowledge      of which population is most similar to the individual , CROSS model, and RANDOM      model selection ResultsWhen evaluated on clinical datasets, the approach      significantly outperformed the CROSS model selection strategy in terms of      discrimination  p<1e-14  and calibration  p<0 006   The method outperformed the      RANDOM model selection strategy in terms of discrimination  p<1e-12 , but the      improvement did not achieve significance for calibration       p=0 1375  LimitationsThe CI may not always offer enough information to rank the       reliability of predictions, and this evaluation was done using aggregation  If a       particular individual is very different from those represented in a training set       of existing models, the CI may be somewhat misleading ConclusionThis approach has      the potential to offer more reliable predictions than those offered by other     heuristics for disease risk estimation of individual patients

PMID- 22437075   - ObjectiveThis paper presents a study of methods for medical literature retrieval       for case queries, in which the goal is to retrieve literature articles similar to      a given patient case  In particular, it focuses on analyzing the performance of      state-of-the-art general retrieval methods and improving them by the use of      medical thesauri and physician feedback Materials and MethodsThe Kullback-Leibler     divergence retrieval model with Dirichlet smoothing is used as the      state-of-the-art general retrieval method  Pseudorelevance feedback and term      weighing methods are proposed by leveraging MeSH and UMLS thesauri  Evaluation is      performed on a test collection recently created for the ImageCLEF medical case      retrieval challenge ResultsExperimental results show that a well-tuned      state-of-the-art general retrieval model achieves a mean average precision of      0 2754, but the performance can be improved by over 40% to 0 3980, through the      proposed methods DiscussionThe results over the ImageCLEF test collection, which       is currently the best collection available for the task, are encouraging  There      are, however, limitations due to small evaluation set size  The analysis shows      that further refinement of the methods is necessary before they can be really      useful in a clinical setting ConclusionMedical case-based literature retrieval is      a critical search application that presents a number of unique challenges  This      analysis shows that the state-of-the-art general retrieval models are reasonably       good for the task, but the performance can be significantly improved by      developing new task-specific retrieval models that incorporate medical thesauri      and physician feedback

PMID- 22437074   - ObjectiveFatal errors can occur in intensive care units  ICUs   Researchers claim      that information integration at the bedside may improve nurses' situation      awareness  SA  of patients and decrease errors  However, it is unclear which      information should be integrated and in what form  Our research uses the theory      of SA to analyze the type of tasks, and their associated information gaps  We      aimed to provide recommendations for integrated, consolidated information      displays to improve nurses' SA Materials and MethodsSystematic observations      methods were used to follow 19 ICU nurses for 38 hours in 3 clinical practice      settings  Storyboard methods and concept mapping helped to categorize the      observed tasks, the associated information needs, and the information gaps of the      most frequent tasks by SA level  Consensus and discussion of the research team      was used to propose recommendations to improve information displays at the      bedside based on information deficits ResultsNurses performed 46 different tasks       at a rate of 23 4 tasks per hour  The information needed to perform the most      common tasks was often inaccessible, difficult to see at a distance or located on      multiple monitoring devices  Current devices at the ICU bedside do not adequately      support a nurse's information-gathering activities  Medication management was the      most frequent category of tasks DiscussionInformation gaps were present at all      levels of SA and across most of the tasks  Using a theoretical model to      understand information gaps can aid in designing functional      requirements ConclusionIntegrated information that enhances nurses' Situation      Awareness may decrease errors and improve patient safety in the future

PMID- 22431555   - BackgroundFailure or delay in diagnosis is a common preventable source of error        The authors sought to determine the frequency with which high-information      clinical findings  HIFs  suggestive of a high-risk diagnosis  HRD  appear in the       medical record before HRD documentation MethodsA knowledge base from a diagnostic      decision support system was used to identify HIFs for selected HRDs: lumbar disc       disease, myocardial infarction, appendicitis, and colon, breast, lung, ovarian      and bladder carcinomas  Two physicians reviewed at least 20 patient records      retrieved from a research patient data registry for each of these eight HRDs and       for age- and gender-compatible controls  Records were searched for HIFs in visit       notes that were created before the HRD was established in the electronic record      and in general medical visit notes for controls Results25% of records reviewed       61/243  contained HIFs in notes before the HRD was established  The mean      duration between HIFs first occurring in the record and time of diagnosis ranged       from 19 days for breast cancer to 2 years for bladder cancer  In three of the      eight HRDs, HIFs were much less likely in control patients without the      HRD ConclusionsIn many records of patients with an HRD, HIFs were present before       the HRD was established  Reasons for delay include non-compliance with      recommended follow-up, unusual presentation of a disease, and system errors  eg,       lack of laboratory follow-up   The presence of HIFs in clinical records suggests       a potential role for the integration of diagnostic decision support into the      clinical workflow to provide reminder alerts to improve the diagnostic focus

PMID- 22419739   - ObjectiveNarratives of electronic medical records contain information that can be      useful for clinical practice and multi-purpose research  This information needs      to be put into a structured form before it can be used by automated systems       Coreference resolution is a step in the transformation of narratives into a      structured form MethodsThis study presents a medical coreference resolution      system  MCORES  for noun phrases in four frequently used clinical semantic      categories: persons, problems, treatments, and tests  MCORES treats coreference      resolution as a binary classification task  Given a pair of concepts from a      semantic category, it determines coreferent pairs and clusters them into chains        MCORES uses an enhanced set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features  Some      MCORES features measure the distance between various representations of the      concepts in a pair and can be asymmetric Results and ConclusionMCORES was      compared with an in-house baseline that uses only single-perspective 'token      overlap' and 'number agreement' features  MCORES was shown to outperform the      baseline; its enhanced features contribute significantly to performance  In      addition to the baseline, MCORES was compared against two available third-party,       open-domain systems, RECONCILE ACL09  and the Beautiful Anaphora Resolution      Toolkit  BART   MCORES was shown to outperform both of these systems on clinical       records

PMID- 22374935   - ObjectivesElectronic health records  EHR  can allow for the generation of large      cohorts of individuals with given diseases for clinical and genomic research  A      rate-limiting step is the development of electronic phenotype selection      algorithms to find such cohorts  This study evaluated the portability of a      published phenotype algorithm to identify rheumatoid arthritis  RA  patients from      EHR records at three institutions with different EHR systems Materials and      MethodsPhysicians reviewed charts from three institutions to identify patients      with RA  Each institution compiled attributes from various sources in the EHR,      including codified data and clinical narratives, which were searched using one of      two natural language processing  NLP  systems  The performance of the published      model was compared with locally retrained models ResultsApplying the previously      published model from Partners Healthcare to datasets from Northwestern and      Vanderbilt Universities, the area under the receiver operating characteristic      curve was found to be 92% for Northwestern and 95% for Vanderbilt, compared with       97% at Partners  Retraining the model improved the average sensitivity at a      specificity of 97% to 72% from the original 65%  Both the original logistic      regression models and locally retrained models were superior to simple billing      code count thresholds DiscussionThese results show that a previously published      algorithm for RA is portable to two external hospitals using different EHR     systems, different NLP systems, and different target NLP vocabularies  Retraining      the algorithm primarily increased the sensitivity at each      site ConclusionElectronic phenotype algorithms allow rapid identification of case      populations in multiple sites with little retraining

PMID- 22374934   - BackgroundSemantic similarity analysis facilitates automated semantic      explanations of biological and clinical data annotated by biomedical ontologies        Gene ontology  GO  has become one of the most important biomedical ontologies      with a set of controlled vocabularies, providing rich semantic annotations for     genes and molecular phenotypes for diseases  Current methods for measuring GO      semantic similarities are limited to considering only the ancestor terms while      neglecting the descendants  One can find many GO term pairs whose ancestors are      identical but whose descendants are very different and vice versa  Moreover, the       lower parts of GO trees are full of terms with more specific      semantics MethodsThis study proposed a method of measuring semantic similarities       between GO terms using the entire GO tree structure, including both the upper      ancestral  and the lower  descendant  parts  Comprehensive comparison studies      were performed with well-known information content-based and graph      structure-based semantic similarity measures with protein sequence similarities,       gene expression-profile correlations, protein-protein interactions, and      biological pathway analyses ConclusionThe proposed bidirectional measure of      semantic similarity outperformed other graph-based and information content-based       methods

PMID- 22366295   - ObjectiveIn parts of the developing world traditionally modeled healthcare      systems do not adequately meet the needs of the populace  This can be due to      imbalances in both supply and demand-there may be a lack of sufficient healthcare      and the population most at need may be unable or unwilling to take advantage of      it  Home-based care has emerged as a possible mechanism to bring healthcare to      the populace in a cost-effective, useful manner  This study describes the      development, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile device-based system to      support such services Materials and MethodsMobile phones were utilized and a      structured survey was implemented to be administered by community health workers       using Open Data Kit  This system was used to support screening efforts for a      population of two million persons in western Kenya ResultsUsers of the system      felt it was easy to use and facilitated their work  The system was also more cost      effective than pen and paper alternatives DiscussionThis implementation is one of      the largest applications of a system utilizing handheld devices for performing      clinical care during home visits in a resource-constrained environment  Because      the data were immediately available electronically, initial reports could be      performed and important trends in data could thus be detected  This allowed      adjustments to the programme to be made sooner than might have otherwise been      possible ConclusionA viable, cost-effective solution at scale has been developed       and implemented for collecting electronic data during household visits in a      resource-constrained setting

PMID- 22358039   - Advances in surveillance science have supported public health agencies in      tracking and responding to disease outbreaks  Increasingly, epidemiologists have       been tasked with interpreting multiple streams of heterogeneous data arising from      varied surveillance systems  As a result public health personnel have experienced      an overload of plots and charts as information visualization techniques have not       kept pace with the rapid expansion in data availability  This study sought to      advance the science of public health surveillance data visualization by      conceptualizing a visual paradigm that provides an 'epidemiological canvas' for     detection, monitoring, exploration and discovery of regional infectious disease      activity and developing a software prototype of an 'infectious disease weather     map'  Design objectives were elucidated and the conceptual model was developed      using cognitive task analysis with public health epidemiologists  The software      prototype was pilot tested using retrospective data from a large, regional      pediatric hospital, and gastrointestinal and respiratory disease outbreaks were      re-created as a proof of concept

PMID- 22323392   - ObjectiveTo assess evidence of the impact of Picture Archiving and Communication       Systems  PACS  on clinicians' work practices in the intensive care unit       ICU  MethodsWe searched Medline, Pre-Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and the SPIE      Digital Library databases for English-language publications between 1980 and      September 2010 using Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords ResultsEleven      studies from the USA and UK were included  All studies measured aspects of time      associated with the introduction of PACS, namely the availability of images, the       time a physician took to review an image, and changes in viewing patterns  Seven       studies examined the impact on clinical decision-making, with the majority      measuring the time to image-based clinical action  The effect of PACS on      communication modes was reported in five studies DiscussionPACS can impact on      clinician work practices in three main areas  Most of the evidence suggests an      improvement in the efficiency of work practices  Quick image availability can      impact on work associated with clinical decision-making, although the results      were inconsistent  PACS can change communication practices, particularly between       the ICU and radiology; however, the evidence base is insufficient to draw firm      conclusions in this area ConclusionThe potential for PACS to impact positively on      clinician work practices in the ICU and improve patient care is great  However,      the evidence base is limited and does not reflect aspects of contemporary PACS      technology  Performance measures developed in previous studies remain relevant,      with much left to investigate to understand how PACS can support new and improved      ways of delivering care in the intensive care setting

PMID- 22319180   - OBJECTIVE: Although trait-associated genes identified as complex versus      single-gene inheritance differ substantially in odds ratio, the authors      nonetheless posit that their mechanistic concordance can reveal fundamental      properties of the genetic architecture, allowing the automated interpretation of       unique polymorphisms within a personal genome  MATERIALS AND METHODS: An      analytical method, SPADE-gen, spanning three biological scales was developed to      demonstrate the mechanistic concordance between Mendelian and complex inheritance      of Alzheimer's disease  AD  genes: biological functions  BP , protein interaction      modeling, and protein domain implicated in the disease-associated polymorphism       RESULTS: Among Gene Ontology  GO  biological processes  BP  enriched at a false      detection rate <5% in 15 AD genes of Mendelian inheritance  Online Mendelian      Inheritance in Man  and independently in those of complex inheritance  25 host      genes of intragenic AD single-nucleotide polymorphisms confirmed in genome-wide      association studies , 16 overlapped  empirical p=0 007  and 45 were similar      empirical p<0 009; information theory   SPAN network modeling extended the      canonical pathway of AD  KEGG  with 26 new protein interactions  empirical      p<0 0001   DISCUSSION: The study prioritized new AD-associated biological      mechanisms and focused the analysis on previously unreported interactions      associated with the biological processes of polymorphisms that affect specific      protein domains within characterized AD genes and their direct interactors using        1  concordant GO-BP and  2  domain interactions within STRING protein-protein      interactions corresponding to the genomic location of the AD polymorphism  eg,      EPHA1, APOE, and CD2AP   CONCLUSION: These results are in line with unique-event       polymorphism theory, indicating how disease-associated polymorphisms of Mendelian      or complex inheritance relate genetically to those observed as 'unique personal      variants'  They also provide insight for identifying novel targets, for     repositioning drugs, and for personal therapeutics

PMID- 22319179   - BACKGROUND: Since publication of the human genome in 2003, geneticists have been       interested in risk variant associations to resolve the etiology of traits and      complex diseases  The International HapMap Consortium undertook an effort to      catalog all common variation across the genome  variants with a minor allele      frequency  MAF  of at least 5% in one or more ethnic groups   HapMap along with      advances in genotyping technology led to genome-wide association studies which      have identified common variants associated with many traits and diseases  In 2008      the 1000 Genomes Project aimed to sequence 2500 individuals and identify rare      variants and 99% of variants with a MAF of <1%  METHODS: To determine whether the      1000 Genomes Project includes all the variants in HapMap, we examined the overlap      between single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  genotyped in the two resources      using merged phase II/III HapMap data and low coverage pilot data from 1000      Genomes  RESULTS: Comparison of the two data sets showed that approximately 72%      of HapMap SNPs were also found in 1000 Genomes Project pilot data  After     filtering out HapMap variants with a MAF of <5%  separately for each population ,      99% of HapMap SNPs were found in 1000 Genomes data  CONCLUSIONS: Not all variants      cataloged in HapMap are also cataloged in 1000 Genomes  This could affect      decisions about which resource to use for SNP queries, rare variant validation,      or imputation  Both the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project databases are useful      resources for human genetics, but it is important to understand the assumptions      made and filtering strategies employed by these projects

PMID- 22319178   - OBJECTIVE: We demonstrate a genome-wide method for the integration of many      studies of gene expression of phenotypically similar disease processes, a method       of multiplex meta-analysis  We use immune dysfunction as an example disease      process  DESIGN: We use a heterogeneous collection of datasets across human and      mice samples from a range of tissues and different forms of immunodeficiency  We       developed a method integrating Tibshirani's modified t-test  SAM  is used to      interrogate differential expression within a study and Fisher's method for     omnibus meta-analysis to identify differentially expressed genes across studies        The ability of this overall gene expression profile to prioritize disease      associated genes is evaluated by comparing against the results of a recent genome      wide association study for common variable immunodeficiency  CVID   RESULTS: Our       approach is able to prioritize genes associated with immunodeficiency in general        area under the ROC curve = 0 713  and CVID in particular  area under the ROC      curve = 0 643   CONCLUSIONS: This approach may be used to investigate a larger     range of failures of the immune system  Our method may be extended to other     disease processes, using RNA levels to prioritize genes likely to contain disease      associated DNA variants

PMID- 22319177   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With recent breakthroughs in high-throughput      sequencing, identifying deleterious mutations is one of the key challenges for     personalized medicine  At the gene and protein level, it has proven difficult to       determine the impact of previously unknown variants  A statistical method has      been developed to assess the significance of disease mutation clusters on protein      domains by incorporating domain functional annotations to assist in the      functional characterization of novel variants  METHODS: Disease mutations      aggregated from multiple databases were mapped to domains, and were classified as      either cancer- or non-cancer-related  The statistical method for identifying      significantly disease-associated domain positions was applied to both sets of      mutations and to randomly generated mutation sets for comparison  To leverage the      known function of protein domain regions, the method optionally distributes      significant scores to associated functional feature positions  RESULTS: Most      disease mutations are localized within protein domains and display a tendency to       cluster at individual domain positions  The method identified significant disease      mutation hotspots in both the cancer and non-cancer datasets  The domain      significance scores  DS-scores  for cancer form a bimodal distribution with      hotspots in oncogenes forming a second peak at higher DS-scores than non-cancer,       and hotspots in tumor suppressors have scores more similar to non-cancers  In      addition, on an independent mutation benchmarking set, the DS-score method      identified mutations known to alter protein function with very high precision       CONCLUSION: By aggregating mutations with known disease association at the domain      level, the method was able to discover domain positions enriched with multiple      occurrences of deleterious mutations while incorporating relevant functional      annotations  The method can be incorporated into translational bioinformatics      tools to characterize rare and novel variants within large-scale sequencing      studies

PMID- 22319176   - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest in using electronic health records  EHRs       to identify subjects for genomic association studies, due in part to the      availability of large amounts of clinical data and the expected cost efficiencies      of subject identification  We describe the construction and validation of an      EHR-based algorithm to identify subjects with age-related cataracts  MATERIALS      AND METHODS: We used a multi-modal strategy consisting of structured database      querying, natural language processing on free-text documents, and optical      character recognition on scanned clinical images to identify cataract subjects      and related cataract attributes  Extensive validation on 3657 subjects compared      the multi-modal results to manual chart review  The algorithm was also      implemented at participating electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics  eMERGE       institutions  RESULTS: An EHR-based cataract phenotyping algorithm was      successfully developed and validated, resulting in positive predictive values       PPVs  >95%  The multi-modal approach increased the identification of cataract      subject attributes by a factor of three compared to single-mode approaches while       maintaining high PPV  Components of the cataract algorithm were successfully      deployed at three other institutions with similar accuracy  DISCUSSION: A      multi-modal strategy incorporating optical character recognition and natural      language processing may increase the number of cases identified while maintaining      similar PPVs  Such algorithms, however, require that the needed information be      embedded within clinical documents  CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that      algorithms to identify and characterize cataracts can be developed utilizing data      collected via the EHR  These algorithms provide a high level of accuracy even      when implemented across multiple EHRs and institutional boundaries

PMID- 22306113   - This report, based on a workshop jointly sponsored the National Institute of      Biomedical Imaging and Biomedical Engineering and the Office of the National      Coordinator for Health Information Technology, examines the role and value of      images as multimedia data in electronic health records  EHRs   The workshop,      attended by a wide range of stakeholders, was motivated in part by the absence of      image data from discussions of meaningful use of health information technology       Collectively, the workshop presenters and participants argued that images are not      ancillary data and should be central to health information systems to facilitate       clinical decisions and higher quality, efficiency, and safety of care  They      emphasized that the imaging community has already developed standards that form      the basis of interoperability  Despite the apparent value of images, workshop      participants also identified challenges and barriers to their implementation      within EHRs  Weighing the opportunities and challenges, workshop participants      provided their perspectives on possible paths forward toward fully multimedia      EHRs

PMID- 22298567   - ObjectivesTo address the challenge of balancing privacy with the need to create      cross-site research registry records on individual patients, while matching the      data for a given patient as he or she moves between participating sites  To      evaluate the strategy of generating anonymous identifiers based on real      identifiers in such a way that the chances of a shared patient being accurately      identified were maximized, and the chances of incorrectly joining two records      belonging to different people were minimized MethodsOur hypothesis was that most       variation in names occurs after the first two letters, and that date of birth is       highly reliable, so a single match variable consisting of a hashed string built      from the first two letters of the patient's first and last names plus their date       of birth would have the desired characteristics  We compared and contrasted the      match algorithm characteristics  rate of false positive v  rate of false      negative  for our chosen variable against both Social Security Numbers and full      names ResultsIn a data set of 19 000 records, a derived match variable consisting      of a 2-character prefix from both first and last names combined with date of      birth has a 97% sensitivity; by contrast, an anonymized identifier based on the      patient's full names and date of birth has a sensitivity of only 87% and SSN has       sensitivity 86% ConclusionThe approach we describe is most useful in situations      where privacy policies preclude the full exchange of the identifiers required by       more sophisticated and sensitive linkage algorithms  For data sets of      sufficiently high quality this effective approach, while producing a lower rate      of matching than more complex algorithms, has the merit of being easy to explain       to institutional review boards, adheres to the minimum necessary rule of the      HIPAA privacy rule, and is faster and less cumbersome to implement than a full      probabilistic linkage

PMID- 22298566   - Real-time locating systems  RTLS  have the potential to enhance healthcare      systems through the live tracking of assets, patients and staff  This study      evaluated a commercially available RTLS system deployed in a clinical setting,      with three objectives:  1  assessment of the location accuracy of the technology       in a clinical setting;  2  assessment of the value of asset tracking to staff;      and  3  assessment of threshold monitoring applications developed for patient      tracking and inventory control  Simulated daily activities were monitored by RTLS      and compared with direct research team observations  Staff surveys and interviews      concerning the system's effectiveness and accuracy were also conducted and      analyzed  The study showed only modest location accuracy, and mixed reactions in       staff interviews  These findings reveal that the technology needs to be refined      further for better specific location accuracy before full-scale implementation      can be recommended

PMID- 22298565   - ObjectiveTo research computational methods for coreference resolution in the      clinical narrative and build a system implementing the best methods MethodsThe      Ontology Development and Information Extraction corpus annotated for coreference       relations consists of 7214 coreferential markables, forming 5992 pairs and 1304      chains  We trained classifiers with semantic, syntactic, and surface features      pruned by feature selection  For the three system components-for the resolution      of relative pronouns, personal pronouns, and noun phrases-we experimented with      support vector machines with linear and radial basis function  RBF  kernels,      decision trees, and perceptrons  Evaluation of algorithms and varied feature sets      was performed using standard metrics ResultsThe best performing combination is      support vector machines with an RBF kernel and all features  MUC score=0 352,      B 3 =0 690, CEAF=0 486, BLANC=0 596  outperforming a traditional decision tree      baseline DiscussionThe application showed good performance similar to performance      on general English text  The main error source was sentence distances exceeding a      window of 10 sentences between markables  A possible solution to this problem is       hinted at by the fact that coreferent markables sometimes occurred in predictable       although distant  note sections  Another system limitation is failure to fully      utilize synonymy and ontological knowledge  Future work will investigate      additional ways to incorporate syntactic features into the coreference      problem ConclusionWe investigated computational methods for coreference      resolution in the clinical narrative  The best methods are released as modules of      the open source Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System and      Ontology Development and Information Extraction platforms

PMID- 22291166   - Because breast tissue composition partially predicts breast cancer risk,      classification of mammography reports by breast tissue composition is important      from both a scientific and clinical perspective  A method is presented for using       the unstructured text of mammography reports to classify them into BI-RADS breast      tissue composition categories  An algorithm that uses regular expressions to      automatically determine BI-RADS breast tissue composition classes for     unstructured mammography reports was developed  The algorithm assigns each report      to a single BI-RADS composition class: 'fatty', 'fibroglandular',      'heterogeneously dense', 'dense', or 'unspecified'  We evaluated its performance       on mammography reports from two different institutions  The method achieves >99%       classification accuracy on a test set of reports from the Marshfield Clinic       Wisconsin  and Stanford University  Since large-scale studies of breast cancer     rely heavily on breast tissue composition information, this method could      facilitate this research by helping mine large datasets to correlate breast      composition with other covariates

PMID- 22278382   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Morphologic variations of disease are often linked to      underlying molecular events and patient outcome, suggesting that quantitative      morphometric analysis may provide further insight into disease mechanisms  In      this paper a methodology for the subclassification of disease is developed using       image analysis techniques  Morphologic signatures that represent patient-specific      tumor morphology are derived from the analysis of hundreds of millions of cells      in digitized whole slide images  Clustering these signatures aggregates tumors      into groups with cohesive morphologic characteristics  This methodology is      demonstrated with an analysis of glioblastoma, using data from The Cancer Genome       Atlas to identify a prognostically significant morphology-driven      subclassification, in which clusters are correlated with transcriptional,      genetic, and epigenetic events  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methodology was applied to      162 glioblastomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify morphology-driven      clusters and their clinical and molecular correlates  Signatures of      patient-specific tumor morphology were generated from analysis of 200 million      cells in 462 whole slide images  Morphology-driven clusters were interrogated for     associations with patient outcome, response to therapy, molecular     classifications, and genetic alterations  An additional layer of deep,      genome-wide analysis identified characteristic transcriptional, epigenetic, and      copy number variation events  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Analysis of glioblastoma      identified three prognostically significant patient clusters  median survival      15 3, 10 7, and 13 0 months, log rank p=1 4e-3   Clustering results were      validated in a separate dataset  Clusters were characterized by molecular events       in nuclear compartment signaling including developmental and cell cycle      checkpoint pathways  This analysis demonstrates the potential of high-throughput       morphometrics for the subclassification of disease, establishing an approach that      complements genomics

PMID- 22278381   - OBJECTIVE: Thousands of complex-disease single-nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs       have been discovered in genome-wide association studies  GWAS   However, these      intragenic SNPs have not been collectively mined to unveil the genetic      architecture between complex clinical traits  The authors hypothesize that      biological annotations of host genes of trait-associated SNPs may reveal the      biomolecular modularity across complex-disease traits and offer insights for drug      repositioning  METHODS: Trait-to-polymorphism  SNPs  associations confirmed in      GWAS were used  A novel method to quantify trait-trait similarity anchored in      Gene Ontology annotations of human proteins and information theory was developed       The results were then validated with the shortest paths of physical protein      interactions between biologically similar traits  RESULTS: A network was      constructed consisting of 280 significant intertrait similarities among 177      disease traits, which covered 1438 well-validated disease-associated SNPs       Thirty-nine percent of intertrait connections were confirmed by curators, and the      following additional studies demonstrated the validity of a proportion of the      remainder  On a phenotypic trait level, higher Gene Ontology similarity between      proteins correlated with smaller 'shortest distance' in protein interaction      networks of complexly inherited diseases  Spearman p<2 2x10 -16    Further,      'cancer traits' were similar to one another, as were 'metabolic syndrome traits'        Fisher's exact test p=0 001 and 3 5x10 -7 , respectively   CONCLUSION: An      imputed disease network by information-anchored functional similarity from GWAS      trait-associated SNPs is reported  It is also demonstrated that small shortest      paths of protein interactions correlate with complex-disease function  Taken      together, these findings provide the framework for investigating drug targets      with unbiased functional biomolecular networks rather than worn-out single-gene      and subjective canonical pathway approaches

PMID- 22268218   - In the midst of a US $30 billion USD investment in the Nationwide Health      Information Network  NwHIN  and electronic health records systems, a significant       change in the architecture of the NwHIN is taking place  Prior to 2010, the focus      of information exchange in the NwHIN was the Regional Health Information      Organization  RHIO   Since 2010, the Office of the National Coordinator  ONC  has      been sponsoring policies that promote an internet-like architecture that      encourages point to-point information exchange and private health information      exchange networks  The net effect of these activities is to undercut the limited       business model for RHIOs, decreasing the likelihood of their success, while      making the NwHIN dependent on nascent technologies for community level functions       such as record locator services  These changes may impact the health of patients       and communities  Independent, scientifically focused debate is needed on the      wisdom of ONC's proposed changes in its strategy for the NwHIN

PMID- 22268217   - ObjectivesTo study ontology modularization techniques when applied to SNOMED CT      in a scenario in which no previous corpus of information exists and to examine if      frequency-based filtering using MEDLINE can reduce subset size without discarding      relevant concepts Materials and MethodsSubsets were first extracted using four     graph-traversal heuristics and one logic-based technique, and were subsequently      filtered with frequency information from MEDLINE  Twenty manually coded discharge      summaries from cardiology patients were used as signatures and test sets  The      coverage, size, and precision of extracted subsets were      measured ResultsGraph-traversal heuristics provided high coverage  71-96% of      terms in the test sets of discharge summaries  at the expense of subset size       17-51% of the size of SNOMED CT   Pre-computed subsets and logic-based      techniques extracted small subsets  1% , but coverage was limited  24-55%        Filtering reduced the size of large subsets to 10% while still providing 80%      coverage DiscussionExtracting subsets to annotate discharge summaries is      challenging when no previous corpus exists  Ontology modularization provides      valuable techniques, but the resulting modules grow as signatures spread across      subhierarchies, yielding a very low precision ConclusionGraph-traversal      strategies and frequency data from an authoritative source can prune large      biomedical ontologies and produce useful subsets that still exhibit acceptable      coverage  However, a clinical corpus closer to the specific use case is preferred      when available

PMID- 22268215   - BackgroundNational organizations historically focused on increasing use of      effective services are now attempting to identify and discourage use of low-value      services  Electronic health records  EHRs  could be used to measure use of      low-value services, but few studies have examined this  The aim of the study was       to:  1  determine if EHR data can be used to identify women eligible for an      extended Pap testing interval;  2  determine the proportion of these women who      received a Pap test sooner than recommended; and  3  assess the consequences of      these low-value Pap tests MethodsElectronic query of EHR data identified women      aged 30-65 years old who were at low-risk of cervical cancer and therefore      eligible for an extended Pap testing interval of 3 years  as per professional      society guidelines   Manual chart review assessed query accuracy  The use of      low-value Pap tests  ie, those performed sooner than recommended  was measured,      and adverse consequences of low-value Pap tests  ie, colposcopies performed as a       result of low-value Pap tests  were identified ResultsManual chart review      confirmed query accuracy  Two-thirds  1120/1705  of low-risk women received a Pap      test sooner than recommended, and 21 colposcopies were performed as a result of      this low-value Pap testing ConclusionSecondary analysis of EHR data can      accurately measure the use of low-value services such as Pap testing performed      sooner than recommended in women at low risk of cervical cancer  Similar     application of our methodology could facilitate efforts to simultaneously improve      quality and decrease costs, maximizing value in the US healthcare system

PMID- 22268214   - Physicians are often unaware of the results of tests pending at discharge       TPADs   The authors designed and implemented an automated system to notify the      responsible inpatient physician of the finalized results of TPADs using secure,      network email  The system coordinates a series of electronic events triggered by       the discharge time stamp and sends an email to the identified discharging      attending physician once finalized results are available  A carbon copy is sent      to the primary care physicians in order to facilitate communication and the      subsequent transfer of responsibility  Logic was incorporated to suppress      selected tests and to limit notification volume  The system was activated for     patients with TPADs discharged by randomly selected inpatient-attending      physicians during a 6-month pilot  They received approximately 1 6 email      notifications per discharged patient with TPADs  Eighty-four per cent of      inpatient-attending physicians receiving automated email notifications stated      that they were satisfied with the system in a brief survey  59% survey response      rate   Automated email notification is a useful strategy for managing results of       TPADs

PMID- 22249968   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate data fragmentation across healthcare centers with regard      to the accuracy of a high-throughput clinical phenotyping  HTCP  algorithm      developed to differentiate  1  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  T2DM  and        2  patients with no diabetes  MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population-based study      identified all Olmsted County, Minnesota residents in 2007  We used      provider-linked electronic medical record data from the two healthcare centers      that provide >95% of all care to County residents  ie, Olmsted Medical Center and      Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, USA   Subjects were limited to residents      with one or more encounter January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 at both      healthcare centers  DM-relevant data on diagnoses, laboratory results, and      medication from both centers were obtained during this period  The algorithm was       first executed using data from both centers  ie, the gold standard  and then from      Mayo Clinic alone  Positive predictive values and false-negative rates were      calculated, and the McNemar test was used to compare categorization when data      from the Mayo Clinic alone were used with the gold standard  Age and sex were      compared between true-positive and false-negative subjects with T2DM  Statistical      significance was accepted as p<0 05  RESULTS: With data from both medical      centers, 765 subjects with T2DM  4256 non-DM subjects  were identified  When      single-center data were used, 252 T2DM subjects  1573 non-DM subjects  were      missed; an additional false-positive 27 T2DM subjects  215 non-DM subjects  were       identified  The positive predictive values and false-negative rates were 95 0%       513/540  and 32 9%  252/765 , respectively, for T2DM subjects and 92 6%       2683/2898  and 37 0%  1573/4256 , respectively, for non-DM subjects  Age and sex      distribution differed between true-positive  mean age 62 1; 45% female  and      false-negative  mean age 65 0; 56 0% female  T2DM subjects  CONCLUSION: The      findings show that application of an HTCP algorithm using data from a single      medical center contributes to misclassification  These findings should be      considered carefully by researchers when developing and executing HTCP      algorithms

PMID- 22249967   - BackgroundSince 2007, New York City's primary care information project has      assisted over 3000 providers to adopt and use a prevention-oriented electronic      health record  EHR   Participating practices were taught to re-adjust their     workflows to use the EHR built-in population health monitoring tools, including      automated quality measures, patient registries and a clinical decision support      system  Practices received a comprehensive suite of technical assistance, which      included quality improvement, EHR customization and configuration, privacy and      security training, and revenue cycle optimization  These services were aimed at      helping providers understand how to use their EHR to track and improve the      quality of care delivered to patients Materials and MethodsRetrospective      electronic chart reviews of 4081 patient records across 57 practices were      analyzed to determine the validity of EHR-derived quality measures and documented      preventive services ResultsResults from this study show that workflow and      documentation habits have a profound impact on EHR-derived quality measures       Compared with the manual review of electronic charts, EHR-derived measures can      undercount practice performance, with a disproportionately negative impact on the      number of patients captured as receiving a clinical preventive service or meeting      a recommended treatment goal ConclusionThis study provides a cautionary note in      using EHR-derived measurement for public reporting of provider performance or use      for payment

PMID- 22249966   - The performance of a classification system depends on the context in which it      will be used, including the prevalence of the classes and the relative costs of      different types of errors  Metrics such as accuracy are limited to the context in      which the experiment was originally carried out, and metrics such as sensitivity,      specificity, and receiver operating characteristic area-while independent of      prevalence-do not provide a clear picture of the performance characteristics of      the system over different contexts  Graphing a prevalence-specific metric such as      F-measure or the relative cost of errors over a wide range of prevalence allows a      visualization of the performance of the system and a comparison of systems in      different contexts

PMID- 22237866   - The authors developed a computer-based general medical history to be taken by      patients in their homes over the internet before their first visit with their     primary care doctor, and asked six doctors and their participating patients to      assess this history and its effect on their subsequent visit  Forty patients      began the history; 32 completed the history and post-history assessment      questionnaire and were for the most part positive in their assessment; and 23      continued on to complete their post-visit assessment questionnaire and were for     the most part positive about the helpfulness of the history and its summary at      the time of their visit with the doctor  The doctors in turn strongly favored the      immediate, routine use of two modules of the history-the family and social      histories-for all their new patients  The doctors suggested further that the      summaries of the other modules of the history be revised and shortened to make it      easier for them to focus on clinical issues in the order of their preference

PMID- 22227640   - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between diseases and their causative genes can be      complex, especially in the case of polygenic diseases  Further exacerbating the      challenges in their study is that many genes may be causally related to multiple       diseases  This study explored the relationship between diseases through the      adaptation of an approach pioneered in the context of information retrieval:      vector space models  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A vector space model approach was      developed that bridges gene disease knowledge inferred across three knowledge      bases: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GenBank, and Medline  The approach      was then used to identify potentially related diseases for two target diseases:      Alzheimer disease and Prader-Willi Syndrome  RESULTS: In the case of both      Alzheimer Disease and Prader-Willi Syndrome, a set of plausible diseases were      identified that may warrant further exploration  DISCUSSION: This study furthers       seminal work by Swanson, et al  that demonstrated the potential for mining      literature for putative correlations  Using a vector space modeling approach,      information from both biomedical literature and genomic resources  like GenBank        can be combined towards identification of putative correlations of interest  To      this end, the relevance of the predicted diseases of interest in this study using      the vector space modeling approach were validated based on supporting literature       CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a vector space model approach       may be a useful means to identify potential relationships between complex      diseases, and thereby enable the coordination of gene-based findings across      multiple complex diseases

PMID- 22190040   - OBJECTIVE: A complex disease is generally caused by the mutation of multiple      genes or by the dysfunction of multiple biological processes  Systematic      identification of causal disease genes and module biomarkers can provide insights      into the mechanisms underlying complex diseases, and help develop efficient      therapies or effective drugs  MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we present a       novel approach to predict disease genes and identify dysfunctional networks or     modules, based on the analysis of differential interactions between disease and      control samples, in contrast to the analysis of differential gene or protein      expressions widely adopted in existing methods  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As an      example, we applied our method to the study of three-stage microarray data for     gastric cancer  We identified network modules or module biomarkers that include a      set of genes related to gastric cancer, implying the predictive power of our     method  The results on holdout validation data sets show that our identified      module can serve as an effective module biomarker for accurately detecting or     diagnosing gastric cancer, thereby validating the efficiency of our method       CONCLUSION: We proposed a new approach to detect module biomarkers for diseases,       and the results on gastric cancer demonstrated that the differential interactions      are useful to detect dysfunctional modules in the molecular interaction network,       which in turn can be used as robust module biomarkers

PMID- 22116642   - Over the next 10 years, more information and communication technology  ICT  will       be deployed in the health system than in its entire previous history  Systems      will be larger in scope, more complex, and move from regional to national and      supranational scale  Yet we are at roughly the same place the aviation industry      was in the 1950s with respect to system safety  Even if ICT harm rates do not      increase, increased ICT use will increase the absolute number of ICT related      harms  Factors that could diminish ICT harm include adoption of common standards,      technology maturity, better system development, testing, implementation and end      user training  Factors that will increase harm rates include complexity and      heterogeneity of systems and their interfaces, rapid implementation and poor     training of users  Mitigating these harms will not be easy, as organizational      inertia is likely to generate a hysteresis-like lag, where the paths to increase       and decrease harm are not identical

PMID- 22101970   - OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies  GWAS  require high specificity and      large numbers of subjects to identify genotype-phenotype correlations accurately       The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes  T2D  cases and controls      for a GWAS, using data captured through routine clinical care across five      institutions using different electronic medical record  EMR  systems  MATERIALS      AND METHODS: An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based       on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results  The      performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating      institutions compared against clinician review  A GWAS was subsequently performed      using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across       all five institutions  RESULTS: The algorithm achieved 98% and 100% positive      predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls,      respectively, as compared against clinician review  By standardizing and applying      the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified        Subsequent GWAS using data from five institutions replicated the TCF7L2 gene      variant  rs7903146  previously associated with T2D  DISCUSSION: By applying      stringent criteria to EMR data collected through routine clinical care, cases and      controls for a GWAS were identified that subsequently replicated a known genetic       variant  The use of standard terminologies to define data elements enabled      pooling of subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the      robust numbers required for GWAS  CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm using commonly      available data from five different EMR can accurately identify T2D cases and      controls for genetic study across multiple institutions

PMID- 22101907   - OBJECTIVE: A core feature of e-prescribing is the electronic exchange of      prescription data between physician practices and pharmacies, which can      potentially improve the efficiency of the prescribing process and reduce      medication errors  Barriers to implementing this feature exist, but they are not       well understood  This study's objectives were to explore recent physician      practice and pharmacy experiences with electronic transmission of new      prescriptions and renewals, and identify facilitators of and barriers to      effective electronic transmission and pharmacy e-prescription processing  DESIGN:      Qualitative analysis of 114 telephone interviews conducted with representatives      from 97 organizations between February and September 2010, including 24 physician      practices, 48 community pharmacies, and three mail-order pharmacies actively      transmitting or receiving e-prescriptions via Surescripts  RESULTS: Practices and      pharmacies generally were satisfied with electronic transmission of new      prescriptions but reported that the electronic renewal process was used      inconsistently, resulting in inefficient workarounds for both parties  Practice      communications with mail-order pharmacies were less likely to be electronic than       with community pharmacies because of underlying transmission network and computer     system limitations  While e-prescribing reduced manual prescription entry,      pharmacy staff frequently had to complete or edit certain fields, particularly      drug name and patient instructions  CONCLUSIONS: Electronic transmission of new      prescriptions has matured  Changes in technical standards and system design and      more targeted physician and pharmacy training may be needed to address barriers      to e-renewals, mail-order pharmacy connectivity, and pharmacy processing of      e-prescriptions

PMID- 22101906   - In a randomized trial of a clinical decision support system for drug prescribing       for residents with renal insufficiency in a large long-term care facility,      analyses were conducted to estimate the system's immediate, direct financial      impact  We determined the costs that would have been incurred if drug orders that      triggered the alert system had actually been completed compared to the costs of      the final submitted orders and then compared intervention units to control units       The costs incurred by additional laboratory testing that resulted from alerts      were also estimated  Drug orders were conservatively assigned a duration of 30      days of use for a chronic drug and 10 days for antibiotics  It was determined      that there were modest reductions in drug costs, partially offset by an increase       in laboratory-related costs  Overall, there was a reduction in direct costs       US$1391 43, net 7 6% reduction   However, sensitivity analyses based on      alternative estimates of duration of drug use suggested a reduction as high as      US$7998 33 if orders for non-antibiotic drugs were assumed to be continued for     180 days  The authors conclude that the immediate and direct financial impact of       a clinical decision support system for medication ordering for residents with      renal insufficiency is modest and that the primary motivation for such efforts      must be to improve the quality and safety of medication ordering

PMID- 22101905   - MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and       each regulate their own transcription and that of hundreds of genes, often in a      tissue-dependent manner  This creates a tightly interwoven network regulating and      underlying oncogenesis and cancer biology  Although protein-coding gene      signatures and single protein pathway markers have proliferated over the past      decade, routine adoption of the former has been hampered by interpretability,      reproducibility, and dimensionality, whereas the single molecule-phenotype      reductionism of the latter is often overly simplistic to account for complex      phenotypes  MicroRNA-derived biomarkers offer a powerful alternative; they have      both the flexibility of gene expression signature classifiers and the desirable      mechanistic transparency of single protein biomarkers  Furthermore, several      advances have recently demonstrated the robust detection of microRNAs from      various biofluids, thus providing an additional opportunity for obtaining      bioinformatically derived biomarkers to accelerate the identification of      individual patients for personalized therapy

PMID- 22084201   - The identification and grading of adverse events  AEs  during the conduct of      clinical trials is a labor-intensive and error-prone process  This paper     describes and evaluates a software tool developed by City of Hope to automate      complex algorithms to assess laboratory results and identify and grade AEs  We      compared AEs identified by the automated system with those previously assessed      manually, to evaluate missed/misgraded AEs  We also conducted a prospective      paired time assessment of automated versus manual AE assessment  We found a      substantial improvement in accuracy/completeness with the automated grading tool,      which identified an additional 17% of severe grade 3-4 AEs that had been      missed/misgraded manually  The automated system also provided an average time      saving of 5 5 min per treatment course  With 400 ongoing treatment trials at City      of Hope and an average of 1800 laboratory results requiring assessment per study,      the implications of these findings for patient safety are enormous

PMID- 22081222   - Physics-based simulation provides a powerful framework for understanding      biological form and function  Simulations can be used by biologists to study      macromolecular assemblies and by clinicians to design treatments for diseases       Simulations help biomedical researchers understand the physical constraints on      biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, synthetic tissues, medical      devices, and surgical interventions  Although individual biomedical investigators      make outstanding contributions to physics-based simulation, the field has been      fragmented  Applications are typically limited to a single physical scale, and      individual investigators usually must create their own software  These conditions      created a major barrier to advancing simulation capabilities  In 2004, we      established a National Center for Physics-Based Simulation of Biological      Structures  Simbios  to help integrate the field and accelerate biomedical      research  In 6 years, Simbios has become a vibrant national center, with      collaborators in 16 states and eight countries  Simbios focuses on problems at      both the molecular scale and the organismal level, with a long-term goal of      uniting these in accurate multiscale simulations

PMID- 22052900   - BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems  CDSSs  are believed to enhance      patient care and reduce healthcare costs; however the current evidence is limited      and the cost-effectiveness remains unknown  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term       cost-effectiveness of a CDSS linked to evidence-based treatment recommendations      for type 2 diabetes  METHODS: Using the Ontario Diabetes Economic Model, changes       in factors  eg, HbA1c  from a randomized controlled trial were used to estimate      cost-effectiveness  The cost of implementation, development, and maintenance of      the core dataset, and projected diabetes-related complications were included  The      base case assumed a 1-year treatment effect, 5% discount rate, and 40-year time      horizon  Univariate, one-way sensitivity analyses were carried out by altering      different parameter values  The perspective was the Ontario Ministry of Health      and costs were in 2010 Canadian dollars  RESULTS: The cost of implementing the      intervention was $483,699  The one-year intervention reduced HbA1c by 0 2 and      systolic blood pressure by 3 95 mm Hg, but increased body mass index by 0 02      kg/m 2 , resulting in a relative risk reduction of 14% in the occurrence of      amputation  The model estimated that the intervention resulted in an additional      0 0117 quality-adjusted life year; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was      $160,845 per quality-adjusted life-year  CONCLUSION: The web-based prototype      decision support system slightly improved short-term risk factors  The model      predicted moderate improvements in long-term health outcomes  This disease      management program will need to develop considerable efficiencies in terms of      costs and processes or improved effectiveness to be considered a cost-effective      intervention for treating patients with type 2 diabetes

PMID- 22052897   - Implementing electronic health records  EHR  in healthcare settings incurs      challenges, none more important than maintaining efficiency and safety during      rollout  This report quantifies the impact of offloading low-acuity visits to an       alternative care site from the emergency department  ED  during EHR     implementation  In addition, the report evaluated the effect of EHR     implementation on overall patient length of stay  LOS , time to medical provider,      and provider productivity during implementation of the EHR  Overall LOS and time       to doctor increased during EHR implementation  On average, admitted patients' LOS      was 6-20% longer  For discharged patients, LOS was 12-22% longer  Attempts to      reduce patient volumes by diverting patients to another clinic were not effective      in minimizing delays in care during this EHR implementation  Delays in ED      throughput during EHR implementation are real and significant despite additional       providers in the ED, and in this setting resolved by 3 months      post-implementation

PMID- 22037893   - OBJECTIVE: Systematic analysis of observational medical databases for active      safety surveillance is hindered by the variation in data models and coding      systems  Data analysts often find robust clinical data models difficult to      understand and ill suited to support their analytic approaches  Further, some      models do not facilitate the computations required for systematic analysis across      many interventions and outcomes for large datasets  Translating the data from      these idiosyncratic data models to a common data model  CDM  could facilitate      both the analysts' understanding and the suitability for large-scale systematic      analysis  In addition to facilitating analysis, a suitable CDM has to faithfully       represent the source observational database  Before beginning to use the      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership  OMOP  CDM and a related dictionary of      standardized terminologies for a study of large-scale systematic active safety      surveillance, the authors validated the model's suitability for this use by      example  VALIDATION BY EXAMPLE: To validate the OMOP CDM, the model was      instantiated into a relational database, data from 10 different observational      healthcare databases were loaded into separate instances, a comprehensive array      of analytic methods that operate on the data model was created, and these methods      were executed against the databases to measure performance  CONCLUSION: There was      acceptable representation of the data from 10 observational databases in the OMOP      CDM using the standardized terminologies selected, and a range of analytic      methods was developed and executed with sufficient performance to be useful for     active safety surveillance

PMID- 22037892   - The rapid advance of gene sequencing technologies has produced an unprecedented      rate of discovery of genome variation in humans  A growing number of      authoritative clinical repositories archive gene variants and disease phenotypes,      yet there are currently many more gene variants that lack clear annotation or     disease association  To date, there has been very limited coverage of      gene-specific predictors in the literature  Here the evaluation is presented of      "gene-specific" predictor models based on a naive Bayesian classifier for 20      gene-disease datasets, containing 3986 variants with clinically characterized      patient conditions  The utility of gene-specific prediction is then compared with      "all-gene" generalized prediction and also with existing popular predictors       Gene-specific computational prediction models derived from clinically curated      gene variant disease datasets often outperform established generalized algorithms      for novel and uncertain gene variants

PMID- 22037887   - While much attention has been paid to the short-term impact that widespread      adoption of health information technology  health IT  will have on the healthcare      system, there is a corresponding need to look at the long-term effects that      extant policies may have on health IT system resilience, innovation, and related       ethical, social/legal issues  The American Medical Informatics Association's 2010      Health Policy Conference was convened to further the national discourse on the      issues surrounding these longer-term considerations  Conference participants      self-selected into three broad categories: resilience in healthcare and health      IT; ethical, legal, and social challenges; and innovation, adoption, and      sustainability  The discussions about problem areas lead to findings focusing on       the lack of encouragement for long-term IT innovation that may result from      current health IT policies; the potential impact of uneven adoption of health IT       based on the exclusions of the current financial incentives; the weaknesses of      contingency and risk mitigation planning that threaten system resilience; and      evolving standards developed in response to challenges relating to the security,       integrity, and availability of electronic health information  This paper     discusses these findings and also offers recommendations that address the      interwoven topics of innovation, resilience, and adoption  The goal of this paper     is to encourage public and private sector organizations that have a role in      shaping health information policy to increase attention to developing a national       strategy that assures that health IT innovation and resilience are not impeded by      shorter-term efforts to implement current approaches emphasizing adoption and      meaningful use of electronic health records

PMID- 22003156   - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of how      a health information exchange  HIE  fits into clinical workflow at multiple      clinical sites  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethnographic qualitative study was      conducted over a 9-month period in six emergency departments  ED  and eight      ambulatory clinics in Memphis, Tennessee, USA  Data were collected using direct      observation, informal interviews during observation, and formal semi-structured      interviews  The authors observed for over 180 h, during which providers used the       exchange 130 times  RESULTS: HIE-related workflow was modeled for each ED site      and ambulatory clinic group and substantial site-to-site workflow differences      were identified  Common patterns in HIE-related workflow were also identified      across all sites, leading to the development of two role-based workflow models:      nurse based and physician based  The workflow elements framework was applied to      the two role-based patterns  An in-depth description was developed of how      providers integrated HIE into existing clinical workflow, including prompts for     HIE use  DISCUSSION: Workflow differed substantially among sites, but two general      role-based HIE usage models were identified  Although providers used HIE to      improve continuity of patient care, patient-provider trust played a significant      role  Types of information retrieved related to roles, with nurses seeking to      retrieve recent hospitalization data and more open-ended usage by nurse      practitioners and physicians  User and role-specific customization to accommodate      differences in workflow and information needs may increase the adoption and use      of HIE  CONCLUSION: Understanding end users' perspectives towards HIE technology       is crucial to the long-term success of HIE  By applying qualitative methods, an      in-depth understanding of HIE usage was developed

PMID- 21984590   - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and synthesis of the evidence      surrounding the cost-effectiveness of health information technology  HIT  in the       medication process  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peer-reviewed electronic databases and      gray literature were searched to identify studies on HIT used to assist in the      medication management process  Articles including an economic component were      reviewed for further screening  For this review, full cost-effectiveness      analyses, cost-utility analyses and cost-benefit analyses, as well as cost      analyses, were eligible for inclusion and synthesis  RESULTS: The 31 studies      included were heterogeneous with respect to the HIT evaluated, setting, and      economic methods used  Thus the data could not be synthesized, and a narrative      review was conducted  Most studies evaluated computer decision support systems in      hospital settings in the USA, and only five of the studied performed full      economic evaluations  DISCUSSION: Most studies merely provided cost data;      however, useful economic data involves far more input  A full economic evaluation      includes a full enumeration of the costs, synthesized with the outcomes of the      intervention  CONCLUSION: The quality of the economic literature in this area is       poor  A few studies found that HIT may offer cost advantages despite their     increased acquisition costs  However, given the uncertainty that surrounds the      costs and outcomes data, and limited study designs, it is difficult to reach any       definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent      value for money  Sophisticated concurrent prospective economic evaluations need      to be conducted to address whether HIT interventions in the medication management      process are cost-effective

PMID- 21984587   - OBJECTIVE: Predictive models that generate individualized estimates for medically      relevant outcomes are playing increasing roles in clinical care and translational      research  However, current methods for calibrating these estimates lose valuable       information  Our goal is to develop a new calibration method to conserve as much       information as possible, and would compare favorably to existing methods in terms      of important performance measures: discrimination and calibration  MATERIAL AND      METHODS: We propose an adaptive technique that utilizes individualized confidence      intervals  CIs  to calibrate predictions  We evaluate this new method, adaptive      calibration of predictions  ACP , in artificial and real-world medical      classification problems, in terms of areas under the ROC curves, the      Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, mean squared error, and computational      complexity  RESULTS: ACP compared favorably to other calibration methods such as       binning, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression  In several experiments, binning,      isotonic regression, and Platt scaling failed to improve the calibration of a      logistic regression model, whereas ACP consistently improved the calibration      while maintaining the same discrimination or even improving it in some      experiments  In addition, the ACP algorithm is not computationally expensive       LIMITATIONS: The calculation of CIs for individual predictions may be cumbersome       for certain predictive models  ACP is not completely parameter-free: the length      of the CI employed may affect its results  CONCLUSIONS: ACP can generate      estimates that may be more suitable for individualized predictions than estimates      that are calibrated using existing methods  Further studies are necessary to      explore the limitations of ACP

PMID- 21976027   - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the web structure of two web-based continuing education      courses, identify problems and assess the effects of web site modifications       DESIGN: Markov chain models were built from 2008 web usage data to evaluate the      courses' web structure and navigation patterns  The web site was then modified to      resolve identified design issues and the improvement in user activity over the      subsequent 12 months was quantitatively evaluated  MEASUREMENTS: Web navigation      paths were collected between 2008 and 2010  The probability of navigating from      one web page to another was analyzed  RESULTS: The continuing education courses'       sequential structure design was clearly reflected in the resulting actual web      usage models, and none of the skip transitions provided was heavily used  The web      navigation patterns of the two different continuing education courses were      similar  Two possible design flaws were identified and fixed in only one of the      two courses  Over the following 12 months, the drop-out rate in the modified      course significantly decreased from 41% to 35%, but remained unchanged in the      unmodified course  The web improvement effects were further verified via a      second-order Markov chain model  CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that differences       in web content have less impact than web structure design on how learners      navigate through continuing education courses  Evaluation of user navigation can       help identify web design flaws and guide modifications  This study showed that      Markov chain models provide a valuable tool to evaluate web-based education      courses  Both the results and techniques in this study would be very useful for     public health education and research specialists

PMID- 21946239   - OBJECTIVE: To better understand barriers associated with the adoption and use of       electronic prescribing of controlled substances  EPCS , a practice recently      established by US Drug Enforcement Administration regulation  MATERIALS AND      METHODS: Prescribers of controlled substances affiliated with a regional health      system were surveyed regarding current electronic prescribing  e-prescribing       activities, current prescribing of controlled substances, and expectations and      barriers to the adoption of EPCS  RESULTS: 246 prescribers  response rate of 64%       represented a range of medical specialties, with 43 1% of these prescribers      current users of e-prescribing for non-controlled substances  Reported issues      with controlled substances included errors, pharmacy call-backs, and diversion;      most prescribers expected EPCS to address many of these problems, specifically      reduce medical errors, improve work flow and efficiency of practice, help      identify prescription diversion or misuse, and improve patient treatment      management  Prescribers expected, however, that it would be disruptive to      practice, and over one-third of respondents reported that carrying a security      authentication token at all times would be so burdensome as to discourage      adoption  DISCUSSION: Although adoption of e-prescribing has been shown to      dramatically reduce medication errors, challenges to efficient processes and      errors still persist from the perspective of the prescriber, that may interfere      with the adoption of EPCS  Most prescribers regarded EPCS security measures as a       small or moderate inconvenience  other than carrying a security token , with      advantages outweighing the burden  CONCLUSION: Prescribers are optimistic about      the potential for EPCS to improve practice, but view certain security measures as      a burden and potential barrier

PMID- 21946236   - OBJECTIVE: To understand the complex effects of interruption in healthcare       MATERIALS AND METHODS: As interruptions have been well studied in other domains,       the authors undertook a systematic review of experimental studies in psychology      and human-computer interaction to identify the task types and variables      influencing interruption effects  RESULTS: 63 studies were identified from 812      articles retrieved by systematic searches  On the basis of interruption profiles       for generic tasks, it was found that clinical tasks can be distinguished into      three broad types: procedural, problem-solving, and decision-making  Twelve      experimental variables that influence interruption effects were identified  Of      these, six are the most important, based on the number of studies and because of       their centrality to interruption effects, including working memory load,      interruption position, similarity, modality, handling strategies, and practice      effect  The variables are explained by three main theoretical frameworks: the      activation-based goal memory model, prospective memory, and multiple resource      theory  DISCUSSION: This review provides a useful starting point for a more      comprehensive examination of interruptions potentially leading to an improved      understanding about the impact of this phenomenon on patient safety and task      efficiency  The authors provide some recommendations to counter interruption      effects  CONCLUSION: The effects of interruption are the outcome of a complex set      of variables and should not be considered as uniformly predictable or bad  The      task types, variables, and theories should help us better to identify which      clinical tasks and contexts are most susceptible and assist in the design of      information systems and processes that are resilient to interruption

PMID- 21946235   - OBJECTIVES: To create user-friendly search filters with high sensitivity,      specificity, and precision to identify articles on geriatric medicine in Medline       DESIGN: A diagnostic test assessment framework was used  A reference set of 2255       articles was created by hand-searching 22 biomedical journals in Medline, and      each article was labeled as 'relevant', 'not relevant', or 'possibly relevant'      for geriatric medicine  From the relevant articles, search terms were identified       to compile different search strategies  The articles retrieved by the various      search strategies were compared with articles from the reference set as the index      test to create the search filters  MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, precision,      accuracy, and number-needed-to-read  NNR  were calculated by comparing the      results retrieved by the different search strategies with the reference set       RESULTS: The most sensitive search filter had a sensitivity of 94 8%, a      specificity of 88 7%, a precision of 73 0%, and an accuracy of 90 2%  It had an      NNR of 1 37  The most specific search filter had a specificity of 96 6%, a      sensitivity of 69 1%, a precision of 86 6%, and an accuracy of 89 9%  It had an      NNR of 1 15  CONCLUSION: These geriatric search filters simplify searching for     relevant literature and therefore contribute to better evidence-based practice       The filters are useful to both the clinician who wants to find a quick answer to       a clinical question and the researcher who wants to find as many relevant      articles as possible without retrieving too many irrelevant articles

PMID- 21917645   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether past access to biomedical documents can predict      future document access  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors used 394 days of query      log  August 1, 2009 to August 29, 2010  from PubMed users in the Texas Medical      Center, which is the largest medical center in the world  The authors evaluated      two document access models based on the work of Anderson and Schooler  The first       is based on how frequently a document was accessed  The second is based on both      frequency and recency  RESULTS: The model based only on frequency of past access       was highly correlated with the empirical data  R 2 =0 932 , whereas the model      based on frequency and recency had a much lower correlation  R 2 =0 668        DISCUSSION: The frequency-only model accurately predicted whether a document will      be accessed based on past use  Modeling accesses as a function of frequency      requires storing only the number of accesses and the creation date for the      document  This model requires low storage overheads and is computationally      efficient, making it scalable to large corpora such as MEDLINE  CONCLUSION: It is      feasible to accurately model the probability of a document being accessed in the       future based on past accesses

PMID- 21890873   - OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical relevance of medication alerts in a basic and      in an advanced clinical decision support system  CDSS   DESIGN: A prospective      observational study  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 4023 medication orders      in a hospital for independent evaluation in two pharmacotherapy-related decision       support systems  Only the more advanced system considered patient characteristics      and laboratory test results in its algorithms  Two pharmacists assessed the      clinical relevance of the medication alerts produced  The alert was considered      relevant if the pharmacist would undertake action  eg, contact the physician or     the nurse   The primary analysis concerned the positive predictive value  PPV       for clinically relevant medication alerts in both systems  RESULTS: The PPV was      significantly higher in the advanced system  5 8% vs 17 0%; p<0 05   Significant       differences were found in the alert categories: drug- drug  interaction  9 9% vs       14 8%; p<0 05 , drug-age interaction  2 9% vs 73 3%; p<0 05 , and dosing guidance       5 6% vs 16 9%; p<0 05   Including laboratory values and other patient      characteristics resulted in a significantly higher PPV for the advanced CDSS      compared to the basic medication alerts  12 2% vs 23 3%; p<0 05   CONCLUSION: The      advanced CDSS produced a higher proportion of clinically relevant medication      alerts, but the number of irrelevant alerts remained high  To improve the PPV of       the advanced CDSS, the algorithms should be optimized by identifying additional      risk modifiers and more data should be made electronically available to improve      the performance of the algorithms  Our study illustrates and corroborates the      need for cyclic testing of technical improvements in information technology in      circumstances representative of daily clinical practice

PMID- 21875867   - OBJECTIVE: Renal transplantation has dramatically improved the survival rate of      hemodialysis patients  However, with a growing proportion of marginal organs and       improved immunosuppression, it is necessary to verify that the established      allocation system, mostly based on human leukocyte antigen matching, still meets       today's needs  The authors turn to machine-learning techniques to predict, from      donor-recipient data, the estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  of the      recipient 1 year after transplantation  DESIGN: The patient's eGFR was predicted       using donor-recipient characteristics available at the time of transplantation       Donors' data were obtained from Eurotransplant's database, while recipients'      details were retrieved from Charite Campus Virchow-Klinikum's database  A total      of 707 renal transplantations from cadaveric donors were included  MEASUREMENTS:       Two separate datasets were created, taking features with <10% missing values for       one and <50% missing values for the other  Four established regressors were run      on both datasets, with and without feature selection  RESULTS: The authors      obtained a Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and real eGFR  COR        of 0 48  The best model for the dataset was a Gaussian support vector machine      with recursive feature elimination on the more inclusive dataset  All results are      available at http://transplant molgen mpg de/  LIMITATIONS: For now, missing      values in the data must be predicted and filled in  The performance is not as      high as hoped, but the dataset seems to be the main cause  CONCLUSIONS:      Predicting the outcome is possible with the dataset at hand  COR=0 48   Valuable       features include age and creatinine levels of the donor, as well as sex and      weight of the recipient

PMID- 21875866   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate practitioners' expectations of, and satisfaction with,      older and newer electronic health records  EHRs  after a transition  MATERIAL AND      METHODS: Pre- and post-transition survey administered at six academic-affiliated       ambulatory care practices from 2006 to 2008  Four practices transitioned to one      commercial EHR and two practices to another  We compared respondents'      expectations of, and satisfaction with, the newer EHR  RESULTS: 523 subjects were      eligible: 217 were available before transition and 306 after transition  162      pre-transition and 197 post-transition responses were received, yielding 75% and       64% response rates, respectively  Practitioners were more satisfied with the      newer EHRs  64%  compared with the older  56%   p=0 15  and a small majority       58%  were satisfied with the transition  Practitioners' satisfaction with the      older EHRs for completing clinical tasks was high  The newer EHRs exceeded      practitioner expectations regarding remote access  61% vs 74%; p=0 03   However,       the newer EHRs did not meet practitioners' expectations regarding their ability      to perform clinical tasks, or more globally, improve medication safety  81% vs      61%; p<0 001 , efficiency  70% vs 44%; p<0 001 , and quality of care  77% vs 67%;      p=0 04   DISCUSSION: Most practitioners had favorable opinions about EHRs and      reported overall improved satisfaction with the newer EHRs  However,      practitioners' high expectations of the newer EHRs were often unmet regarding      facilitation of specific clinical tasks or for improving quality, safety, and      efficiency  CONCLUSION: To ensure practitioners' expectations, for instance      regarding improvements in medication safety, are met, vendors should develop and       implement refinements in their software as practices upgrade to newer, certified       EHRs

PMID- 21857023   - With the proliferation of relatively mature health information technology  IT       systems with large numbers of users, it becomes increasingly important to      evaluate the effect of these systems on the quality and safety of healthcare       Previous research on the effectiveness of health IT has had mixed results, which       may be in part attributable to the evaluation frameworks used  The authors      propose a model for evaluation, the Triangle Model, developed for designing      studies of quality and safety outcomes of health IT  This model identifies      structure-level predictors, including characteristics of:  1  the technology      itself;  2  the provider using the technology;  3  the organizational setting;      and  4  the patient population  In addition, the model outlines process      predictors, including  1  usage of the technology,  2  organizational support for     and customization of the technology, and  3  organizational policies and      procedures about quality and safety  The Triangle Model specifies the variables      to be measured, but is flexible enough to accommodate both qualitative and      quantitative approaches to capturing them  The authors illustrate this model,      which integrates perspectives from both health services research and biomedical      informatics, with examples from evaluations of electronic prescribing, but it is       also applicable to a variety of types of health IT systems

PMID- 21852412   - OBJECTIVE: The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funded an evidence      report to address seven questions on multiple aspects of the effectiveness of      medication management information technology  MMIT  and its components       prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring        MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and 11 other databases without language or date      limitations to mid-2010  Randomized controlled trials  RCTs  assessing integrated      MMIT were selected by two independent reviewers  Reviewers assessed study quality      and extracted data  Senior staff checked accuracy  RESULTS: Most of the 87 RCTs      focused on clinical decision support and computerized provider order entry      systems, were performed in hospitals and clinics, included primarily physicians      and sometimes nurses but not other health professionals, and studied process      changes related to prescribing and monitoring medication  Processes of care      improved for prescribing and monitoring mostly in hospital settings, but the few       studies measuring clinical outcomes showed small or no improvements  Studies were      performed most frequently in the USA  n=63 , Europe  n=16 , and Canada  n=6        DISCUSSION: Many studies had limited description of systems, installations,      institutions, and targets of the intervention  Problems with methods and analyses      were also found  Few studies addressed order communication, dispensing, or     administering, non-physician prescribers or pharmacists and their MMIT tools, or       patients and caregivers  Other study methods are also needed to completely      understand the effects of MMIT  CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of MMIT interventions      improved the process of care, but few studies measured clinical outcomes  This      large body of literature, although instructive, is not uniformly distributed      across settings, people, medication phases, or outcomes

PMID- 21849334   - OBJECTIVE: Alerting systems, a type of clinical decision support, are      increasingly prevalent in healthcare, yet few studies have concurrently measured       the appropriateness of alerts with provider responses to alerts  Recent reports      of suboptimal alert system design and implementation highlight the need for     better evaluation to inform future designs  The authors present a comprehensive      framework for evaluating the clinical appropriateness of synchronous,      interruptive medication safety alerts  METHODS: Through literature review and      iterative testing, metrics were developed that describe successes, justifiable      overrides, provider non-adherence, and unintended adverse consequences of      clinical decision support alerts  The framework was validated by applying it to a      medication alerting system for patients with acute kidney injury  AKI   RESULTS:       Through expert review, the framework assesses each alert episode for     appropriateness of the alert display and the necessity and urgency of a clinical       response  Primary outcomes of the framework include the false positive alert      rate, alert override rate, provider non-adherence rate, and rate of provider     response appropriateness  Application of the framework to evaluate an existing      AKI medication alerting system provided a more complete understanding of the      process outcomes measured in the AKI medication alerting system  The authors      confirmed that previous alerts and provider responses were most often      appropriate  CONCLUSION: The new evaluation model offers a potentially effective       method for assessing the clinical appropriateness of synchronous interruptive      medication alerts prior to evaluating patient outcomes in a comparative trial       More work can determine the generalizability of the framework for use in other     settings and other alert types

PMID- 21849333   - Tourism as well as international business travel creates health risks for     individuals and populations both in host societies and home countries  One      strategy to reduce health-related risks to travelers is to provide travelers and       relevant caregivers timely, ongoing access to their own health information  Many       websites offer health advice for travelers  For example, the WHO and US      Department of State offer up-to-date health information about countries relevant       to travel  However, little has been done to assure travelers that their medical      information is available at the right place and time when the need might arise       Applications of Information and Communication Technology  ICT  utilizing mobile      phones for health management are promising tools both for the delivery of      healthcare services and the promotion of personal health  This paper describes      the project developed by international informaticians under the umbrella of the      International Medical Informatics Association  A template capable of becoming an       international standard is proposed  This application is available free to anyone       who is interested  Furthermore, its source code is made open

PMID- 21846780   - OBJECTIVE: Despite efforts made by ambulatory care organizations to standardize      the use of electronic health records  EHRs , practices often incorporate these      systems into their work differently from each other  One potential factor     contributing to these differences is within-practice communication patterns  The       authors explore the linkage between within-practice communication patterns and      practice-level EHR use patterns  DESIGN: Qualitative study of six practices      operating within the same multi-specialty ambulatory care organization using the       same EHR system  Semistructured interviews and direct observation were conducted       with all physicians, nurses, medical assistants, practice managers, and      non-clinical staff from each practice  MEASUREMENTS: An existing model of      practice relationships was used to analyze communication patterns within the      practices  Practice-level EHR use was defined and analyzed as the ways in which a      practice uses an EHR as a collective or a group-including the degree of feature      use, level of EHR-enabled communication, and frequency that EHR use changes in a       practice  Interview and observation data were analyzed for themes  Based on these      themes, within-practice communication patterns were categorized as fragmented or       cohesive, and practice-level EHR use patterns were categorized as heterogeneous      or homogeneous  Practices where EHR use was uniformly high across all users were       further categorized as having standardized EHR use  Communication patterns and      EHR use patterns were compared across the six practices  RESULTS: Within-practice      communication patterns were associated with practice-level EHR use patterns  In      practices where communication patterns were fragmented, EHR use was      heterogeneous  In practices where communication patterns were cohesive, EHR use      was homogeneous  Additional analysis revealed that practices that had achieved      standardized EHR use  uniformly high EHR use across all users  exhibited high      levels of mindfulness and respectful interaction, whereas practices that were      furthest from achieving standardized EHR use exhibited low levels of mindfulness       and respectful interaction  CONCLUSION: Within-practice communication patterns      provide a unique perspective for exploring the issue of standardization in EHR     use  A major fallacy of setting homogeneous EHR use as the goal for     practice-level EHR use is that practices with uniformly low EHR use could be      considered successful  Achieving uniformly high EHR use across all users in a      practice is more consistent with the goals of current EHR adoption and use      efforts  It was found that some communication patterns among practice members may      enable more standardized EHR use than others  Understanding the linkage between      communication patterns and EHR use can inform understanding of the human element       in EHR use and may provide key lessons for the implementation of EHRs and other     health information technologies

PMID- 21846779   - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of capturing the knowledge required to       create guideline recommendations in a systematic, structured, manner using a      software assistant  Practice guidelines constitute an important modality that can      reduce the delivery of inappropriate care and support the introduction of new      knowledge into clinical practice  However, many guideline recommendations are      vague and underspecified, lack any linkage to supporting evidence or     documentation of how they were developed, and prove to be difficult to transform       into systems that influence the behavior of care providers  METHODS: The      BRIDGE-Wiz application  Building Recommendations In a Developer's Guideline      Editor  uses a wizard approach to address the questions:  1  under what      circumstances?  2  who?  3  ought  with what level of obligation?   4  to do      what?  5  to whom?  6  how and why? Controlled natural language was applied to      create and populate a template for recommendation statements  RESULTS: The      application was used by five national panels to develop guidelines  In general,      panelists agreed that the software helped to formalize a process for authoring      guideline recommendations and deemed the application usable and useful       DISCUSSION: Use of BRIDGE-Wiz promotes clarity of recommendations by limiting      verb choices, building active voice recommendations, incorporating decidability      and executability checks, and limiting Boolean connectors  It enhances      transparency by incorporating systematic appraisal of evidence quality, benefits,      and harms  BRIDGE-Wiz promotes implementability by providing a pseudocode rule,      suggesting deontic modals, and limiting the use of 'consider'  CONCLUSION: Users       found that BRIDGE-Wiz facilitates the development of clear, transparent, and      implementable guideline recommendations

PMID- 21764888   - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the Canadian health information technology  HIT  policy      experience and impart lessons learned to the US as it determines its policy in      this area  DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of interviews with identified key      stakeholders followed by an electronic survey  MEASUREMENTS: We conducted      semi-structured interviews with 29 key Canadian HIT policy and opinion leaders      and used a grounded theory approach to analyze the results  The informant sample       was chosen to provide views from different stakeholder groups including national       representatives and regional representatives from three Canadian provinces       RESULTS: Canadian informants believed that much of the current US direction is      positive, especially regarding incentives and meaningful use, but that there are       key opportunities for the US to emphasize direct engagement with providers,      define a clear business case for them, sponsor large scale evaluations to assess       HIT impact in a broad array of settings, determine standards but also enable      access to resources needed for mid-course corrections of standards when issues      are identified, and, finally, leverage implementation of digital imaging systems       LIMITATIONS: Not all stakeholder groups were included, such as providers or     patients  In addition, as in all qualitative research, a selection bias could be       present due to the relatively small sample size  CONCLUSIONS: Based on Canadian      experience with HIT policy, stakeholders identified as lessons for the US the      need to increase direct engagement with providers and the importance of defining       the business case for HIT, which can be achieved through large scale evaluations,      and of recognizing and leveraging successes as they emerge

PMID- 21727204   - Cloud computing refers to subscription-based, fee-for-service utilization of      computer hardware and software over the Internet  The model is gaining acceptance      for business information technology  IT  applications because it allows capacity       and functionality to increase on the fly without major investment in      infrastructure, personnel or licensing fees  Large IT investments can be      converted to a series of smaller operating expenses  Cloud architectures could      potentially be superior to traditional electronic health record  EHR  designs in       terms of economy, efficiency and utility  A central issue for EHR developers in      the US is that these systems are constrained by federal regulatory legislation      and oversight  These laws focus on security and privacy, which are      well-recognized challenges for cloud computing systems in general  EHRs built      with the cloud computing model can achieve acceptable privacy and security      through business associate contracts with cloud providers that specify compliance      requirements, performance metrics and liability sharing

PMID- 21727203   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a population-based proband-oriented pedigree information      system that can be easily applied to various diseases in genetic epidemiological       studies, making allowance for the capture of theoretical family relationships       DESIGNS AND MEASUREMENTS: A population-based proband-oriented pedigree      information system with ties of consanguinity based on both population-based      household registry data and Keelung Community Integrated Screening data was      proposed to build a comprehensive extended family pedigree structure to      accommodate a series of genetic studies on different diseases  We also developed       an algorithm to efficiently assess how well theoretical family relationships      affecting the occurrence of diseases across three generations with respect to the      relative relationship score, a quantitative indicator of genetic influence, were       captured  RESULTS: We applied this population-based proband-oriented pedigree      information system to estimate the rate of hypertension with various relative      relationships given the selection of probands  The degree of capturing complete      familial relationships was assessed for three generations  The risk for early      onset of hypertension was proportional to the proband-oriented relative      relationship score with 2% increased risk and 1% correction for incomplete      capture  CONCLUSIONS: The population-based proband-oriented pedigree information       system is powerful and can support various genetic descriptive and analytic      epidemiological studies

PMID- 21715429   - OBJECTIVES: Studies on the impact and value of health information technology       HIT  have often focused on outcome measures that are counts of such things as      hospital admissions or the number of laboratory tests per patient  These measures      with their highly skewed distributions  high frequency of 0s and 1s  are more      appropriately analyzed with count data models than the much more frequently used       variations of ordinary least squares  OLS   Use of a statistical procedure that      does not properly fit the distribution of the data can result in significant      findings being overlooked  The objective of this paper is to encourage greater     use of count data models by demonstrating their utility with an example based on       the authors' current work  TARGET AUDIENCE: Researchers conducting impact and      outcome studies related to HIT  SCOPE: We review and discuss count data models      and illustrate their value in comparison to OLS using an example from a study of       the impact of an electronic health record  EHR  on laboratory test orders  The      best count data model reveals significant relationships that OLS does not detect       We conclude that comprehensive model checking is highly recommended to identify      the most appropriate analytic model when the dependent variable being examined      contains count data  This strategy can lead to more valid and precise findings in      HIT evaluation studies

PMID- 21685142   - Automation bias  AB --the tendency to over-rely on automation--has been studied      in various academic fields  Clinical decision support systems  CDSS  aim to      benefit the clinical decision-making process  Although most research shows      overall improved performance with use, there is often a failure to recognize the       new errors that CDSS can introduce  With a focus on healthcare, a systematic      review of the literature from a variety of research fields has been carried out,       assessing the frequency and severity of AB, the effect mediators, and      interventions potentially mitigating this effect  This is discussed alongside      automation-induced complacency, or insufficient monitoring of automation output        A mix of subject specific and freetext terms around the themes of automation,      human-automation interaction, and task performance and error were used to search       article databases  Of 13 821 retrieved papers, 74 met the inclusion criteria       User factors such as cognitive style, decision support systems  DSS , and task      specific experience mediated AB, as did attitudinal driving factors such as trust      and confidence  Environmental mediators included workload, task complexity, and      time constraint, which pressurized cognitive resources  Mitigators of AB included      implementation factors such as training and emphasizing user accountability, and       DSS design factors such as the position of advice on the screen, updated      confidence levels attached to DSS output, and the provision of information versus      recommendation  By uncovering the mechanisms by which AB operates, this review      aims to help optimize the clinical decision-making process for CDSS developers      and healthcare practitioners

PMID- 21676938   - OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug events  ADEs  are common and account for 770 000 injuries      and deaths each year and drug interactions account for as much as 30% of these      ADEs  Spontaneous reporting systems routinely collect ADEs from patients on      complex combinations of medications and provide an opportunity to discover     unexpected drug interactions  Unfortunately, current algorithms for such "signal       detection" are limited by underreporting of interactions that are not expected       We present a novel method to identify latent drug interaction signals in the case      of underreporting  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified eight clinically      significant adverse events  We used the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System to      build profiles for these adverse events based on the side effects of drugs known       to produce them  We then looked for pairs of drugs that match these single-drug      profiles in order to predict potential interactions  We evaluated these      interactions in two independent data sets and also through a retrospective      analysis of the Stanford Hospital electronic medical records  RESULTS: We      identified 171 novel drug interactions  for eight adverse event categories  that       are significantly enriched for known drug interactions  p=0 0009  and used the      electronic medical record for independently testing drug interaction hypotheses      using multivariate statistical models with covariates  CONCLUSION: Our method      provides an option for detecting hidden interactions in spontaneous reporting      systems by using side effect profiles to infer the presence of unreported adverse      events

PMID- 22180873   - Biomedical informatics is a young, highly interdisciplinary field that is      evolving quickly  It is important to know which published topics in generalist      biomedical informatics journals elicit the most interest from the scientific      community, and whether this interest changes over time, so that journals can      better serve their readers  It is also important to understand whether free      access to biomedical informatics articles impacts their citation rates in a      significant way, so authors can make informed decisions about unlock fees, and      journal owners and publishers understand the implications of open access  The      topics and JAMIA articles from years 2009 and 2010 that have been most cited      according to the Web of Science are described  To better understand the effects      of free access in article dissemination, the number of citations per month after       publication for articles published in 2009 versus 2010 was compared, since there       was a significant change in free access to JAMIA articles between those years       Results suggest that there is a positive association between free access and      citation rate for JAMIA articles

PMID- 22199017   - BackgroundElectronic health record  EHR  adoption is a national priority in the      USA, and well-designed EHRs have the potential to improve quality and safety       However, physicians are reluctant to implement EHRs due to financial constraints,      usability concerns, and apprehension about unintended consequences, including the      introduction of medical errors related to EHR use  The goal of this study was to       characterize and describe physicians' attitudes towards three consequences of EHR     implementation:  1  the potential for EHRs to introduce new errors;  2       improvements in healthcare quality; and  3  changes in overall physician      satisfaction MethodsUsing data from a 2007 statewide survey of Massachusetts      physicians, we conducted multivariate regression analysis to examine      relationships between practice characteristics, perceptions of EHR-related      errors, perceptions of healthcare quality, and overall physician      satisfaction Results30% of physicians agreed that EHRs create new opportunities      for error, but only 2% believed their EHR has created more errors than it      prevented  With respect to perceptions of quality, there was no significant      association between perceptions of EHR-associated errors and perceptions of      EHR-associated changes in healthcare quality  Finally, physicians who believed      that EHRs created new opportunities for error were less likely be satisfied with       their practice situation  adjusted OR 0 49, p=0 001  ConclusionsAlmost one third       of physicians perceived that EHRs create new opportunities for error  This      perception was associated with lower levels of physician satisfaction

PMID- 22190040   - OBJECTIVE: A complex disease is generally caused by the mutation of multiple      genes or by the dysfunction of multiple biological processes  Systematic      identification of causal disease genes and module biomarkers can provide insights      into the mechanisms underlying complex diseases, and help develop efficient      therapies or effective drugs  MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we present a       novel approach to predict disease genes and identify dysfunctional networks or     modules, based on the analysis of differential interactions between disease and      control samples, in contrast to the analysis of differential gene or protein      expressions widely adopted in existing methods  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As an      example, we applied our method to the study of three-stage microarray data for     gastric cancer  We identified network modules or module biomarkers that include a      set of genes related to gastric cancer, implying the predictive power of our     method  The results on holdout validation data sets show that our identified      module can serve as an effective module biomarker for accurately detecting or     diagnosing gastric cancer, thereby validating the efficiency of our method       CONCLUSION: We proposed a new approach to detect module biomarkers for diseases,       and the results on gastric cancer demonstrated that the differential interactions      are useful to detect dysfunctional modules in the molecular interaction network,       which in turn can be used as robust module biomarkers

PMID- 22180871   - The Arden Syntax is an HL7 standard language for representing medical knowledge      as logic statements  Despite nearly 2 decades of availability, Arden Syntax has      not been widely used  This has been attributed to the lack of a generally      available compiler to implement the logic, to Arden's complex syntax, to the      challenges of mapping local data to data references in the Medical Logic Modules        MLMs , or, more globally, to the general absence of decision support in      healthcare computing  An XML representation  ArdenML  may partially address the      technical challenges  MLMs created in ArdenML can be converted into executable      files using standard transforms written in the Extensible Stylesheet Language      Transformation  XSLT  language  As an example, we have demonstrated an approach      to executing MLMs written in ArdenML using the Drools business rule management      system  Extensions to ArdenML make it possible to generate a user interface      through which an MLM developer can test for logical errors

PMID- 22140209   - ObjectiveLittle is known about the frequency and types of prescribing errors in      the ambulatory setting among community-based, primary care providers  Therefore,       the rates and types of prescribing errors were assessed among community-based,      primary care providers in two states Material and MethodsA non-randomized      cross-sectional study was conducted of 48 providers in New York and 30 providers       in Massachusetts, all of whom used paper prescriptions, from September 2005 to      November 2006  Using standardized methodology, prescriptions and medical records       were reviewed to identify errors Results9385 prescriptions were analyzed from      5955 patients  The overall prescribing error rate, excluding illegibility errors,      was 36 7 per 100 prescriptions  95% CI 30 7 to 44 0  and did not vary      significantly between providers from each state  p=0 39   One or more      non-illegibility errors were found in 28% of prescriptions  Rates of illegibility      errors were very high  175 0 per 100 prescriptions, 95% CI 169 1 to 181 3        Inappropriate abbreviation and direction errors also occurred frequently  13 4      and 4 2 errors per 100 prescriptions, respectively   Reviewers determined that      the vast majority of errors could have been eliminated through the use of      e-prescribing with clinical decision support DiscussionPrescribing errors appear       to occur at very high rates among community-based primary care providers,      especially when compared with studies of academic-affiliated providers that have       found nearly threefold lower error rates  Illegibility errors are particularly      problematical ConclusionsFurther characterizing prescribing errors of      community-based providers may inform strategies to improve ambulatory medication       safety, especially e-prescribing Trial registration      numberhttp://www clinicaltrials gov, NCT00225576

PMID- 22120207   - It is becoming increasingly apparent that there is a tension between growing      consumer demands for access to information and a healthcare system that may not      be prepared to meet these demands  Designing an effective solution for this      problem will require a thorough understanding of the barriers that now stand in      the way of giving patients electronic access to their health data  This paper     reviews the following challenges related to the sharing of electronic health      records: cost and security concerns, problems in assigning responsibilities and      rights among the various players, liability issues and tensions between flexible       access to data and flexible access to physicians

PMID- 22116643   - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that a large, heterogeneous clinical database can      reveal fine temporal patterns in clinical associations; to illustrate several      types of associations; and to ascertain the value of exploiting time  MATERIALS      AND METHODS: Lagged linear correlation was calculated between seven clinical      laboratory values and 30 clinical concepts extracted from resident signout notes       from a 22-year, 3-million-patient database of electronic health records  Time      points were interpolated, and patients were normalized to reduce inter-patient      effects  RESULTS: The method revealed several types of associations with detailed      temporal patterns  Definitional associations included low blood potassium      preceding 'hypokalemia ' Low potassium preceding the drug spironolactone with      high potassium following spironolactone exemplified intentional and physiologic      associations, respectively  Counterintuitive results such as the fact that      diseases appeared to follow their effects may be due to the workflow of      healthcare, in which clinical findings precede the clinician's diagnosis of a      disease even though the disease actually preceded the findings  Fully exploiting       time by interpolating time points produced less noisy results  DISCUSSION:      Electronic health records are not direct reflections of the patient state, but      rather reflections of the healthcare process and the recording process  With      proper techniques and understanding, and with proper incorporation of time,      interpretable associations can be derived from a large clinical database       CONCLUSION: A large, heterogeneous clinical database can reveal clinical      associations, time is an important feature, and care must be taken to interpret      the results

PMID- 22116642   - Over the next 10 years, more information and communication technology  ICT  will       be deployed in the health system than in its entire previous history  Systems      will be larger in scope, more complex, and move from regional to national and      supranational scale  Yet we are at roughly the same place the aviation industry      was in the 1950s with respect to system safety  Even if ICT harm rates do not      increase, increased ICT use will increase the absolute number of ICT related      harms  Factors that could diminish ICT harm include adoption of common standards,      technology maturity, better system development, testing, implementation and end      user training  Factors that will increase harm rates include complexity and      heterogeneity of systems and their interfaces, rapid implementation and poor     training of users  Mitigating these harms will not be easy, as organizational      inertia is likely to generate a hysteresis-like lag, where the paths to increase       and decrease harm are not identical

PMID- 22101970   - OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies  GWAS  require high specificity and      large numbers of subjects to identify genotype-phenotype correlations accurately       The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes  T2D  cases and controls      for a GWAS, using data captured through routine clinical care across five      institutions using different electronic medical record  EMR  systems  MATERIALS      AND METHODS: An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based       on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results  The      performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating      institutions compared against clinician review  A GWAS was subsequently performed      using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across       all five institutions  RESULTS: The algorithm achieved 98% and 100% positive      predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls,      respectively, as compared against clinician review  By standardizing and applying      the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified        Subsequent GWAS using data from five institutions replicated the TCF7L2 gene      variant  rs7903146  previously associated with T2D  DISCUSSION: By applying      stringent criteria to EMR data collected through routine clinical care, cases and      controls for a GWAS were identified that subsequently replicated a known genetic       variant  The use of standard terminologies to define data elements enabled      pooling of subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the      robust numbers required for GWAS  CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm using commonly      available data from five different EMR can accurately identify T2D cases and      controls for genetic study across multiple institutions

PMID- 22101969   - BackgroundWe sought to measure population-level adherence to antihyperlipidemics,      antihypertensives, and oral hypoglycemics, and to develop a model for early      identification of subjects at high risk of long-term poor     adherence MethodsPrescription-filling data for 2 million subjects derived from a       payor's insurance claims were used to evaluate adherence to three chronic drugs      over 1 year  We relied on patterns of prescription fills, including the length of      gaps in medication possession, to measure adherence among subjects and to build      models for predicting poor long-term adherence ResultsAll prescription fills for       a specific drug were sequenced chronologically into drug eras  61 3% to 66 5% of       the prescription patterns contained medication gaps >30 days during the first      year of drug use  These interrupted drug eras include long-term discontinuations,      where the subject never again filled a prescription for any drug in that category      in the dataset, which represent 23 7% to 29 1% of all drug eras  Among the      prescription-filling patterns without large medication gaps, 0 8% to 1 3%      exhibited long-term poor adherence  Our models identified these subjects as early      as 60 days after the first prescription fill, with an area under the curve  AUC        of 0 81  Model performance improved as the predictions were made at later     time-points, with AUC values increasing to 0 93 at the 120-day      time-point ConclusionsDispensed medication histories  widely available in real      time  are useful for alerting providers about poorly adherent patients and those       who will be non-adherent several months later  Efforts to use these data in point      of care and decision support facilitating patient are warranted

PMID- 22101907   - OBJECTIVE: A core feature of e-prescribing is the electronic exchange of      prescription data between physician practices and pharmacies, which can      potentially improve the efficiency of the prescribing process and reduce      medication errors  Barriers to implementing this feature exist, but they are not       well understood  This study's objectives were to explore recent physician      practice and pharmacy experiences with electronic transmission of new      prescriptions and renewals, and identify facilitators of and barriers to      effective electronic transmission and pharmacy e-prescription processing  DESIGN:      Qualitative analysis of 114 telephone interviews conducted with representatives      from 97 organizations between February and September 2010, including 24 physician      practices, 48 community pharmacies, and three mail-order pharmacies actively      transmitting or receiving e-prescriptions via Surescripts  RESULTS: Practices and      pharmacies generally were satisfied with electronic transmission of new      prescriptions but reported that the electronic renewal process was used      inconsistently, resulting in inefficient workarounds for both parties  Practice      communications with mail-order pharmacies were less likely to be electronic than       with community pharmacies because of underlying transmission network and computer     system limitations  While e-prescribing reduced manual prescription entry,      pharmacy staff frequently had to complete or edit certain fields, particularly      drug name and patient instructions  CONCLUSIONS: Electronic transmission of new      prescriptions has matured  Changes in technical standards and system design and      more targeted physician and pharmacy training may be needed to address barriers      to e-renewals, mail-order pharmacy connectivity, and pharmacy processing of      e-prescriptions

PMID- 22101906   - In a randomized trial of a clinical decision support system for drug prescribing       for residents with renal insufficiency in a large long-term care facility,      analyses were conducted to estimate the system's immediate, direct financial      impact  We determined the costs that would have been incurred if drug orders that      triggered the alert system had actually been completed compared to the costs of      the final submitted orders and then compared intervention units to control units       The costs incurred by additional laboratory testing that resulted from alerts      were also estimated  Drug orders were conservatively assigned a duration of 30      days of use for a chronic drug and 10 days for antibiotics  It was determined      that there were modest reductions in drug costs, partially offset by an increase       in laboratory-related costs  Overall, there was a reduction in direct costs       US$1391 43, net 7 6% reduction   However, sensitivity analyses based on      alternative estimates of duration of drug use suggested a reduction as high as      US$7998 33 if orders for non-antibiotic drugs were assumed to be continued for     180 days  The authors conclude that the immediate and direct financial impact of       a clinical decision support system for medication ordering for residents with      renal insufficiency is modest and that the primary motivation for such efforts      must be to improve the quality and safety of medication ordering

PMID- 22101905   - MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and       each regulate their own transcription and that of hundreds of genes, often in a      tissue-dependent manner  This creates a tightly interwoven network regulating and      underlying oncogenesis and cancer biology  Although protein-coding gene      signatures and single protein pathway markers have proliferated over the past      decade, routine adoption of the former has been hampered by interpretability,      reproducibility, and dimensionality, whereas the single molecule-phenotype      reductionism of the latter is often overly simplistic to account for complex      phenotypes  MicroRNA-derived biomarkers offer a powerful alternative; they have      both the flexibility of gene expression signature classifiers and the desirable      mechanistic transparency of single protein biomarkers  Furthermore, several      advances have recently demonstrated the robust detection of microRNAs from      various biofluids, thus providing an additional opportunity for obtaining      bioinformatically derived biomarkers to accelerate the identification of      individual patients for personalized therapy

PMID- 22084201   - The identification and grading of adverse events  AEs  during the conduct of      clinical trials is a labor-intensive and error-prone process  This paper     describes and evaluates a software tool developed by City of Hope to automate      complex algorithms to assess laboratory results and identify and grade AEs  We      compared AEs identified by the automated system with those previously assessed      manually, to evaluate missed/misgraded AEs  We also conducted a prospective      paired time assessment of automated versus manual AE assessment  We found a      substantial improvement in accuracy/completeness with the automated grading tool,      which identified an additional 17% of severe grade 3-4 AEs that had been      missed/misgraded manually  The automated system also provided an average time      saving of 5 5 min per treatment course  With 400 ongoing treatment trials at City      of Hope and an average of 1800 laboratory results requiring assessment per study,      the implications of these findings for patient safety are enormous

PMID- 22081222   - Physics-based simulation provides a powerful framework for understanding      biological form and function  Simulations can be used by biologists to study      macromolecular assemblies and by clinicians to design treatments for diseases       Simulations help biomedical researchers understand the physical constraints on      biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, synthetic tissues, medical      devices, and surgical interventions  Although individual biomedical investigators      make outstanding contributions to physics-based simulation, the field has been      fragmented  Applications are typically limited to a single physical scale, and      individual investigators usually must create their own software  These conditions      created a major barrier to advancing simulation capabilities  In 2004, we      established a National Center for Physics-Based Simulation of Biological      Structures  Simbios  to help integrate the field and accelerate biomedical      research  In 6 years, Simbios has become a vibrant national center, with      collaborators in 16 states and eight countries  Simbios focuses on problems at      both the molecular scale and the organismal level, with a long-term goal of      uniting these in accurate multiscale simulations

PMID- 22071530   - BACKGROUND: Previous studies of patient portals have found low rates of      enrollment and significant disparities in enrollment by race and ethnicity  As      the reasons for these findings are unclear, we sought to identify patient      reported barriers to enrollment in a patient portal  METHODS: We conducted a      telephone survey of patients in one urban general internal medicine clinic       Patients were eligible if they did not enroll within 30 days of receiving an      electronic order inviting participation  Our primary outcomes were:  a  reasons      for not enrolling in the patient portal;  b  reasons for not attempting      enrollment; and  c  perceived benefits of the portal  RESULTS: Participants'       N=159  mean age was 51 years, 48% were black, 72% female, and 70% had a college       degree or greater  63% of respondents not enrolling reported never attempting      enrollment despite remembering receiving an order  Most of these 63% did not      attempt enrollment because of lack of information or motivation  Smaller     proportions reported not attempting enrollment because of negative attitudes      toward the portal  30%  or computer related obstacles  8%   Overall, respondents       favorably viewed most patient portal features, however black respondents were      less likely than white respondents to consider features assisting self-management      such as getting test results  69% vs 86%; p<0 05  as important  Adjusting for     age, gender, education, and chronic disease did not substantially change results       CONCLUSION: Strategies to increase enrollment in patient portals need to ensure      patients understand patient portal features and receive follow-up reminders       Interventions to reduce racial disparities in enrollment must address attitudinal      barriers and not focus solely on improving access

PMID- 22071529   - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a rule-based algorithm applied to an outpatient       electronic medical record  EMR  can identify patients who are pregnant and      prescribed medications proved to cause birth defects  DESIGN: A descriptive study      using the University of Pennsylvania Health System outpatient EMR to simulate a      prospective algorithm to identify exposures during pregnancy to category X      medications, soon enough to intervene and potentially prevent the exposure  A      subsequent post-hoc algorithm was also tested, working backwards from pregnancy      endpoints, to search for possible exposures that should have been detected       MEASUREMENTS: Category X medications prescribed to pregnant patients  RESULTS:      The alert simulation identified 2201 pregnancies with 16,969 pregnancy months       excluding abortions and ectopic pregnancies   Of these, 30 appeared to have an      order for a non-hormone category X medication during pregnancy  However, none of       the 30 'exposed pregnancies' were confirmed as true exposures in medical records       review  The post-hoc algorithm identified 5841 pregnancies with 64 exposed      pregnancies in 52,569 risk months, only one of which was a confirmed case       CONCLUSIONS: Category X medications may indeed be used in pregnancy, although      rarely  However, most patients identified by the algorithm as exposed in      pregnancy were not truly exposed  Therefore, implementing an electronic warning      without evaluation would have inconvenienced prescribers, possibly hurting some      patients  leading to non-use of needed drugs , with no benefit  These data      demonstrate that computerized physician order entry interventions should be      selected and evaluated carefully even before their use, using alert simulations      such as that performed here, rather than just taken off the shelf and accepted as      credible without formal evaluation

PMID- 22058169   - OBJECTIVE: To examine the financial impact health information exchange  HIE  in      emergency departments  EDs   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied all ED encounters       over a 13-month period in which HIE data were accessed in all major emergency      departments Memphis, Tennessee  HIE access encounter records were matched with      similar encounter records without HIE access  Outcomes studied were ED-originated      hospital admissions, admissions for observation, laboratory testing, head CT,      body CT, ankle radiographs, chest radiographs, and echocardiograms  Our estimates      employed generalized estimating equations for logistic regression models adjusted      for admission type, length of stay, and Charlson co-morbidity index  Marginal      probabilities were used to calculate changes in outcome variables and their     financial consequences  RESULTS: HIE data were accessed in approximately 6 8% of       ED visits across 12 EDs studied  In 11 EDs directly accessing HIE data only      through a secure Web browser, access was associated with a decrease in hospital      admissions  adjusted odds ratio  OR =0 27; p<0001   In a 12th ED relying more on       print summaries, HIE access was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions       OR=0 48; p<0001  and statistically significant decreases in head CT use, body CT      use, and laboratory test ordering  DISCUSSION: Applied only to the study      population, HIE access was associated with an annual cost savings of $1 9      million  Net of annual operating costs, HIE access reduced overall costs by $1 07      million  Hospital admission reductions accounted for 97 6% of total cost      reductions  CONCLUSION: Access to additional clinical data through HIE in      emergency department settings is associated with net societal saving

PMID- 22052900   - BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems  CDSSs  are believed to enhance      patient care and reduce healthcare costs; however the current evidence is limited      and the cost-effectiveness remains unknown  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term       cost-effectiveness of a CDSS linked to evidence-based treatment recommendations      for type 2 diabetes  METHODS: Using the Ontario Diabetes Economic Model, changes       in factors  eg, HbA1c  from a randomized controlled trial were used to estimate      cost-effectiveness  The cost of implementation, development, and maintenance of      the core dataset, and projected diabetes-related complications were included  The      base case assumed a 1-year treatment effect, 5% discount rate, and 40-year time      horizon  Univariate, one-way sensitivity analyses were carried out by altering      different parameter values  The perspective was the Ontario Ministry of Health      and costs were in 2010 Canadian dollars  RESULTS: The cost of implementing the      intervention was $483,699  The one-year intervention reduced HbA1c by 0 2 and      systolic blood pressure by 3 95 mm Hg, but increased body mass index by 0 02      kg/m 2 , resulting in a relative risk reduction of 14% in the occurrence of      amputation  The model estimated that the intervention resulted in an additional      0 0117 quality-adjusted life year; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was      $160,845 per quality-adjusted life-year  CONCLUSION: The web-based prototype      decision support system slightly improved short-term risk factors  The model      predicted moderate improvements in long-term health outcomes  This disease      management program will need to develop considerable efficiencies in terms of      costs and processes or improved effectiveness to be considered a cost-effective      intervention for treating patients with type 2 diabetes

PMID- 22052898   - BACKGROUND: There are several challenges in encoding guideline knowledge in a      form that is portable to different clinical sites, including the heterogeneity of      clinical decision support  CDS  tools, of patient data representations, and of      workflows  METHODS: We have developed a multi-layered knowledge representation      framework for structuring guideline recommendations for implementation in a      variety of CDS contexts  In this framework, guideline recommendations are      increasingly structured through four layers, successively transforming a      narrative text recommendation into input for a CDS system  We have used this      framework to implement rules for a CDS service based on three guidelines  We also      conducted a preliminary evaluation, where we asked CDS experts at four     institutions to rate the implementability of six recommendations from the three      guidelines  CONCLUSION: The experience in using the framework and the preliminary      evaluation indicate that this approach has promise in creating structured      knowledge, to implement in CDS systems, that is usable across organizations

PMID- 22052897   - Implementing electronic health records  EHR  in healthcare settings incurs      challenges, none more important than maintaining efficiency and safety during      rollout  This report quantifies the impact of offloading low-acuity visits to an       alternative care site from the emergency department  ED  during EHR     implementation  In addition, the report evaluated the effect of EHR     implementation on overall patient length of stay  LOS , time to medical provider,      and provider productivity during implementation of the EHR  Overall LOS and time       to doctor increased during EHR implementation  On average, admitted patients' LOS      was 6-20% longer  For discharged patients, LOS was 12-22% longer  Attempts to      reduce patient volumes by diverting patients to another clinic were not effective      in minimizing delays in care during this EHR implementation  Delays in ED      throughput during EHR implementation are real and significant despite additional       providers in the ED, and in this setting resolved by 3 months      post-implementation

PMID- 22037893   - OBJECTIVE: Systematic analysis of observational medical databases for active      safety surveillance is hindered by the variation in data models and coding      systems  Data analysts often find robust clinical data models difficult to      understand and ill suited to support their analytic approaches  Further, some      models do not facilitate the computations required for systematic analysis across      many interventions and outcomes for large datasets  Translating the data from      these idiosyncratic data models to a common data model  CDM  could facilitate      both the analysts' understanding and the suitability for large-scale systematic      analysis  In addition to facilitating analysis, a suitable CDM has to faithfully       represent the source observational database  Before beginning to use the      Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership  OMOP  CDM and a related dictionary of      standardized terminologies for a study of large-scale systematic active safety      surveillance, the authors validated the model's suitability for this use by      example  VALIDATION BY EXAMPLE: To validate the OMOP CDM, the model was      instantiated into a relational database, data from 10 different observational      healthcare databases were loaded into separate instances, a comprehensive array      of analytic methods that operate on the data model was created, and these methods      were executed against the databases to measure performance  CONCLUSION: There was      acceptable representation of the data from 10 observational databases in the OMOP      CDM using the standardized terminologies selected, and a range of analytic      methods was developed and executed with sufficient performance to be useful for     active safety surveillance

PMID- 22037892   - The rapid advance of gene sequencing technologies has produced an unprecedented      rate of discovery of genome variation in humans  A growing number of      authoritative clinical repositories archive gene variants and disease phenotypes,      yet there are currently many more gene variants that lack clear annotation or     disease association  To date, there has been very limited coverage of      gene-specific predictors in the literature  Here the evaluation is presented of      "gene-specific" predictor models based on a naive Bayesian classifier for 20      gene-disease datasets, containing 3986 variants with clinically characterized      patient conditions  The utility of gene-specific prediction is then compared with      "all-gene" generalized prediction and also with existing popular predictors       Gene-specific computational prediction models derived from clinically curated      gene variant disease datasets often outperform established generalized algorithms      for novel and uncertain gene variants

PMID- 22037891   - Louisiana is severely affected by HIV/AIDS, ranking fifth in AIDS rates in the      USA  The Louisiana Public Health Information Exchange  LaPHIE  is a novel, secure      bi-directional public health information exchange, linking statewide public      health surveillance data with electronic medical record data  LaPHIE alerts      medical providers when individuals with HIV/AIDS who have not received HIV care      for >12 months are seen at any ambulatory or inpatient facility in an integrated       delivery network  Between 2/1/2009 and 1/31/2011, 488 alerts identified 345 HIV      positive patients  Of those identified, 82% had at least one CD4 or HIV viral      load test over the study follow-up period  LaPHIE is an innovative use of health       information exchange based on surveillance data and real time clinical messaging,      facilitating rapid provider notification of those in need of treatment  LaPHIE      successfully reduces critical missed opportunities to intervene with individuals       not in care, leveraging information historically collected solely for public      health purposes, not health care delivery, to improve public health

PMID- 22037890   - Research-networking tools use data-mining and social networking to enable      expertise discovery, matchmaking and collaboration, which are important facets of      team science and translational research  Several commercial and academic      platforms have been built, and many institutions have deployed these products to       help their investigators find local collaborators  Recent studies, though, have      shown the growing importance of multiuniversity teams in science  Unfortunately,       the lack of a standard data-exchange model and resistance of universities to      share information about their faculty have presented barriers to forming an      institutionally supported national network  This case report describes an      initiative, which, in only 6 months, achieved interoperability among seven major       research-networking products at 28 universities by taking an approach that      focused on addressing institutional concerns and encouraging their participation       With this necessary groundwork in place, the second phase of this effort can      begin, which will expand the network's functionality and focus on the end users

PMID- 22037887   - While much attention has been paid to the short-term impact that widespread      adoption of health information technology  health IT  will have on the healthcare      system, there is a corresponding need to look at the long-term effects that      extant policies may have on health IT system resilience, innovation, and related       ethical, social/legal issues  The American Medical Informatics Association's 2010      Health Policy Conference was convened to further the national discourse on the      issues surrounding these longer-term considerations  Conference participants      self-selected into three broad categories: resilience in healthcare and health      IT; ethical, legal, and social challenges; and innovation, adoption, and      sustainability  The discussions about problem areas lead to findings focusing on       the lack of encouragement for long-term IT innovation that may result from      current health IT policies; the potential impact of uneven adoption of health IT       based on the exclusions of the current financial incentives; the weaknesses of      contingency and risk mitigation planning that threaten system resilience; and      evolving standards developed in response to challenges relating to the security,       integrity, and availability of electronic health information  This paper     discusses these findings and also offers recommendations that address the      interwoven topics of innovation, resilience, and adoption  The goal of this paper     is to encourage public and private sector organizations that have a role in      shaping health information policy to increase attention to developing a national       strategy that assures that health IT innovation and resilience are not impeded by      shorter-term efforts to implement current approaches emphasizing adoption and      meaningful use of electronic health records

PMID- 22003173   - IntroductionSystematic approaches to dealing with missing values in record      linkage are still lacking  This article compares the ad-hoc treatment of unknown       comparison values as 'unequal' with other and more sophisticated approaches  An      empirical evaluation was conducted of the methods on real-world data as well as      on simulated data based on them Material and MethodsCancer registry data and      artificial data with increased numbers of missing values in a relevant variable      are used for empirical comparisons  As a classification method, classification      and regression trees were used  On the resulting binary comparison patterns, the       following strategies for dealing with missingness are considered: imputation with      unique values, sample-based imputation, reduced-model classification and      complete-case induction  These approaches are evaluated according to the number     of training data needed for induction and the F-scores achieved ResultsThe      evaluations reveal that unique value imputation leads to the best results       Imputation with zero is preferred to imputation with 0 5, although the latter     shows the highest median F-scores  Imputation with zero needs considerably less      training data, it shows only slightly worse results and simplifies the      computation by maintaining the binary structure of the data ConclusionsThe      results support the ad-hoc solution for missing values 'replace NA by the value      of inequality'  This conclusion is based on a limited amount of data and on a      specific deduplication method  Nevertheless, the authors are confident that their     results should be confirmed by other empirical analyses and applications

PMID- 22003156   - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of how      a health information exchange  HIE  fits into clinical workflow at multiple      clinical sites  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethnographic qualitative study was      conducted over a 9-month period in six emergency departments  ED  and eight      ambulatory clinics in Memphis, Tennessee, USA  Data were collected using direct      observation, informal interviews during observation, and formal semi-structured      interviews  The authors observed for over 180 h, during which providers used the       exchange 130 times  RESULTS: HIE-related workflow was modeled for each ED site      and ambulatory clinic group and substantial site-to-site workflow differences      were identified  Common patterns in HIE-related workflow were also identified      across all sites, leading to the development of two role-based workflow models:      nurse based and physician based  The workflow elements framework was applied to      the two role-based patterns  An in-depth description was developed of how      providers integrated HIE into existing clinical workflow, including prompts for     HIE use  DISCUSSION: Workflow differed substantially among sites, but two general      role-based HIE usage models were identified  Although providers used HIE to      improve continuity of patient care, patient-provider trust played a significant      role  Types of information retrieved related to roles, with nurses seeking to      retrieve recent hospitalization data and more open-ended usage by nurse      practitioners and physicians  User and role-specific customization to accommodate      differences in workflow and information needs may increase the adoption and use      of HIE  CONCLUSION: Understanding end users' perspectives towards HIE technology       is crucial to the long-term success of HIE  By applying qualitative methods, an      in-depth understanding of HIE usage was developed

PMID- 21984604   - In order to create user-centered design information to guide the development of      personal health records  PHRs , 24 patients participated in usability assessments      of VA's MyHealtheVet program  Observational videos and efficiency measures were      collected among users performing four PHR scenarios: registration and log-in,      prescription refill, tracking health, and searching for health information       Twenty-five percent of users successfully completed registration  Individuals      preferred prescription numbers over names, sometimes due to privacy concerns       Only efficiency in prescription refills was significantly better than target      values  Users wanted to print their information to share with their doctors, and       questioned the value of MyHealtheVet search functions over existing online health      information  In summary, PHR registration must balance simplicity and security,      usability tests guide how PHRs can tailor functions to individual preferences,      PHRs add value to users' data by making information more accessible and      understandable, and healthcare organizations should build trust for PHR health      content

PMID- 21984590   - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and synthesis of the evidence      surrounding the cost-effectiveness of health information technology  HIT  in the       medication process  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peer-reviewed electronic databases and      gray literature were searched to identify studies on HIT used to assist in the      medication management process  Articles including an economic component were      reviewed for further screening  For this review, full cost-effectiveness      analyses, cost-utility analyses and cost-benefit analyses, as well as cost      analyses, were eligible for inclusion and synthesis  RESULTS: The 31 studies      included were heterogeneous with respect to the HIT evaluated, setting, and      economic methods used  Thus the data could not be synthesized, and a narrative      review was conducted  Most studies evaluated computer decision support systems in      hospital settings in the USA, and only five of the studied performed full      economic evaluations  DISCUSSION: Most studies merely provided cost data;      however, useful economic data involves far more input  A full economic evaluation      includes a full enumeration of the costs, synthesized with the outcomes of the      intervention  CONCLUSION: The quality of the economic literature in this area is       poor  A few studies found that HIT may offer cost advantages despite their     increased acquisition costs  However, given the uncertainty that surrounds the      costs and outcomes data, and limited study designs, it is difficult to reach any       definitive conclusion as to whether the additional costs and benefits represent      value for money  Sophisticated concurrent prospective economic evaluations need      to be conducted to address whether HIT interventions in the medication management      process are cost-effective

PMID- 21984588   - BACKGROUND: The re-use of patient data from electronic healthcare record systems       can provide tremendous benefits for clinical research, but measures to protect      patient privacy while utilizing these records have many challenges  Some of these      challenges arise from a misperception that the problem should be solved      technically when actually the problem needs a holistic solution  OBJECTIVE: The      authors' experience with informatics for integrating biology and the bedside       i2b2  use cases indicates that the privacy of the patient should be considered      on three fronts: technical de-identification of the data, trust in the researcher     and the research, and the security of the underlying technical platforms       METHODS: The security structure of i2b2 is implemented based on consideration of       all three fronts  It has been supported with several use cases across the USA,      resulting in five privacy categories of users that serve to protect the data      while supporting the use cases  RESULTS: The i2b2 architecture is designed to      provide consistency and faithfully implement these user privacy categories  These      privacy categories help reflect the policy of both the Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act and the provisions of the National Research      Act of 1974, as embodied by current institutional review boards  CONCLUSION: By      implementing a holistic approach to patient privacy solutions, i2b2 is able to      help close the gap between principle and practice

PMID- 21984587   - OBJECTIVE: Predictive models that generate individualized estimates for medically      relevant outcomes are playing increasing roles in clinical care and translational      research  However, current methods for calibrating these estimates lose valuable       information  Our goal is to develop a new calibration method to conserve as much       information as possible, and would compare favorably to existing methods in terms      of important performance measures: discrimination and calibration  MATERIAL AND      METHODS: We propose an adaptive technique that utilizes individualized confidence      intervals  CIs  to calibrate predictions  We evaluate this new method, adaptive      calibration of predictions  ACP , in artificial and real-world medical      classification problems, in terms of areas under the ROC curves, the      Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, mean squared error, and computational      complexity  RESULTS: ACP compared favorably to other calibration methods such as       binning, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression  In several experiments, binning,      isotonic regression, and Platt scaling failed to improve the calibration of a      logistic regression model, whereas ACP consistently improved the calibration      while maintaining the same discrimination or even improving it in some      experiments  In addition, the ACP algorithm is not computationally expensive       LIMITATIONS: The calculation of CIs for individual predictions may be cumbersome       for certain predictive models  ACP is not completely parameter-free: the length      of the CI employed may affect its results  CONCLUSIONS: ACP can generate      estimates that may be more suitable for individualized predictions than estimates      that are calibrated using existing methods  Further studies are necessary to      explore the limitations of ACP

PMID- 21976027   - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the web structure of two web-based continuing education      courses, identify problems and assess the effects of web site modifications       DESIGN: Markov chain models were built from 2008 web usage data to evaluate the      courses' web structure and navigation patterns  The web site was then modified to      resolve identified design issues and the improvement in user activity over the      subsequent 12 months was quantitatively evaluated  MEASUREMENTS: Web navigation      paths were collected between 2008 and 2010  The probability of navigating from      one web page to another was analyzed  RESULTS: The continuing education courses'       sequential structure design was clearly reflected in the resulting actual web      usage models, and none of the skip transitions provided was heavily used  The web      navigation patterns of the two different continuing education courses were      similar  Two possible design flaws were identified and fixed in only one of the      two courses  Over the following 12 months, the drop-out rate in the modified      course significantly decreased from 41% to 35%, but remained unchanged in the      unmodified course  The web improvement effects were further verified via a      second-order Markov chain model  CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that differences       in web content have less impact than web structure design on how learners      navigate through continuing education courses  Evaluation of user navigation can       help identify web design flaws and guide modifications  This study showed that      Markov chain models provide a valuable tool to evaluate web-based education      courses  Both the results and techniques in this study would be very useful for     public health education and research specialists

PMID- 21946242   - OBJECTIVE: To extract physician-asserted drug side effects from electronic      medical record clinical narratives  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pattern matching rules      were manually developed through examining keywords and expression patterns of      side effects to discover an individual side effect and causative drug      relationship  A combination of machine learning  C4 5  using side effect keyword       features and pattern matching rules was used to extract sentences that contain      side effect and causative drug pairs, enabling the system to discover most side      effect occurrences  Our system was implemented as a module within the clinical      Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System  RESULTS: The system was tested in       the domain of psychiatry and psychology  The rule-based system extracting side      effects and causative drugs produced an F score of 0 80  0 55 excluding allergy      section   The hybrid system identifying side effect sentences had an F score of      0 75  0 56 excluding allergy section  but covered more side effect and causative       drug pairs than individual side effect extraction  DISCUSSION: The rule-based      system was able to identify most side effects expressed by clear indication      words  More sophisticated semantic processing is required to handle complex side       effect descriptions in the narrative  We demonstrated that our system can be      trained to identify sentences with complex side effect descriptions that can be      submitted to a human expert for further abstraction  CONCLUSION: Our system was      able to extract most physician-asserted drug side effects  It can be used in      either an automated mode for side effect extraction or semi-automated mode to      identify side effect sentences that can significantly simplify abstraction by a      human expert

PMID- 21946241   - BACKGROUND: Medication-related decision support can reduce the frequency of      preventable adverse drug events  However, the design of current medication alerts      often results in alert fatigue and high over-ride rates, thus reducing any      potential benefits  METHODS: The authors previously reviewed human-factors      principles for relevance to medication-related decision support alerts  In this      study, instrument items were developed for assessing the appropriate      implementation of these human-factors principles in drug-drug interaction  DDI       alerts  User feedback regarding nine electronic medical records was considered      during the development process  Content validity, construct validity through      correlation analysis, and inter-rater reliability were assessed  RESULTS: The      final version of the instrument included 26 items associated with nine      human-factors principles  Content validation on three systems resulted in the      addition of one principle  Corrective Actions  to the instrument and the      elimination of eight items  Additionally, the wording of eight items was altered       Correlation analysis suggests a direct relationship between system age and      performance of DDI alerts  p=0 0016   Inter-rater reliability indicated      substantial agreement between raters  kappa=0 764   CONCLUSION: The authors      developed and gathered preliminary evidence for the validity of an instrument      that measures the appropriate use of human-factors principles in the design and      display of DDI alerts  Designers of DDI alerts may use the instrument to improve       usability and increase user acceptance of medication alerts, and organizations      selecting an electronic medical record may find the instrument helpful in meeting      their clinicians' usability needs

PMID- 21946240   - OBJECTIVE: The quality of colonoscopy procedures for colorectal cancer screening       is often inadequate and varies widely among physicians  Routine measurement of      quality is limited by the costs of manual review of free-text patient charts  Our     goal was to develop a natural language processing  NLP  application to measure      colonoscopy quality  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a set of quality measures      published by physician specialty societies, we implemented an NLP engine that      extracts 21 variables for 19 quality measures from free-text colonoscopy and      pathology reports  We evaluated the performance of the NLP engine on a test set      of 453 colonoscopy reports and 226 pathology reports, considering accuracy in      extracting the values of the target variables from text, and the reliability of      the outcomes of the quality measures as computed from the NLP-extracted      information  RESULTS: The average accuracy of the NLP engine over all variables      was 0 89  range: 0 62-1 0  and the average F measure over all variables was 0 74        range: 0 49-0 89   The average agreement score, measured as Cohen's kappa,      between the manually established and NLP-derived outcomes of the quality measures      was 0 62  range: 0 09-0 86   DISCUSSION: For nine of the 19 colonoscopy quality      measures, the agreement score was 0 70 or above, which we consider a sufficient      score for the NLP-derived outcomes of these measures to be practically useful for     quality measurement  CONCLUSION: The use of NLP for information extraction from      free-text colonoscopy and pathology reports creates opportunities for large      scale, routine quality measurement, which can support quality improvement in      colonoscopy care

PMID- 21946239   - OBJECTIVE: To better understand barriers associated with the adoption and use of       electronic prescribing of controlled substances  EPCS , a practice recently      established by US Drug Enforcement Administration regulation  MATERIALS AND      METHODS: Prescribers of controlled substances affiliated with a regional health      system were surveyed regarding current electronic prescribing  e-prescribing       activities, current prescribing of controlled substances, and expectations and      barriers to the adoption of EPCS  RESULTS: 246 prescribers  response rate of 64%       represented a range of medical specialties, with 43 1% of these prescribers      current users of e-prescribing for non-controlled substances  Reported issues      with controlled substances included errors, pharmacy call-backs, and diversion;      most prescribers expected EPCS to address many of these problems, specifically      reduce medical errors, improve work flow and efficiency of practice, help      identify prescription diversion or misuse, and improve patient treatment      management  Prescribers expected, however, that it would be disruptive to      practice, and over one-third of respondents reported that carrying a security      authentication token at all times would be so burdensome as to discourage      adoption  DISCUSSION: Although adoption of e-prescribing has been shown to      dramatically reduce medication errors, challenges to efficient processes and      errors still persist from the perspective of the prescriber, that may interfere      with the adoption of EPCS  Most prescribers regarded EPCS security measures as a       small or moderate inconvenience  other than carrying a security token , with      advantages outweighing the burden  CONCLUSION: Prescribers are optimistic about      the potential for EPCS to improve practice, but view certain security measures as      a burden and potential barrier

PMID- 21946238   - BACKGROUND: Adverse drug events  ADE  cause considerable harm to patients, and      consequently their detection is critical for patient safety  The US Food and Drug      Administration maintains an adverse event reporting system  AERS  to facilitate      the detection of ADE in drugs  Various data mining approaches have been developed      that use AERS to detect signals identifying associations between drugs and ADE       The signals must then be monitored further by domain experts, which is a      time-consuming task  OBJECTIVE: To develop a new methodology that combines      existing data mining algorithms with chemical information by analysis of      molecular fingerprints to enhance initial ADE signals generated from AERS, and to      provide a decision support mechanism to facilitate the identification of novel      adverse events  RESULTS: The method achieved a significant improvement in      precision in identifying known ADE, and a more than twofold signal enhancement      when applied to the ADE rhabdomyolysis  The simplicity of the method assists in      highlighting the etiology of the ADE by identifying structurally similar drugs  A      set of drugs with strong evidence from both AERS and molecular fingerprint-based       modeling is constructed for further analysis  CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate      that the proposed methodology could be used as a pharmacovigilance decision      support tool to facilitate ADE detection

PMID- 21946237   - ObjectiveFailure to reach research subject recruitment goals is a significant      impediment to the success of many clinical trials  Implementation of      health-information technology has allowed retrospective analysis of data for     cohort identification and recruitment, but few institutions have also leveraged      real-time streams to support such activities DesignDuke Medicine has deployed a      hybrid solution, The Duke Integrated Subject Cohort and Enrollment Research      Network  DISCERN , that combines both retrospective warehouse data and clinical      events contained in prospective Health Level 7  HL7  messages to immediately      alert study personnel of potential recruits as they become      eligible ResultsDISCERN analyzes more than 500 000 messages daily in service of      12 projects  Users may receive results via email, text pages, or on-demand      reports  Preliminary results suggest DISCERN's unique ability to reason over both      retrospective and real-time data increases study enrollment rates while reducing       the time required to complete recruitment-related tasks  The authors have      introduced a preconfigured DISCERN function as a self-service feature for     users LimitationsThe DISCERN framework is adoptable primarily by organizations      using both HL7 message streams and a data warehouse  More efficient recruitment      may exacerbate competition for research subjects, and investigators uncomfortable      with new technology may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in      recruitment ConclusionDISCERN's hybrid framework for identifying real-time      clinical events housed in HL7 messages complements the traditional approach of      using retrospective warehoused data  DISCERN is helpful in instances when the      required clinical data may not be loaded into the warehouse and thus must be      captured contemporaneously during patient care  Use of an open-source tool      supports generalizability to other institutions at minimal cost

PMID- 21946236   - OBJECTIVE: To understand the complex effects of interruption in healthcare       MATERIALS AND METHODS: As interruptions have been well studied in other domains,       the authors undertook a systematic review of experimental studies in psychology      and human-computer interaction to identify the task types and variables      influencing interruption effects  RESULTS: 63 studies were identified from 812      articles retrieved by systematic searches  On the basis of interruption profiles       for generic tasks, it was found that clinical tasks can be distinguished into      three broad types: procedural, problem-solving, and decision-making  Twelve      experimental variables that influence interruption effects were identified  Of      these, six are the most important, based on the number of studies and because of       their centrality to interruption effects, including working memory load,      interruption position, similarity, modality, handling strategies, and practice      effect  The variables are explained by three main theoretical frameworks: the      activation-based goal memory model, prospective memory, and multiple resource      theory  DISCUSSION: This review provides a useful starting point for a more      comprehensive examination of interruptions potentially leading to an improved      understanding about the impact of this phenomenon on patient safety and task      efficiency  The authors provide some recommendations to counter interruption      effects  CONCLUSION: The effects of interruption are the outcome of a complex set      of variables and should not be considered as uniformly predictable or bad  The      task types, variables, and theories should help us better to identify which      clinical tasks and contexts are most susceptible and assist in the design of      information systems and processes that are resilient to interruption

PMID- 21946235   - OBJECTIVES: To create user-friendly search filters with high sensitivity,      specificity, and precision to identify articles on geriatric medicine in Medline       DESIGN: A diagnostic test assessment framework was used  A reference set of 2255       articles was created by hand-searching 22 biomedical journals in Medline, and      each article was labeled as 'relevant', 'not relevant', or 'possibly relevant'      for geriatric medicine  From the relevant articles, search terms were identified       to compile different search strategies  The articles retrieved by the various      search strategies were compared with articles from the reference set as the index      test to create the search filters  MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, precision,      accuracy, and number-needed-to-read  NNR  were calculated by comparing the      results retrieved by the different search strategies with the reference set       RESULTS: The most sensitive search filter had a sensitivity of 94 8%, a      specificity of 88 7%, a precision of 73 0%, and an accuracy of 90 2%  It had an      NNR of 1 37  The most specific search filter had a specificity of 96 6%, a      sensitivity of 69 1%, a precision of 86 6%, and an accuracy of 89 9%  It had an      NNR of 1 15  CONCLUSION: These geriatric search filters simplify searching for     relevant literature and therefore contribute to better evidence-based practice       The filters are useful to both the clinician who wants to find a quick answer to       a clinical question and the researcher who wants to find as many relevant      articles as possible without retrieving too many irrelevant articles

PMID- 21926112   - ObjectiveElectronically linked datasets have become an important part of clinical      research  Information from multiple sources can be used to identify comorbid      conditions and patient outcomes, measure use of healthcare services, and enrich      demographic and clinical variables of interest  Innovative approaches for     creating research infrastructure beyond a traditional data system are      necessary Materials and methodsRecords from a large healthcare system's      enterprise data warehouse  EDW  were linked to a statewide population database,      and a master subject index was created  The authors evaluate the linkage, along      with the impact of missing information in EDW records and the coverage of the      population database  The makeup of the EDW and population database provides a      subset of cancer records that exist in both resources, which allows a      cancer-specific evaluation of the linkage ResultsAbout 3 4 million records       60 8%  in the EDW were linked to the population database with a minimum accuracy      of 96 3%  It was estimated that approximately 24 8% of target records were absent      from the population database, which enabled the effect of the amount and type of       information missing from a record on the linkage to be estimated  However, 99% of      the records from the oncology data mart linked; they had fewer missing fields and      this correlated positively with the number of patient visits Discussion and      conclusionA general-purpose research infrastructure was created which allows      disease-specific cohorts to be identified  The usefulness of creating an index      between institutions is that it allows each institution to maintain control and      confidentiality of their own information

PMID- 21917645   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether past access to biomedical documents can predict      future document access  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors used 394 days of query      log  August 1, 2009 to August 29, 2010  from PubMed users in the Texas Medical      Center, which is the largest medical center in the world  The authors evaluated      two document access models based on the work of Anderson and Schooler  The first       is based on how frequently a document was accessed  The second is based on both      frequency and recency  RESULTS: The model based only on frequency of past access       was highly correlated with the empirical data  R 2 =0 932 , whereas the model      based on frequency and recency had a much lower correlation  R 2 =0 668        DISCUSSION: The frequency-only model accurately predicted whether a document will      be accessed based on past use  Modeling accesses as a function of frequency      requires storing only the number of accesses and the creation date for the      document  This model requires low storage overheads and is computationally      efficient, making it scalable to large corpora such as MEDLINE  CONCLUSION: It is      feasible to accurately model the probability of a document being accessed in the       future based on past accesses

PMID- 21900701   - OBJECTIVE: Current techniques for knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation  WSD       of ambiguous biomedical terms rely on relations in the Unified Medical Language      System Metathesaurus but do not take into account the domain of the target      documents  The authors' goal is to improve these methods by using information      about the topic of the document in which the ambiguous term appears  DESIGN: The       authors proposed and implemented several methods to extract lists of key terms      associated with Medical Subject Heading terms  These key terms are used to      represent the document topic in a knowledge-based WSD system  They are applied      both alone and in combination with local context  MEASUREMENTS: A standard      measure of accuracy was calculated over the set of target words in the widely      used National Library of Medicine WSD dataset  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The      authors report a significant improvement when combining those key terms with      local context, showing that domain information improves the results of a WSD      system based on the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus alone  The best      results were obtained using key terms obtained by relevance feedback and weighted      by inverse document frequency

PMID- 21900700   - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare delivery organizations are increasingly using online      personal health records  PHRs  to provide patients with direct access to their     clinical information; however, there may be a lack of consistency in the data      made available  We aimed to understand the general use and functionality of PHRs       and the organizational policies and decision-making structures for making data      available to patients  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was      administered by telephone structured interview to 21 organizations to determine      the types of data made available to patients through PHRs and the presence of      explicit governance for PHR data release  Organizations were identified based on       a review of the literature, PHR experts, and snowball sampling  Organizations      that did not provide patients with electronic access to their data via a PHR were      excluded  RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 17 organizations for a response      rate of 81%  Half of the organizations had explicit governance in the form of a      written policy that outlined the data types made available to patients  Overall,       88% of the organizations used a committee structure for the decision-making      process and included senior management and information services  All      organizations sought input from clinicians  Discussion There was considerable      variability in the types of clinical data and the time frame for releasing these       data to patients  Variability in data release policies may have implications for       PHR use and adoption  CONCLUSIONS: Future policy activities, such as requirement       specification for the latter stages of Meaningful Use, should be leveraged as an       opportunity to encourage standardization of functionality and broad deployment of      PHRs

PMID- 21890874   - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a grounded needs assessment to elicit community-based      physicians' current views on clinical decision support  CDS  and its desired      capabilities that may assist future CDS design and development for     community-based practices  MATERIALS AND METHODS: To gain insight into      community-based physicians' goals, environments, tasks, and desired support      tools, we used a human-computer interaction model that was based in grounded      theory  We conducted 30 recorded interviews with, and 25 observations of, primary      care providers within 15 urban and rural community-based clinics across Oregon       Participants were members of three healthcare organizations with different      commercial electronic health record systems  We used a grounded theory approach      to analyze data and develop a user-centered definition of CDS and themes related       to desired CDS functionalities  RESULTS: Physicians viewed CDS as a set of      software tools that provide alerts, prompts, and reference tools, but not tools      to support patient management, clinical operations, or workflow, which they would      like  They want CDS to enhance physician-patient relationships, redirect work      among staff, and provide time-saving tools  Participants were generally      dissatisfied with current CDS capabilities and overall electronic health record      usability  DISCUSSION: Physicians identified different aspects of decision-making      in need of support: clinical decision-making such as medication administration      and treatment, and cognitive decision-making that enhances relationships and      interactions with patients and staff  CONCLUSION: Physicians expressed a need for     decision support that extended beyond their own current definitions  To meet this      requirement, decision support tools must integrate functions that align time and       resources in ways that assist providers in a broad range of decisions

PMID- 21890873   - OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical relevance of medication alerts in a basic and      in an advanced clinical decision support system  CDSS   DESIGN: A prospective      observational study  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 4023 medication orders      in a hospital for independent evaluation in two pharmacotherapy-related decision       support systems  Only the more advanced system considered patient characteristics      and laboratory test results in its algorithms  Two pharmacists assessed the      clinical relevance of the medication alerts produced  The alert was considered      relevant if the pharmacist would undertake action  eg, contact the physician or     the nurse   The primary analysis concerned the positive predictive value  PPV       for clinically relevant medication alerts in both systems  RESULTS: The PPV was      significantly higher in the advanced system  5 8% vs 17 0%; p<0 05   Significant       differences were found in the alert categories: drug- drug  interaction  9 9% vs       14 8%; p<0 05 , drug-age interaction  2 9% vs 73 3%; p<0 05 , and dosing guidance       5 6% vs 16 9%; p<0 05   Including laboratory values and other patient      characteristics resulted in a significantly higher PPV for the advanced CDSS      compared to the basic medication alerts  12 2% vs 23 3%; p<0 05   CONCLUSION: The      advanced CDSS produced a higher proportion of clinically relevant medication      alerts, but the number of irrelevant alerts remained high  To improve the PPV of       the advanced CDSS, the algorithms should be optimized by identifying additional      risk modifiers and more data should be made electronically available to improve      the performance of the algorithms  Our study illustrates and corroborates the      need for cyclic testing of technical improvements in information technology in      circumstances representative of daily clinical practice

PMID- 21890871   - BackgroundAlthough the penetration of electronic health records is increasing      rapidly, much of the historical medical record is only available in handwritten      notes and forms, which require labor-intensive, human chart abstraction for some       clinical research  The few previous studies on automated extraction of data from       these handwritten notes have focused on monolithic, custom-developed recognition       systems or third-party systems that require proprietary forms MethodsWe present      an optical character recognition processing pipeline, which leverages the      capabilities of existing third-party optical character recognition engines, and      provides the flexibility offered by a modular custom-developed system  The system      was configured and run on a selected set of form fields extracted from a corpus      of handwritten ophthalmology forms ObservationsThe processing pipeline allowed      multiple configurations to be run, with the optimal configuration consisting of      the Nuance and LEADTOOLS engines running in parallel with a positive predictive      value of 94 6% and a sensitivity of 13 5% DiscussionWhile limitations exist,      preliminary experience from this project yielded insights on the generalizability      and applicability of integrating multiple, inexpensive general-purpose      third-party optical character recognition engines in a modular pipeline

PMID- 21875867   - OBJECTIVE: Renal transplantation has dramatically improved the survival rate of      hemodialysis patients  However, with a growing proportion of marginal organs and       improved immunosuppression, it is necessary to verify that the established      allocation system, mostly based on human leukocyte antigen matching, still meets       today's needs  The authors turn to machine-learning techniques to predict, from      donor-recipient data, the estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  of the      recipient 1 year after transplantation  DESIGN: The patient's eGFR was predicted       using donor-recipient characteristics available at the time of transplantation       Donors' data were obtained from Eurotransplant's database, while recipients'      details were retrieved from Charite Campus Virchow-Klinikum's database  A total      of 707 renal transplantations from cadaveric donors were included  MEASUREMENTS:       Two separate datasets were created, taking features with <10% missing values for       one and <50% missing values for the other  Four established regressors were run      on both datasets, with and without feature selection  RESULTS: The authors      obtained a Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and real eGFR  COR        of 0 48  The best model for the dataset was a Gaussian support vector machine      with recursive feature elimination on the more inclusive dataset  All results are      available at http://transplant molgen mpg de/  LIMITATIONS: For now, missing      values in the data must be predicted and filled in  The performance is not as      high as hoped, but the dataset seems to be the main cause  CONCLUSIONS:      Predicting the outcome is possible with the dataset at hand  COR=0 48   Valuable       features include age and creatinine levels of the donor, as well as sex and      weight of the recipient

PMID- 21875866   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate practitioners' expectations of, and satisfaction with,      older and newer electronic health records  EHRs  after a transition  MATERIAL AND      METHODS: Pre- and post-transition survey administered at six academic-affiliated       ambulatory care practices from 2006 to 2008  Four practices transitioned to one      commercial EHR and two practices to another  We compared respondents'      expectations of, and satisfaction with, the newer EHR  RESULTS: 523 subjects were      eligible: 217 were available before transition and 306 after transition  162      pre-transition and 197 post-transition responses were received, yielding 75% and       64% response rates, respectively  Practitioners were more satisfied with the      newer EHRs  64%  compared with the older  56%   p=0 15  and a small majority       58%  were satisfied with the transition  Practitioners' satisfaction with the      older EHRs for completing clinical tasks was high  The newer EHRs exceeded      practitioner expectations regarding remote access  61% vs 74%; p=0 03   However,       the newer EHRs did not meet practitioners' expectations regarding their ability      to perform clinical tasks, or more globally, improve medication safety  81% vs      61%; p<0 001 , efficiency  70% vs 44%; p<0 001 , and quality of care  77% vs 67%;      p=0 04   DISCUSSION: Most practitioners had favorable opinions about EHRs and      reported overall improved satisfaction with the newer EHRs  However,      practitioners' high expectations of the newer EHRs were often unmet regarding      facilitation of specific clinical tasks or for improving quality, safety, and      efficiency  CONCLUSION: To ensure practitioners' expectations, for instance      regarding improvements in medication safety, are met, vendors should develop and       implement refinements in their software as practices upgrade to newer, certified       EHRs

PMID- 21873473   - ObjectiveThe Cross-Institutional Clinical Translational Research project explored      a federated query tool and looked at how this tool can facilitate clinical trial       cohort discovery by managing access to aggregate patient data located within      unaffiliated academic medical centers MethodsThe project adapted software from      the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside  i2b2  program to connect      three Clinical Translational Research Award sites: University of Washington,      Seattle, University of California, Davis, and University of California, San      Francisco  The project developed an iterative spiral software development model      to support the implementation and coordination of this multisite data      resource ResultsBy standardizing technical infrastructures, policies, and      semantics, the project enabled federated querying of deidentified clinical      datasets stored in separate institutional environments and identified barriers to      engaging users for measuring utility DiscussionThe authors discuss the iterative       development and evaluation phases of the project and highlight the challenges      identified and the lessons learned ConclusionThe common system architecture and      translational processes provide high-level  aggregate  deidentified access to a      large patient population  >5 million patients , and represent a novel and      extensible resource  Enhancing the network for more focused disease areas will      require research-driven partnerships represented across all partner sites

PMID- 21857023   - With the proliferation of relatively mature health information technology  IT       systems with large numbers of users, it becomes increasingly important to      evaluate the effect of these systems on the quality and safety of healthcare       Previous research on the effectiveness of health IT has had mixed results, which       may be in part attributable to the evaluation frameworks used  The authors      propose a model for evaluation, the Triangle Model, developed for designing      studies of quality and safety outcomes of health IT  This model identifies      structure-level predictors, including characteristics of:  1  the technology      itself;  2  the provider using the technology;  3  the organizational setting;      and  4  the patient population  In addition, the model outlines process      predictors, including  1  usage of the technology,  2  organizational support for     and customization of the technology, and  3  organizational policies and      procedures about quality and safety  The Triangle Model specifies the variables      to be measured, but is flexible enough to accommodate both qualitative and      quantitative approaches to capturing them  The authors illustrate this model,      which integrates perspectives from both health services research and biomedical      informatics, with examples from evaluations of electronic prescribing, but it is       also applicable to a variety of types of health IT systems

PMID- 21856688   - The Primary Care Information Project is a New York City initiative aimed at      improving population health through the improved delivery of preventive care  It       has assisted with the adoption of a fully functional electronic health record       EHR  in over 300 primary care practices  Practices with EHRs automatically      transmit summary data that can be used to track population health indicators for       recommended preventive care  Early analysis, focusing on small practices with      fewer than 10 providers serving Medicaid and uninsured populations, showed      increases in the delivery of recommended services of 0 1-2 4% per month  p </=      0 05   However, measurement of preventive care across this population is limited       by some inconsistency of data transmission  This study shows that EHRs can be      used to track the delivery of recommended preventive care across small primary      care practices serving lower income communities in which few data are generally      available for assessing population health

PMID- 21856687   - OBJECTIVES: Many clinical research data integration platforms rely on the      Entity-Attribute-Value model because of its flexibility, even though it presents       problems in query formulation and execution time  The authors sought more balance      in these traits  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Borrowing concepts from      Entity-Attribute-Value and from enterprise data warehousing, the authors designed      an alternative called the Dimensional Bus model and used it to integrate      electronic medical record, sponsored study, and biorepository data  Each type of       observational collection has its own table, and the structure of these tables      varies to suit the source data  The observational tables are linked to the Bus,      which holds provenance information and links to various classificatory dimensions      that amplify the meaning of the data or facilitate its query and exposure      management  RESULTS: The authors implemented a Bus-based clinical research data      repository with a query system that flexibly manages data access and      confidentiality, facilitates catalog search, and readily formulates and compiles       complex queries  CONCLUSION: The design provides a workable way to manage and      query mixed schemas in a data warehouse

PMID- 21852412   - OBJECTIVE: The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funded an evidence      report to address seven questions on multiple aspects of the effectiveness of      medication management information technology  MMIT  and its components       prescribing, order communication, dispensing, administering, and monitoring        MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and 11 other databases without language or date      limitations to mid-2010  Randomized controlled trials  RCTs  assessing integrated      MMIT were selected by two independent reviewers  Reviewers assessed study quality      and extracted data  Senior staff checked accuracy  RESULTS: Most of the 87 RCTs      focused on clinical decision support and computerized provider order entry      systems, were performed in hospitals and clinics, included primarily physicians      and sometimes nurses but not other health professionals, and studied process      changes related to prescribing and monitoring medication  Processes of care      improved for prescribing and monitoring mostly in hospital settings, but the few       studies measuring clinical outcomes showed small or no improvements  Studies were      performed most frequently in the USA  n=63 , Europe  n=16 , and Canada  n=6        DISCUSSION: Many studies had limited description of systems, installations,      institutions, and targets of the intervention  Problems with methods and analyses      were also found  Few studies addressed order communication, dispensing, or     administering, non-physician prescribers or pharmacists and their MMIT tools, or       patients and caregivers  Other study methods are also needed to completely      understand the effects of MMIT  CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of MMIT interventions      improved the process of care, but few studies measured clinical outcomes  This      large body of literature, although instructive, is not uniformly distributed      across settings, people, medication phases, or outcomes

PMID- 21849334   - OBJECTIVE: Alerting systems, a type of clinical decision support, are      increasingly prevalent in healthcare, yet few studies have concurrently measured       the appropriateness of alerts with provider responses to alerts  Recent reports      of suboptimal alert system design and implementation highlight the need for     better evaluation to inform future designs  The authors present a comprehensive      framework for evaluating the clinical appropriateness of synchronous,      interruptive medication safety alerts  METHODS: Through literature review and      iterative testing, metrics were developed that describe successes, justifiable      overrides, provider non-adherence, and unintended adverse consequences of      clinical decision support alerts  The framework was validated by applying it to a      medication alerting system for patients with acute kidney injury  AKI   RESULTS:       Through expert review, the framework assesses each alert episode for     appropriateness of the alert display and the necessity and urgency of a clinical       response  Primary outcomes of the framework include the false positive alert      rate, alert override rate, provider non-adherence rate, and rate of provider     response appropriateness  Application of the framework to evaluate an existing      AKI medication alerting system provided a more complete understanding of the      process outcomes measured in the AKI medication alerting system  The authors      confirmed that previous alerts and provider responses were most often      appropriate  CONCLUSION: The new evaluation model offers a potentially effective       method for assessing the clinical appropriateness of synchronous interruptive      medication alerts prior to evaluating patient outcomes in a comparative trial       More work can determine the generalizability of the framework for use in other     settings and other alert types

PMID- 21849333   - Tourism as well as international business travel creates health risks for     individuals and populations both in host societies and home countries  One      strategy to reduce health-related risks to travelers is to provide travelers and       relevant caregivers timely, ongoing access to their own health information  Many       websites offer health advice for travelers  For example, the WHO and US      Department of State offer up-to-date health information about countries relevant       to travel  However, little has been done to assure travelers that their medical      information is available at the right place and time when the need might arise       Applications of Information and Communication Technology  ICT  utilizing mobile      phones for health management are promising tools both for the delivery of      healthcare services and the promotion of personal health  This paper describes      the project developed by international informaticians under the umbrella of the      International Medical Informatics Association  A template capable of becoming an       international standard is proposed  This application is available free to anyone       who is interested  Furthermore, its source code is made open

PMID- 21849332   - Tobacco use is increasingly prevalent among vulnerable populations, such as      people living in rural Appalachian communities  Owing to limited access to a      reliable internet service in such settings, there is no widespread adoption of      electronic data capture tools for conducting community-based research  By      integrating the REDCap data collection application with a custom synchronization       tool, the authors have enabled a workflow in which field research staff located      throughout the Ohio Appalachian region can electronically collect and share      research data  In addition to allowing the study data to be exchanged in      near-real-time among the geographically distributed study staff and centralized      study coordinator, the system architecture also ensures that the data are stored       securely on encrypted laptops in the field and centrally behind the Ohio State      University Medical Center enterprise firewall  The authors believe that this      approach can be easily applied to other analogous study designs and settings

PMID- 21846788   - OBJECTIVE: Health information exchange  HIE  systems are being developed across      the nation  Understanding approaches taken by existing successful exchanges can      help new exchange efforts determine goals and plan implementations  The goal of      this study was to explore characteristics of use and users of a successful      regional HIE  DESIGN: We used a mixed-method analysis, consisting of      cross-sectional audit log data, semi-structured interviews, and direct      observation in a sample of emergency departments and ambulatory safety net      clinics actively using HIE  For each site, we measured overall usage trends, user     logon statistics, and data types accessed by users  We also assessed reasons for       use and outcomes of use  RESULTS: Overall, users accessed HIE for 6 8% of all      encounters, with higher rates of access for repeat visits, for patients with      comorbidities, for patients known to have data in the exchange, and at sites      providing HIE access to both nurses and physicians  Discharge summaries and test       reports were the most frequently accessed data in the exchange  Providers      consistently noted retrieving additional history, preventing repeat tests,      comparing new results to retrieved results, and avoiding hospitalizations as a      consequence of HIE access  CONCLUSION: HIE use in emergency departments and      ambulatory clinics was focused on patients where missing information was believed      to be present in the exchange and was related to factors including the roles of      people with access, the setting, and other site-specific issues that impacted the      overall breadth of routine system use  These data should form an important      foundation as other sites embark upon HIE implementation

PMID- 21846787   - OBJECTIVE: A supervised machine learning approach to discover relations between      medical problems, treatments, and tests mentioned in electronic medical records        MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single support vector machine classifier was used to      identify relations between concepts and to assign their semantic type  Several      resources such as Wikipedia, WordNet, General Inquirer, and a relation similarity      metric inform the classifier  RESULTS: The techniques reported in this paper were      evaluated in the 2010 i2b2 Challenge and obtained the highest F1 score for the      relation extraction task  When gold standard data for concepts and assertions      were available, F1 was 73 7, precision was 72 0, and recall was 75 3  F1 is      defined as 2*Precision*Recall/ Precision+Recall   Alternatively, when concepts      and assertions were discovered automatically, F1 was 48 4, precision was 57 6,      and recall was 41 7  DISCUSSION: Although a rich set of features was developed      for the classifiers presented in this paper, little knowledge mining was      performed from medical ontologies such as those found in UMLS  Future studies      should incorporate features extracted from such knowledge sources, which we      expect to further improve the results  Moreover, each relation discovery was      treated independently  Joint classification of relations may further improve the       quality of results  Also, joint learning of the discovery of concepts,      assertions, and relations may also improve the results of automatic relation      extraction  CONCLUSION: Lexical and contextual features proved to be very      important in relation extraction from medical texts  When they are not available       to the classifier, the F1 score decreases by 3 7%  In addition, features based on      similarity contribute to a decrease of 1 1% when they are not available

PMID- 21846780   - OBJECTIVE: Despite efforts made by ambulatory care organizations to standardize      the use of electronic health records  EHRs , practices often incorporate these      systems into their work differently from each other  One potential factor     contributing to these differences is within-practice communication patterns  The       authors explore the linkage between within-practice communication patterns and      practice-level EHR use patterns  DESIGN: Qualitative study of six practices      operating within the same multi-specialty ambulatory care organization using the       same EHR system  Semistructured interviews and direct observation were conducted       with all physicians, nurses, medical assistants, practice managers, and      non-clinical staff from each practice  MEASUREMENTS: An existing model of      practice relationships was used to analyze communication patterns within the      practices  Practice-level EHR use was defined and analyzed as the ways in which a      practice uses an EHR as a collective or a group-including the degree of feature      use, level of EHR-enabled communication, and frequency that EHR use changes in a       practice  Interview and observation data were analyzed for themes  Based on these      themes, within-practice communication patterns were categorized as fragmented or       cohesive, and practice-level EHR use patterns were categorized as heterogeneous      or homogeneous  Practices where EHR use was uniformly high across all users were       further categorized as having standardized EHR use  Communication patterns and      EHR use patterns were compared across the six practices  RESULTS: Within-practice      communication patterns were associated with practice-level EHR use patterns  In      practices where communication patterns were fragmented, EHR use was      heterogeneous  In practices where communication patterns were cohesive, EHR use      was homogeneous  Additional analysis revealed that practices that had achieved      standardized EHR use  uniformly high EHR use across all users  exhibited high      levels of mindfulness and respectful interaction, whereas practices that were      furthest from achieving standardized EHR use exhibited low levels of mindfulness       and respectful interaction  CONCLUSION: Within-practice communication patterns      provide a unique perspective for exploring the issue of standardization in EHR     use  A major fallacy of setting homogeneous EHR use as the goal for     practice-level EHR use is that practices with uniformly low EHR use could be      considered successful  Achieving uniformly high EHR use across all users in a      practice is more consistent with the goals of current EHR adoption and use      efforts  It was found that some communication patterns among practice members may      enable more standardized EHR use than others  Understanding the linkage between      communication patterns and EHR use can inform understanding of the human element       in EHR use and may provide key lessons for the implementation of EHRs and other     health information technologies

PMID- 21846779   - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of capturing the knowledge required to       create guideline recommendations in a systematic, structured, manner using a      software assistant  Practice guidelines constitute an important modality that can      reduce the delivery of inappropriate care and support the introduction of new      knowledge into clinical practice  However, many guideline recommendations are      vague and underspecified, lack any linkage to supporting evidence or     documentation of how they were developed, and prove to be difficult to transform       into systems that influence the behavior of care providers  METHODS: The      BRIDGE-Wiz application  Building Recommendations In a Developer's Guideline      Editor  uses a wizard approach to address the questions:  1  under what      circumstances?  2  who?  3  ought  with what level of obligation?   4  to do      what?  5  to whom?  6  how and why? Controlled natural language was applied to      create and populate a template for recommendation statements  RESULTS: The      application was used by five national panels to develop guidelines  In general,      panelists agreed that the software helped to formalize a process for authoring      guideline recommendations and deemed the application usable and useful       DISCUSSION: Use of BRIDGE-Wiz promotes clarity of recommendations by limiting      verb choices, building active voice recommendations, incorporating decidability      and executability checks, and limiting Boolean connectors  It enhances      transparency by incorporating systematic appraisal of evidence quality, benefits,      and harms  BRIDGE-Wiz promotes implementability by providing a pseudocode rule,      suggesting deontic modals, and limiting the use of 'consider'  CONCLUSION: Users       found that BRIDGE-Wiz facilitates the development of clear, transparent, and      implementable guideline recommendations

PMID- 21836158   - OBJECTIVE: Expert authorities recommend clinical decision support systems to      reduce prescribing error rates, yet large numbers of insignificant on-screen      alerts presented in modal dialog boxes persistently interrupt clinicians,      limiting the effectiveness of these systems  This study compared the impact of      modal and non-modal electronic  e-  prescribing alerts on prescribing error     rates, to help inform the design of clinical decision support systems  DESIGN: A       randomized study of 24 junior doctors each performing 30 simulated prescribing      tasks in random order with a prototype e-prescribing system  Using a      within-participant design, doctors were randomized to be shown one of three types      of e-prescribing alert  modal, non-modal, no alert  during each prescribing task       MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measure was prescribing error rate  Structured      interviews were performed to elicit participants' preferences for the prescribing      alerts and their views on clinical decision support systems  RESULTS:      Participants exposed to modal alerts were 11 6 times less likely to make a      prescribing error than those not shown an alert  OR 11 56, 95% CI 6 00 to 22 26        Those shown a non-modal alert were 3 2 times less likely to make a prescribing      error  OR 3 18, 95% CI 1 91 to 5 30  than those not shown an alert  The error     rate with non-modal alerts was 3 6 times higher than with modal alerts  95% CI      1 88 to 7 04   CONCLUSIONS: Both kinds of e-prescribing alerts significantly      reduced prescribing error rates, but modal alerts were over three times more      effective than non-modal alerts  This study provides new evidence about the      relative effects of modal and non-modal alerts on prescribing outcomes

PMID- 21836157   - Many aberration detection algorithms are used in infectious disease surveillance       systems to assist in the early detection of potential outbreaks  In this study,      we explored a novel approach to adjusting aberration detection algorithms to      account for the impact of seasonality inherent in some surveillance data  By      using surveillance data for hand-foot-and-mouth disease in Shandong province,      China, we evaluated the use of seasonally-adjusted alerting thresholds with three      aberration detection methods  C1, C2, and C3   We found that the optimal      thresholds of C1, C2, and C3 varied between the epidemic and non-epidemic seasons      of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and the application of seasonally adjusted      thresholds improved the performance of outbreak detection by maintaining the same      sensitivity and timeliness while decreasing by nearly half the false alert rate      during the non-epidemic season  Our preliminary findings suggest a general      approach to improving aberration detection for outbreaks of infectious disease      with seasonally variable incidence

PMID- 21836156   - OBJECTIVE: Many Dutch hospitals have established internal systems for reporting      incidents  However, such internal systems do not allow learning from incidents      that occur in other hospitals  Therefore a multicenter, information technology       IT  supported reporting system named central medication incidents registration       CMR  was developed  This article describes the architecture, implementation and       current status of the CMR in The Netherlands and compare it with similar systems       in other countries  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: Adequate IT is required to sufficiently      support a multicenter reporting system  The CMR system consists of a website, a      database, a web-based reporting form, an application to import reports generated       in other reporting systems, an application to generate an overview of reported      medication incidents, and a national warning system for healthcare providers       CURRENT STATUS: From the start of CMR 90 of all 93  96 8%  hospitals and 872 of      1948  44 8%  community pharmacies participated  Between March 2006 and March 2010      the CMR comprised 15,694 reports of incidents  In the period from March 2010 to      March 2011, 1642 reports were submitted by community pharmacies in CMR and the      hospitals submitted 2517 reports  CMR is similar to various systems in other     countries, but it seems to use more IT applications  DISCUSSION: The CMR is      developing into a nationwide reporting system of medication incidents in The      Netherlands, in which hospitals, community pharmacies, mental healthcare      organizations and general practitioners participate  CONCLUSION: The architecture      of the system met the requirements of a nationwide reporting system across      different healthcare providers

PMID- 21828225   - OBJECTIVE: To present a partnership-based and community-oriented approach      designed to ease provider anxiety and facilitate the implementation of electronic      health records  EHR  in resource-limited primary care settings  MATERIALS AND      METHODS: The approach, referred to as partnership model, was developed and      iteratively refined through the research team's previous work on implementing      health information technology  HIT  in over 30 safety net practices  This paper     uses two case studies to illustrate how the model was applied to help two      nurse-managed health centers  NMHC , a particularly vulnerable primary care      setting, implement EHR and get prepared to meet the meaningful use criteria       RESULTS: The strong focus of the model on continuous quality improvement led to      eventual implementation success at both sites, despite difficulties encountered      during the initial stages of the project  DISCUSSION: There has been a lack of      research, particularly in resource-limited primary care settings, on strategies      for abating provider anxiety and preparing them to manage complex changes      associated with EHR uptake  The partnership model described in this paper may      provide useful insights into the work shepherded by HIT regional extension      centers dedicated to supporting resource-limited communities disproportionally      affected by EHR adoption barriers  CONCLUSION: NMHC, similar to other primary      care settings, are often poorly resourced, understaffed, and lack the necessary      expertise to deploy EHR and integrate its use into their day-to-day practice       This study demonstrates that implementation of EHR, a prerequisite to meaningful       use, can be successfully achieved in this setting, and partnership efforts      extending far beyond the initial software deployment stage may be the key

PMID- 21803924   - Standard written methods of presenting research information may be difficult for       many parents and children to understand  This pilot study was designed to examine      the use of a novel prototype interactive consent program for describing a      hypothetical pediatric asthma trial to parents and children  Parents and children      were interviewed to examine their baseline understanding of key elements of a      clinical trial, eg, randomization, placebo, and blinding  Subjects then reviewed       age-appropriate versions of an interactive computer program describing an asthma       trial, and their understanding of key research concepts was again tested along      with their understanding of the details of the trial  Parents and children also      completed surveys to examine their perceptions and satisfaction with the program       Both parents and children demonstrated improved understanding of key research      concepts following administration of the consent program  For example, the      percentage of parents and children who could correctly define the terms clinical       trials and placebo improved from 60% to 80%, and 80% to 100% among parents and      25% to 50% and 0% to 50% among children, respectively, following review of the      interactive programs  Parents and children's overall understanding of the details      of the asthma trial were 14 2+/-0 84 and 9 25+/-4 9  0-15 scale, where 15 is      complete understanding , respectively  Results also suggest that the interactive       programs were easy to use and facilitated understanding of the clinical trial      among parents and children  Interactive media may offer an effective means of      presenting understandable information to parents and children regarding      participation in clinical trials  Further work to examine this novel approach      appears warranted

PMID- 21764888   - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the Canadian health information technology  HIT  policy      experience and impart lessons learned to the US as it determines its policy in      this area  DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of interviews with identified key      stakeholders followed by an electronic survey  MEASUREMENTS: We conducted      semi-structured interviews with 29 key Canadian HIT policy and opinion leaders      and used a grounded theory approach to analyze the results  The informant sample       was chosen to provide views from different stakeholder groups including national       representatives and regional representatives from three Canadian provinces       RESULTS: Canadian informants believed that much of the current US direction is      positive, especially regarding incentives and meaningful use, but that there are       key opportunities for the US to emphasize direct engagement with providers,      define a clear business case for them, sponsor large scale evaluations to assess       HIT impact in a broad array of settings, determine standards but also enable      access to resources needed for mid-course corrections of standards when issues      are identified, and, finally, leverage implementation of digital imaging systems       LIMITATIONS: Not all stakeholder groups were included, such as providers or     patients  In addition, as in all qualitative research, a selection bias could be       present due to the relatively small sample size  CONCLUSIONS: Based on Canadian      experience with HIT policy, stakeholders identified as lessons for the US the      need to increase direct engagement with providers and the importance of defining       the business case for HIT, which can be achieved through large scale evaluations,      and of recognizing and leveraging successes as they emerge

PMID- 21737844   - OBJECTIVE: Information extraction and classification of clinical data are current      challenges in natural language processing  This paper presents a cascaded method       to deal with three different extractions and classifications in clinical data:      concept annotation, assertion classification and relation classification       MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pipeline system was developed for clinical natural      language processing that includes a proofreading process, with gold-standard      reflexive validation and correction  The information extraction system is a      combination of a machine learning approach and a rule-based approach  The outputs      of this system are used for evaluation in all three tiers of the fourth i2b2/VA      shared-task and workshop challenge  RESULTS: Overall concept classification      attained an F-score of 83 3% against a baseline of 77 0%, the optimal F-score for     assertions about the concepts was 92 4% and relation classifier attained 72 6%      for relationships between clinical concepts against a baseline of 71 0%       Micro-average results for the challenge test set were 81 79%, 91 90% and 70 18%,       respectively  DISCUSSION: The challenge in the multi-task test requires a      distribution of time and work load for each individual task so that the overall      performance evaluation on all three tasks would be more informative rather than      treating each task assessment as independent  The simplicity of the model      developed in this work should be contrasted with the very large feature space of       other participants in the challenge who only achieved slightly better     performance  There is a need to charge a penalty against the complexity of a      model as defined in message minimalisation theory when comparing results       CONCLUSION: A complete pipeline system for constructing language processing      models that can be used to process multiple practical detection tasks of language      structures of clinical records is presented

PMID- 21727206   - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this paper is to describe the successful application of a       use case-based evaluation approach to guide the effective design, evaluation and       redesign of inexpensive, commercial, off-the-shelf consumer health informatics       CHI  interventions  DESIGN: Researchers developed four CHI intervention use      cases representing two distinct patient populations  patients with diabetes with       high blood pressure, post-bariatric surgery patients , two commercial      off-the-shelf CHI applications  Microsoft HealthVault, Google Health , and      related devices  blood pressure monitor, pedometer, weight scale   Three patient       proxies tested each intervention for 10 days  MEASUREMENTS: The patient proxies      recorded their challenges while completing use case tasks, rating the severity of      each challenge based on how much it hindered their use of the intervention  Two      independent evaluators categorized the challenges by human factors domain       physical, cognitive, macroergonomic   RESULTS: The use case-based approach      resulted in the identification of 122 challenges, with 12% physical, 50%      cognitive and 38% macroergonomic  Thirty-nine challenges  32%  were at least      moderately severe  Nine of 22 use case tasks  41%  accounted for 72% of the      challenges  LIMITATIONS: The study used two patient proxies and addressed two      specific patient populations and low-cost, off-the-shelf CHI interventions, which      may not perfectly generalize to a larger number of proxies, actual patient      populations, or other CHI interventions  CONCLUSION: CHI designers can employ the      use case-based evaluation approach to assess the fit of a CHI intervention with      patients' health work, in the context of their daily activities and environment,       which would be difficult or impossible to evaluate by laboratory-based studies

PMID- 21727204   - Cloud computing refers to subscription-based, fee-for-service utilization of      computer hardware and software over the Internet  The model is gaining acceptance      for business information technology  IT  applications because it allows capacity       and functionality to increase on the fly without major investment in      infrastructure, personnel or licensing fees  Large IT investments can be      converted to a series of smaller operating expenses  Cloud architectures could      potentially be superior to traditional electronic health record  EHR  designs in       terms of economy, efficiency and utility  A central issue for EHR developers in      the US is that these systems are constrained by federal regulatory legislation      and oversight  These laws focus on security and privacy, which are      well-recognized challenges for cloud computing systems in general  EHRs built      with the cloud computing model can achieve acceptable privacy and security      through business associate contracts with cloud providers that specify compliance      requirements, performance metrics and liability sharing

PMID- 21727203   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a population-based proband-oriented pedigree information      system that can be easily applied to various diseases in genetic epidemiological       studies, making allowance for the capture of theoretical family relationships       DESIGNS AND MEASUREMENTS: A population-based proband-oriented pedigree      information system with ties of consanguinity based on both population-based      household registry data and Keelung Community Integrated Screening data was      proposed to build a comprehensive extended family pedigree structure to      accommodate a series of genetic studies on different diseases  We also developed       an algorithm to efficiently assess how well theoretical family relationships      affecting the occurrence of diseases across three generations with respect to the      relative relationship score, a quantitative indicator of genetic influence, were       captured  RESULTS: We applied this population-based proband-oriented pedigree      information system to estimate the rate of hypertension with various relative      relationships given the selection of probands  The degree of capturing complete      familial relationships was assessed for three generations  The risk for early      onset of hypertension was proportional to the proband-oriented relative      relationship score with 2% increased risk and 1% correction for incomplete      capture  CONCLUSIONS: The population-based proband-oriented pedigree information       system is powerful and can support various genetic descriptive and analytic      epidemiological studies

PMID- 21724741   - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes natural-language-processing techniques for two      tasks: identification of medical concepts in clinical text, and classification of      assertions, which indicate the existence, absence, or uncertainty of a medical      problem  Because so many resources are available for processing clinical texts,      there is interest in developing a framework in which features derived from these       resources can be optimally selected for the two tasks of interest  MATERIALS AND       METHODS: The authors used two machine-learning  ML  classifiers: support vector     machines  SVMs  and conditional random fields  CRFs   Because SVMs and CRFs can      operate on a large set of features extracted from both clinical texts and      external resources, the authors address the following research question: Which      features need to be selected for obtaining optimal results? To this end, the      authors devise feature-selection techniques which greatly reduce the amount of      manual experimentation and improve performance  RESULTS: The authors evaluated      their approaches on the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge data  Concept extraction achieves       79 59 micro F-measure  Assertion classification achieves 93 94 micro F-measure       DISCUSSION: Approaching medical concept extraction and assertion classification      through ML-based techniques has the advantage of easily adapting to new data sets      and new medical informatics tasks  However, ML-based techniques perform best when      optimal features are selected  By devising promising feature-selection      techniques, the authors obtain results that outperform the current state of the      art  CONCLUSION: This paper presents two ML-based approaches for processing      language in the clinical texts evaluated in the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge  By using       novel feature-selection methods, the techniques presented in this paper are      unique among the i2b2 participants

PMID- 21724740   - OBJECTIVE: There is a need to integrate the various theoretical frameworks and      formalisms for modeling clinical guidelines, workflows, and pathways, in order to      move beyond providing support for individual clinical decisions and toward the      provision of process-oriented, patient-centered, health information systems       HIS   In this review, we analyze the challenges in developing process-oriented      HIS that formally model guidelines, workflows, and care pathways  METHODS: A      qualitative meta-synthesis was performed on studies published in English between       1995 and 2010 that addressed the modeling process and reported the exposition of       a new methodology, model, system implementation, or system architecture  Thematic      analysis, principal component analysis  PCA  and data visualisation techniques      were used to identify and cluster the underlying implementation 'challenge'      themes  RESULTS: One hundred and eight relevant studies were selected for review       Twenty-five underlying 'challenge' themes were identified  These were clustered      into 10 distinct groups, from which a conceptual model of the implementation      process was developed  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that the development      of systems supporting individual clinical decisions is evolving toward the      implementation of adaptable care pathways on the semantic web, incorporating      formal, clinical, and organizational ontologies, and the use of workflow      management systems  These architectures now need to be implemented and evaluated       on a wider scale within clinical settings

PMID- 21724739   - The BT-Nurse system uses data-to-text technology to automatically generate a      natural language nursing shift summary in a neonatal intensive care unit  NICU         The summary is solely based on data held in an electronic patient record system,       no additional data-entry is required  BT-Nurse was tested for two months in the      Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NICU  Nurses were asked to rate the      understandability, accuracy, and helpfulness of the computer-generated summaries;      they were also asked for free-text comments about the summaries  The nurses found      the majority of the summaries to be understandable, accurate, and helpful       p<0 001 for all measures   However, nurses also pointed out many deficiencies,      especially with regard to extra content they wanted to see in the      computer-generated summaries  In conclusion, natural language NICU shift      summaries can be automatically generated from an electronic patient record, but      our proof-of-concept software needs considerable additional development work      before it can be deployed

PMID- 21715429   - OBJECTIVES: Studies on the impact and value of health information technology       HIT  have often focused on outcome measures that are counts of such things as      hospital admissions or the number of laboratory tests per patient  These measures      with their highly skewed distributions  high frequency of 0s and 1s  are more      appropriately analyzed with count data models than the much more frequently used       variations of ordinary least squares  OLS   Use of a statistical procedure that      does not properly fit the distribution of the data can result in significant      findings being overlooked  The objective of this paper is to encourage greater     use of count data models by demonstrating their utility with an example based on       the authors' current work  TARGET AUDIENCE: Researchers conducting impact and      outcome studies related to HIT  SCOPE: We review and discuss count data models      and illustrate their value in comparison to OLS using an example from a study of       the impact of an electronic health record  EHR  on laboratory test orders  The      best count data model reveals significant relationships that OLS does not detect       We conclude that comprehensive model checking is highly recommended to identify      the most appropriate analytic model when the dependent variable being examined      contains count data  This strategy can lead to more valid and precise findings in      HIT evaluation studies

PMID- 21715428   - OBJECTIVE: To report the frequency, types, and causes of errors associated with      outpatient computer-generated prescriptions, and to develop a framework to      classify these errors to determine which strategies have greatest potential for     preventing them  MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of      3850 computer-generated prescriptions received by a commercial outpatient      pharmacy chain across three states over 4 weeks in 2008  A clinician panel      reviewed the prescriptions using a previously described method to identify and      classify medication errors  Primary outcomes were the incidence of medication      errors; potential adverse drug events, defined as errors with potential for harm;      and rate of prescribing errors by error type and by prescribing system  RESULTS:       Of 3850 prescriptions, 452  11 7%  contained 466 total errors, of which 163       35 0%  were considered potential adverse drug events  Error rates varied by      computerized prescribing system, from 5 1% to 37 5%  The most common error was      omitted information  60 7% of all errors   DISCUSSION: About one in 10      computer-generated prescriptions included at least one error, of which a third      had potential for harm  This is consistent with the literature on manual      handwritten prescription error rates  The number, type, and severity of errors      varied by computerized prescribing system, suggesting that some systems may be      better at preventing errors than others  CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a computerized      prescribing system without comprehensive functionality and processes in place to       ensure meaningful system use does not decrease medication errors  The authors      offer targeted recommendations on improving computerized prescribing systems to      prevent errors

PMID- 21709163   - OBJECTIVE: The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  VAERS  collects      spontaneous reports of adverse events following vaccination  Medical officers      review the reports and often apply standardized case definitions, such as those      developed by the Brighton Collaboration  Our objective was to demonstrate a      multi-level text mining approach for automated text classification of VAERS      reports that could potentially reduce human workload  DESIGN: We selected 6034      VAERS reports for H1N1 vaccine that were classified by medical officers as      potentially positive  N pos =237  or negative for anaphylaxis  We created a      categorized corpus of text files that included the class label and the symptom      text field of each report  A validation set of 1100 labeled text files was also      used  Text mining techniques were applied to extract three feature sets for     important keywords, low- and high-level patterns  A rule-based classifier     processed the high-level feature representation, while several machine learning      classifiers were trained for the remaining two feature representations       MEASUREMENTS: Classifiers' performance was evaluated by macro-averaging recall,      precision, and F-measure, and Friedman's test; misclassification error rate      analysis was also performed  RESULTS: Rule-based classifier, boosted trees, and      weighted support vector machines performed well in terms of macro-recall, however     at the expense of a higher mean misclassification error rate  The rule-based      classifier performed very well in terms of average sensitivity and specificity       79 05% and 94 80%, respectively   CONCLUSION: Our validated results showed the      possibility of developing effective medical text classifiers for VAERS reports by      combining text mining with informative feature selection; this strategy has the      potential to reduce reviewer workload considerably

PMID- 21709162   - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of technology to enhance the      tracking and quality of clinical information available for patients in disaster     settings  This paper describes the design and evaluation of the Wireless Internet      Information System for Medical Response in Disasters  WIISARD   MATERIALS AND      METHODS: WIISARD combined advanced networking technology with electronic triage      tags that reported victims' position and recorded medical information, with      wireless pulse-oximeters that monitored patient vital signs, and a wireless      electronic medical record  EMR  for disaster care  The EMR system included WiFi      handheld devices with barcode scanners  used by front-line responders  and      computer tablets with role-tailored software  used by managers of the triage,      treatment, transport and medical communications teams   An additional software      system provided situational awareness for the incident commander  The WIISARD      system was evaluated in a large-scale simulation exercise designed for training      first responders  A randomized trial was overlaid on this exercise with 100      simulated victims, 50 in a control pathway  paper-based , and 50 in completely      electronic WIISARD pathway  All patients in the electronic pathway were cared for     within the WIISARD system without paper-based workarounds  RESULTS: WIISARD      reduced the rate of the missing and/or duplicated patient identifiers  0% vs 47%,      p<0 001   The total time of the field was nearly identical  38:20 vs 38:23, IQR     26:53-1:05:32 vs 18:55-57:22   CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of WIISARD show      that wireless EMR systems for care of the victims of disasters would be complex      to develop but potentially feasible to build and deploy, and likely to improve      the quality of information available for the delivery of care during disasters

PMID- 21709161   - OBJECTIVE: Concept extraction is a process to identify phrases referring to      concepts of interests in unstructured text  It is a critical component in      automated text processing  We investigate the performance of machine learning      taggers for clinical concept extraction, particularly the portability of taggers       across documents from multiple data sources  METHODS: We used BioTagger-GM to      train machine learning taggers, which we originally developed for the detection      of gene/protein names in the biology domain  Trained taggers were evaluated using      the annotated clinical documents made available in the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge      workshop, consisting of documents from four data sources  RESULTS: As expected,      performance of a tagger trained on one data source degraded when evaluated on      another source, but the degradation of the performance varied depending on data      sources  A tagger trained on multiple data sources was robust, and it achieved an      F score as high as 0 890 on one data source  The results also suggest that      performance of machine learning taggers is likely to improve if more annotated      documents are available for training  CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the      performance of machine learning taggers is degraded when they are ported across      clinical documents from different sources  The portability of taggers can be      enhanced by training on datasets from multiple sources  The study also shows that      BioTagger-GM can be easily extended to detect clinical concept mentions with good      performance

PMID- 21697292   - OBJECTIVE: Despite at least 40 years of promising empirical performance, very few      clinical natural language processing  NLP  or information extraction systems      currently contribute to medical science or care  The authors address this gap by       reducing the need for custom software and rules development with a graphical user     interface-driven, highly generalizable approach to concept-level retrieval       MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 'learn by example' approach combines features derived      from open-source NLP pipelines with open-source machine learning classifiers to      automatically and iteratively evaluate top-performing configurations  The Fourth       i2b2/VA Shared Task Challenge's concept extraction task provided the data sets      and metrics used to evaluate performance  RESULTS: Top F-measure scores for each       of the tasks were medical problems  0 83 , treatments  0 82 , and tests  0 83        Recall lagged precision in all experiments  Precision was near or above 0 90 in      all tasks  Discussion With no customization for the tasks and less than      5&emsp14;min of end-user time to configure and launch each experiment, the      average F-measure was 0 83, one point behind the mean F-measure of the 22      entrants in the competition  Strong precision scores indicate the potential of      applying the approach for more specific clinical information extraction tasks       There was not one best configuration, supporting an iterative approach to model      creation  CONCLUSION: Acceptable levels of performance can be achieved using      fully automated and generalizable approaches to concept-level information      extraction  The described implementation and related documentation is available      for download

PMID- 21697291   - OBJECTIVE: To assess intensive care unit  ICU  nurses' acceptance of electronic      health records  EHR  technology and examine the relationship between EHR design,       implementation factors, and nurse acceptance  DESIGN: The authors analyzed data      from two cross-sectional survey questionnaires distributed to nurses working in      four ICUs at a northeastern US regional medical center, 3 months and 12 months      after EHR implementation  MEASUREMENTS: Survey items were drawn from established       instruments used to measure EHR acceptance and usability, and the usefulness of      three EHR functionalities, specifically computerized provider order entry  CPOE ,      the electronic medication administration record  eMAR , and a nursing      documentation flowsheet  RESULTS: On average, ICU nurses were more accepting of      the EHR at 12 months as compared to 3&emsp14;months  They also perceived the EHR       as being more usable and both CPOE and eMAR as being more useful  Multivariate      hierarchical modeling indicated that EHR usability and CPOE usefulness predicted       EHR acceptance at both 3 and 12 months  At 3 months postimplementation, eMAR     usefulness predicted EHR acceptance, but its effect disappeared at 12 months       Nursing flowsheet usefulness predicted EHR acceptance but only at 12 months       CONCLUSION: As the push toward implementation of EHR technology continues, more      hospitals will face issues related to acceptance of EHR technology by staff      caring for critically ill patients  This research suggests that factors related      to technology design have strong effects on acceptance, even 1&emsp14;year     following the EHR implementation

PMID- 21685143   - The 2010 i2b2/VA Workshop on Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical       Records presented three tasks: a concept extraction task focused on the      extraction of medical concepts from patient reports; an assertion classification       task focused on assigning assertion types for medical problem concepts; and a      relation classification task focused on assigning relation types that hold      between medical problems, tests, and treatments  i2b2 and the VA provided an      annotated reference standard corpus for the three tasks  Using this reference      standard, 22 systems were developed for concept extraction, 21 for assertion      classification, and 16 for relation classification  These systems showed that      machine learning approaches could be augmented with rule-based systems to      determine concepts, assertions, and relations  Depending on the task, the      rule-based systems can either provide input for machine learning or post-process       the output of machine learning  Ensembles of classifiers, information from      unlabeled data, and external knowledge sources can help when the training data      are inadequate

PMID- 21685142   - Automation bias  AB --the tendency to over-rely on automation--has been studied      in various academic fields  Clinical decision support systems  CDSS  aim to      benefit the clinical decision-making process  Although most research shows      overall improved performance with use, there is often a failure to recognize the       new errors that CDSS can introduce  With a focus on healthcare, a systematic      review of the literature from a variety of research fields has been carried out,       assessing the frequency and severity of AB, the effect mediators, and      interventions potentially mitigating this effect  This is discussed alongside      automation-induced complacency, or insufficient monitoring of automation output        A mix of subject specific and freetext terms around the themes of automation,      human-automation interaction, and task performance and error were used to search       article databases  Of 13 821 retrieved papers, 74 met the inclusion criteria       User factors such as cognitive style, decision support systems  DSS , and task      specific experience mediated AB, as did attitudinal driving factors such as trust      and confidence  Environmental mediators included workload, task complexity, and      time constraint, which pressurized cognitive resources  Mitigators of AB included      implementation factors such as training and emphasizing user accountability, and       DSS design factors such as the position of advice on the screen, updated      confidence levels attached to DSS output, and the provision of information versus      recommendation  By uncovering the mechanisms by which AB operates, this review      aims to help optimize the clinical decision-making process for CDSS developers      and healthcare practitioners

PMID- 21680559   - OBJECTIVE: Clinical Queries filters were developed to improve the retrieval of      high-quality studies in searches on clinical matters  The study objective was to       determine the yield of relevant citations and physician satisfaction while      searching for diagnostic and treatment studies using the Clinical Queries page of      PubMed compared with searching PubMed without these filters  MATERIALS AND      METHODS: Forty practicing physicians, presented with standardized treatment and      diagnosis questions and one question of their choosing, entered search terms      which were processed in a random, blinded fashion through PubMed alone and PubMed      Clinical Queries  Participants rated search retrievals for applicability to the      question at hand and satisfaction  RESULTS: For treatment, the primary outcome of      retrieval of relevant articles was not significantly different between the      groups, but a higher proportion of articles from the Clinical Queries searches      met methodologic criteria  p=0 049 , and more articles were published in core      internal medicine journals  p=0 056   For diagnosis, the filtered results      returned more relevant articles  p=0 031  and fewer irrelevant articles  overall       retrieval less, p=0 023 ; participants needed to screen fewer articles before      arriving at the first relevant citation  p<0 05   Relevance was also influenced      by content terms used by participants in searching  Participants varied greatly      in their search performance  DISCUSSION: Clinical Queries filtered searches      returned more high-quality studies, though the retrieval of relevant articles was      only statistically different between the groups for diagnosis questions       CONCLUSION: Retrieving clinically important research studies from Medline is a      challenging task for physicians  Methodological search filters can improve search      retrieval

PMID- 21676941   - Unpredictable yet frequently occurring exception situations pervade clinical      care  Handling them properly often requires aberrant actions temporarily      departing from normal practice  In this study, the authors investigated several      exception-handling procedures provided in an electronic health records system for     facilitating clinical documentation, which the authors refer to as 'data entry      exit strategies ' Through a longitudinal analysis of computer-recorded usage      data, the authors found that  1  utilization of the exit strategies was not      affected by postimplementation system maturity or patient visit volume,      suggesting clinicians' needs to 'exit' unwanted situations are persistent; and       2  clinician type and gender are strong predictors of exit-strategy usage       Drilldown analyses further revealed that the exit strategies were judiciously      used and enabled actions that would be otherwise difficult or impossible       However, many data entries recorded via them could have been 'properly'      documented, yet were not, and a considerable proportion containing temporary or     incomplete information was never subsequently amended  These findings may have      significant implications for the design of safer and more user-friendly      point-of-care information systems for healthcare

PMID- 21676939   - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a low level of decision support within a hospital      computerized provider order entry system has an observable influence on the      medication ordering process on ward-rounds and to assess prescribers' views of      the decision support features  METHODS: 14 specialty teams  46 doctors  were      shadowed by the investigator while on their ward-rounds and 16 prescribers from      these teams were interviewed  RESULTS: Senior doctors were highly influential in       prescribing decisions during ward-rounds but rarely used the computerized      provider order entry system  Junior doctors entered the majority of medication      orders into the system, nearly always ignored computerized alerts and never     raised their occurrence with other doctors on ward-rounds  Interviews with      doctors revealed that some decision support features were valued but most were      not perceived to be useful  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The computerized alerts      failed to target the doctors who were making the prescribing decisions on      ward-rounds  Senior doctors were the decision makers, yet the junior doctors who       used the system received the alerts  As a result, the alert information was      generally ignored and not incorporated into the decision-making processes on      ward-rounds  The greatest value of decision support in this setting may be in      non-ward-round situations where senior doctors are less influential  Identifying       how prescribing systems are used during different clinical activities can guide      the design of decision support that effectively supports users in different      situations  If confirmed, the findings reported here present a specific focus and      user group for designers of medication decision support

PMID- 21676938   - OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug events  ADEs  are common and account for 770 000 injuries      and deaths each year and drug interactions account for as much as 30% of these      ADEs  Spontaneous reporting systems routinely collect ADEs from patients on      complex combinations of medications and provide an opportunity to discover     unexpected drug interactions  Unfortunately, current algorithms for such "signal       detection" are limited by underreporting of interactions that are not expected       We present a novel method to identify latent drug interaction signals in the case      of underreporting  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified eight clinically      significant adverse events  We used the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System to      build profiles for these adverse events based on the side effects of drugs known       to produce them  We then looked for pairs of drugs that match these single-drug      profiles in order to predict potential interactions  We evaluated these      interactions in two independent data sets and also through a retrospective      analysis of the Stanford Hospital electronic medical records  RESULTS: We      identified 171 novel drug interactions  for eight adverse event categories  that       are significantly enriched for known drug interactions  p=0 0009  and used the      electronic medical record for independently testing drug interaction hypotheses      using multivariate statistical models with covariates  CONCLUSION: Our method      provides an option for detecting hidden interactions in spontaneous reporting      systems by using side effect profiles to infer the presence of unreported adverse      events

PMID- 21672914   - Electronic personal health record systems  PHRs  support patient centered      healthcare by making medical records and other relevant information accessible to      patients, thus assisting patients in health self-management  We reviewed the      literature on PHRs including design, functionality, implementation, applications,      outcomes, and benefits  We found that, because primary care physicians play a key      role in patient health, PHRs are likely to be linked to physician electronic      medical record systems, so PHR adoption is dependent on growth in electronic      medical record adoption  Many PHR systems are physician-oriented, and do not      include patient-oriented functionalities  These must be provided to support      self-management and disease prevention if improvements in health outcomes are to       be expected  Differences in patient motivation to use PHRs exist, but an overall       low adoption rate is to be expected, except for the disabled, chronically ill, or     caregivers for the elderly  Finally, trials of PHR effectiveness and      sustainability for patient self-management are needed

PMID- 21672913   - It is widely accepted that content-based image retrieval  CBIR  can be extremely       useful for computer-aided diagnosis  CAD   However, CBIR has not been established      in clinical practice yet  As a widely unattended gap of integration, a unified      data concept for CBIR-based CAD results and reporting is lacking  Picture      archiving and communication systems and the workflow of radiologists must be      considered for successful data integration to be achieved  We suggest that CBIR     systems applied to CAD should integrate their results in a picture archiving and       communication systems environment such as Digital Imaging and Communications in      Medicine  DICOM  structured reporting documents  A sample DICOM structured      reporting template adaptable to CBIR and an appropriate integration scheme is      presented  The proposed CBIR data concept may foster the promulgation of CBIR     systems in clinical environments and, thereby, improve the diagnostic process

PMID- 21672912   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether statistical and machine-learning methods, when      applied to electronic health record  EHR  access data, could help identify      suspicious  ie, potentially inappropriate  access to EHRs  METHODS: From EHR     access logs and other organizational data collected over a 2-month period, the      authors extracted 26 features likely to be useful in detecting suspicious      accesses  Selected events were marked as either suspicious or appropriate by      privacy officers, and served as the gold standard set for model evaluation  The      authors trained logistic regression  LR  and support vector machine  SVM  models       on 10-fold cross-validation sets of 1291 labeled events  The authors evaluated      the sensitivity of final models on an external set of 58 events that were      identified as truly inappropriate and investigated independently from this study       using standard operating procedures  RESULTS: The area under the receiver     operating characteristic curve of the models on the whole data set of 1291 events      was 0 91 for LR, and 0 95 for SVM  The sensitivity of the baseline model on this       set was 0 8  When the final models were evaluated on the set of 58 investigated      events, all of which were determined as truly inappropriate, the sensitivity was       0 for the baseline method, 0 76 for LR, and 0 79 for SVM  LIMITATIONS: The LR and      SVM models may not generalize because of interinstitutional differences in      organizational structures, applications, and workflows  Nevertheless, our     approach for constructing the models using statistical and machine-learning      techniques can be generalized  An important limitation is the relatively small      sample used for the training set due to the effort required for its construction       CONCLUSION: The results suggest that statistical and machine-learning methods can      play an important role in helping privacy officers detect suspicious accesses to       EHRs

PMID- 21672911   - OBJECTIVE: To understand how the source of information affects different adverse       event  AE  surveillance methods  DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of inpatient      adverse drug events  ADEs  and hospital-associated infections  HAIs  detected by       either a computerized surveillance system  CSS  or manual chart review  MCR        MEASUREMENT: Descriptive analysis of events detected using the two methods by      type of AE, type of information about the AE, and sources of the information       RESULTS: CSS detected more HAIs than MCR  92% vs 34% ; however, a similar number       of ADEs was detected by both systems  52% vs 51%   The agreement between systems       was greater for HAIs than ADEs  26% vs 3%   The CSS missed events that did not      have information in coded format or that were described only in physician      narratives  The MCR detected events missed by CSS using information in physician       narratives  Discharge summaries were more likely to contain information about AEs      than any other type of physician narrative, followed by emergency department      reports for HAIs and general consult notes for ADEs  Some ADEs found by MCR were       detected by CSS but not verified by a clinician  LIMITATIONS: Inability to      distinguish between CSS false positives and suspected AEs for cases in which the       clinician did not document their assessment in the CSS  CONCLUSION: The effect      that information source has on different surveillance methods depends on the type      of AE  Integrating information from physician narratives with CSS using natural      language processing would improve the detection of ADEs more than HAIs

PMID- 21672910   - OBJECTIVE: The Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation  CHICA       system is a decision-support and electronic-medical-record system for pediatric      health maintenance and disease management  The purpose of this study was to      explore CHICA's ability to screen patients for disorders that have validated      screening criteria--specifically tuberculosis  TB  and iron-deficiency anemia       DESIGN: Children between 0 and 11 years were randomized by the CHICA system  In      the intervention group, parents were asked about TB and iron-deficiency risk, and      physicians received a tailored prompt  In the control group, no screens were      performed, and the physician received a generic prompt about these disorders       RESULTS: 1123 participants were randomized to the control group and 1116      participants to the intervention group  Significantly more people reported      positive risk factors for iron-deficiency anemia in the intervention group  17 5%      vs 3 1%, OR 6 6, 95% CI 4 5 to 9 5   In general, far fewer parents reported risk       factors for TB than for iron-deficiency anemia  Again, there were significantly      higher detection rates of positive risk factors in the intervention group  1 8%      vs 0 8%, OR 2 3, 95% CI 1 0 to 5 0   LIMITATIONS: It is possible that there may      be more positive screens without improving outcomes  However, the guidelines are       based on studies that have evaluated the questions the authors used as sensitive       and specific, and there is no reason to believe that parents misunderstood them        CONCLUSIONS: Many screening tests are risk-based, not universal, leaving      physicians to determine who should have a further workup  This can be a      time-consuming process  The authors demonstrated that the CHICA system performs      well in assessing risk automatically for TB and iron-deficiency anemia

PMID- 21672909   - OBJECTIVE: Uncovering the dominant molecular deregulation among the multitude of       pathways implicated in aggressive prostate cancer is essential to intelligently      developing targeted therapies  Paradoxically, published prostate cancer gene      expression signatures of poor prognosis share little overlap and thus do not      reveal shared mechanisms  The authors hypothesize that, by analyzing gene      signatures with quantitative models of protein-protein interactions, key pathways      will be elucidated and shown to be shared  DESIGN: The authors statistically      prioritized common interactors between established cancer genes and genes from      each prostate cancer signature of poor prognosis independently via a previously      validated single protein analysis of network  SPAN  methodology  Additionally,      they computationally identified pathways among the aggregated interactors across       signatures and validated them using a similarity metric and patient survival       MEASUREMENT: Using an information-theoretic metric, the authors assessed the      mechanistic similarity of the interactor signature  Its prognostic ability was      assessed in an independent cohort of 198 patients with high-Gleason prostate      cancer using Kaplan-Meier analysis  RESULTS: Of the 13 prostate cancer signatures      that were evaluated, eight interacted significantly with established cancer genes       false discovery rate <5%  and generated a 42-gene interactor signature that      showed the highest mechanistic similarity  p<0 0001   Via parameter-free      unsupervised classification, the interactor signature dichotomized the      independent prostate cancer cohort with a significant survival difference       p=0 009   Interpretation of the network not only recapitulated      phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, but also highlighted less well      established relevant pathways such as the Janus kinase 2 cascade  CONCLUSIONS:      SPAN methodology provides a robust means of abstracting disparate prostate cancer     gene expression signatures into clinically useful, prioritized pathways as well      as useful mechanistic pathways

PMID- 21672908   - OBJECTIVE: DNA biobanks linked to comprehensive electronic health records systems      are potentially powerful resources for pharmacogenetic studies  This study sought      to develop natural-language-processing algorithms to extract drug-dose      information from clinical text, and to assess the capabilities of such tools to      automate the data-extraction process for pharmacogenetic studies  MATERIALS AND      METHODS: A manually validated warfarin pharmacogenetic study identified a cohort       of 1125 patients with a stable warfarin dose, in which 776 patients were managed       by Coumadin Clinic physicians, and the remaining 349 patients were managed by      their providers  The authors developed two algorithms to extract weekly warfarin       doses from both data sets: a regular expression-based program for semistructured       Coumadin Clinic notes; and an advanced weekly dose calculator based on an      existing medication information extraction system  MedEx  for narrative      providers' notes  The authors then conducted an association analysis between an      automatically extracted stable weekly dose of warfarin and four genetic variants       of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes  The performance of the weekly dose-extraction program      was evaluated by comparing it with a gold standard containing manually curated      weekly doses  Precision, recall, F-measure, and overall accuracy were reported       Associations between known variants in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 and warfarin stable      weekly dose were performed with linear regression adjusted for age, gender, and      body mass index  RESULTS: The authors' evaluation showed that the MedEx-based      system could determine patients' warfarin weekly doses with 99 7% recall, 90 8%      precision, and 93 8% accuracy  Using the automatically extracted weekly doses of       warfarin, the authors successfully replicated the previous known associations      between warfarin stable dose and genetic variants in VKORC1 and CYP2C9

PMID- 21672907   - OBJECTIVE: Predicting patient outcomes from genome-wide measurements holds      significant promise for improving clinical care  The large number of measurements       eg, single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  , however, makes this task      computationally challenging  This paper evaluates the performance of an algorithm      that predicts patient outcomes from genome-wide data by efficiently model      averaging over an exponential number of naive Bayes  NB  models  DESIGN: This      model-averaged naive Bayes  MANB  method was applied to predict late onset      Alzheimer's disease in 1411 individuals who each had 312,318 SNP measurements      available as genome-wide predictive features  Its performance was compared to      that of a naive Bayes algorithm without feature selection  NB  and with feature      selection  FSNB   MEASUREMENT: Performance of each algorithm was measured in      terms of area under the ROC curve  AUC , calibration, and run time  RESULTS: The       training time of MANB  16 1 s  was fast like NB  15 6 s , while FSNB  1684 2 s       was considerably slower  Each of the three algorithms required less than 0 1 s to      predict the outcome of a test case  MANB had an AUC of 0 72, which is      significantly better than the AUC of 0 59 by NB  p<0 00001 , but not      significantly different from the AUC of 0 71 by FSNB  MANB was better calibrated       than NB, and FSNB was even better in calibration  A limitation was that only one       dataset and two comparison algorithms were included in this study  CONCLUSION:      MANB performed comparatively well in predicting a clinical outcome from a      high-dimensional genome-wide dataset  These results provide support for including      MANB in the methods used to predict outcomes from large, genome-wide datasets

PMID- 21659446   - OBJECTIVE: We have reported that implementation of an electronic health record       EHR  based quality improvement system that included point-of-care electronic      reminders accelerated improvement in performance for multiple measures of chronic      disease care and preventive care during a 1-year period  This study examined      whether providing pre-visit paper quality reminders could further improve      performance, especially for physicians whose performance had not improved much      during the first year  DESIGN: Time-series analysis at a large internal medicine       practice using a commercial EHR  All patients eligible for each measure were      included  range approximately 100-7500   MEASUREMENTS: The proportion of eligible      patients in the practice who satisfied each of 15 quality measures after removing      those with exceptions from the denominator  To analyze changes in performance for     individual physicians, two composite measures were used: prescribing seven      essential medications and completion of five preventive services  RESULTS: During      the year after implementing pre-encounter reminders, performance continued to      improve for eight measures, remained stable for four, and declined for three       Physicians with the worst performance at the start of the pre-encounter reminders      showed little absolute improvement over the next year, and most remained below      the median performance for physicians in the practice  CONCLUSIONS: Paper     pre-encounter reminders did not appear to improve performance beyond electronic      point-of-care reminders in the EHR alone  Lagging performance is likely not due      to providers' EHR workflow alone, and trying to step backwards and use paper     reminders in addition to point-of-care reminders in the EHR may not be an      effective strategy for engaging slow adopters

PMID- 21659444   - Evidence suggests that when carefully implemented, health information      technologies  HIT  have a positive impact on behavior, as well as operational,      process, and clinical outcomes  Recent economic stimulus initiatives have      prompted unprecedented federal investment in HIT  Despite strong interest from      the healthcare delivery community to achieve 'meaningful use' of HIT within a      relatively short time frame, few best-practice implementation methodologies have       been described  Herein we outline HIT implementation strategies at an academic      health center with an office of clinical transformation  Seven percent of the      medical center's information technology budget was dedicated to the Office of      Clinical Transformation, and successful conversion of 1491 physicians to      electronic-based documentation was accomplished  This paper outlines the process       re-design, end-user adoption, and practice transformation strategies that      resulted in a 99 7% adoption rate within 6&emsp14;months of the introduction of      digital documentation

PMID- 21622933   - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the usability of a health information exchange  HIE  in a       densely populated metropolitan region  This grant-funded HIE had been deployed      rapidly to address the imminent needs of the patient population and the need to      draw wider participation from regional entities  DESIGN: We conducted a      cross-sectional survey of individuals given access to the HIE at participating      organizations and examined some of the usability and usage factors related to the      technology acceptance model  MEASUREMENTS: We probed user perceptions using the      Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction, an author-generated Trust scale,      and user characteristic questions  eg, age, weekly system usage time   RESULTS:      Overall, users viewed the system favorably  ratings for all usability items were       greater than neutral  one-sample Wilcoxon test, p<0 0014, Bonferroni-corrected      for 35 tests   System usage was regressed on usability, trust, and demographic      and user characteristic factors  Three usability factors were positively      predictive of system usage: overall reactions  p<0 0 01 , learning  p<0 05 , and       system functionality  p<0 01   Although trust is an important component in      collaborative relationships, we did not find that user trust of other     participating healthcare entities was significantly predictive of usage  An      analysis of respondents' comments revealed ways to improve the HIE  CONCLUSION:      We used a rapid deployment model to develop an HIE and found that perceptions of       system usability were positive  We also found that system usage was predicted      well by some aspects of usability  Results from this study suggest that a rapid      development approach may serve as a viable model for developing usable HIEs      serving communities with limited resources

PMID- 21613642   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of the structure and code sets specified in      the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Structured and Codified Sig      Format to represent ambulatory electronic prescriptions  DESIGN: We parsed the      Sig strings from a sample of 20,161 de-identified ambulatory e-prescriptions into      variables representing the fields of the Structured and Codified Sig Format  A      stratified random sample of these representations was then reviewed by a group of      experts  For codified Sig fields, we attempted to map the actual words used by      prescribers to the equivalent terms in the designated terminology  MEASUREMENTS:       Proportion of prescriptions that the Format could fully represent; proportion of       terms used that could be mapped to the designated terminology  RESULTS: The      fields defined in the Format could fully represent 95% of Sigs  95% CI 93% to      97% , but ambiguities were identified, particularly in representing multiple-step      instructions  The terms used by prescribers could be codified for only 60% of      dose delivery methods, 84% of dose forms, 82% of vehicles, 95% of routes, 70% of       sites, 33% of administration timings, and 93% of indications  LIMITATIONS: The      findings are based on a retrospective sample of ambulatory prescriptions derived       mostly from primary care physicians  CONCLUSION: The fields defined in the Format      could represent most of the patient instructions in a large prescription sample,       but prior to its mandatory adoption, further work is needed to ensure that      potential ambiguities are addressed and that a complete set of terms is available      for the codified fields

PMID- 21613641   - We developed an accurate and valid medication order algorithm to identify from      electronic health records the definitive medication order intended for dispensing      and applied this process to identify a cohort of patients and to stratify them      into one of three medication adherence groups: early non-persistence, primary      non-adherence, or ongoing adherence  We identified medication order data from      electronic health record tables, obtained the orders, and linked the orders to      dispensings  These steps were then used to identify patients newly prescribed      antihypertensive, antidiabetic, or antihyperlipidemic medications and to      determine the adherence group of each patient  Record review validated each      process step, thus increasing the accuracy of group assignment as well as the      criteria used to select patients  This work is an important first step to      accurately identify study-specific patient adherence cohorts and allow more      comprehensive estimates of population medication adherence

PMID- 21613640   - BACKGROUND: Due to the high cost of manual curation of key aspects from the      scientific literature, automated methods for assisting this process are greatly      desired  Here, we report a novel approach to facilitate MeSH indexing, a      challenging task of assigning MeSH terms to MEDLINE citations for their archiving      and retrieval  METHODS: Unlike previous methods for automatic MeSH term      assignment, we reformulate the indexing task as a ranking problem such that      relevant MeSH headings are ranked higher than those irrelevant ones       Specifically, for each document we retrieve 20 neighbor documents, obtain a list       of MeSH main headings from neighbors, and rank the MeSH main headings using      ListNet-a learning-to-rank algorithm  We trained our algorithm on 200 documents      and tested on a previously used benchmark set of 200 documents and a larger     dataset of 1000 documents  RESULTS: Tested on the benchmark dataset, our method      achieved a precision of 0 390, recall of 0 712, and mean average precision  MAP        of 0 626  In comparison to the state of the art, we observe statistically      significant improvements as large as 39% in MAP  p-value <0 001   Similar     significant improvements were also obtained on the larger document set       CONCLUSION: Experimental results show that our approach makes the most accurate      MeSH predictions to date, which suggests its great potential in making a      practical impact on MeSH indexing  Furthermore, as discussed the proposed      learning framework is robust and can be adapted to many other similar tasks      beyond MeSH indexing in the biomedical domain  All data sets are available at:      http://www ncbi nlm nih gov/CBBresearch/Lu/indexing

PMID- 21606134   - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated algorithms commonly used in syndromic      surveillance for use as screening tools to detect potentially clonal outbreaks      for review by infection control practitioners  DESIGN: Study phase 1 applied four     aberrancy detection algorithms  CUSUM, EWMA, space-time scan statistic, and      WSARE  to retrospective microbiologic culture data, producing a list of past      candidate outbreak clusters  In phase 2, four infectious disease physicians      categorized the phase 1 algorithm-identified clusters to ascertain algorithm      performance  In phase 3, project members combined the algorithms to create a      unified screening system and conducted a retrospective pilot evaluation       MEASUREMENTS: The study calculated recall and precision for each algorithm, and      created precision-recall curves for various methods of combining the algorithms      into a unified screening tool  RESULTS: Individual algorithm recall and precision      ranged from 0 21 to 0 31 and from 0 053 to 0 29, respectively  Few candidate      outbreak clusters were identified by more than one algorithm  The best method of       combining the algorithms yielded an area under the precision-recall curve of      0 553  The phase 3 combined system detected all infection control-confirmed      outbreaks during the retrospective evaluation period  LIMITATIONS: Lack of phase       2 reviewers' agreement indicates that subjective expert review was an imperfect      gold standard  Less conservative filtering of culture results and alternate      parameter selection for each algorithm might have improved algorithm performance       CONCLUSION: Hospital outbreak detection presents different challenges than      traditional syndromic surveillance  Nevertheless, algorithms developed for     syndromic surveillance have potential to form the basis of a combined system that      might perform clinically useful hospital outbreak screening

PMID- 21597105   - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the approaches the authors developed while      participating in the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge to automatically extract medical      concepts and annotate assertions on concepts and relations between concepts       DESIGN: The authors'approaches rely on both rule-based and machine-learning      methods  Natural language processing is used to extract features from the input      texts; these features are then used in the authors' machine-learning approaches        The authors used Conditional Random Fields for concept extraction, and Support      Vector Machines for assertion and relation annotation  Depending on the task, the      authors tested various combinations of rule-based and machine-learning methods       RESULTS: The authors'assertion annotation system obtained an F-measure of 0 931,       ranking fifth out of 21 participants at the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge  The authors'       relation annotation system ranked third out of 16 participants with a 0 709      F-measure  The 0 773 F-measure the authors obtained on concept extraction did not      make it to the top 10  CONCLUSION: On the one hand, the authors confirm that the       use of only machine-learning methods is highly dependent on the annotated      training data, and thus obtained better results for well-represented classes  On       the other hand, the use of only a rule-based method was not sufficient to deal      with new types of data  Finally, the use of hybrid approaches combining      machine-learning and rule-based approaches yielded higher scores

PMID- 21597104   - BACKGROUND: Systematic study of clinical phenotypes is important for a better     understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases and more effective      gene-based disease management  A key aspect in facilitating such studies requires      standardized representation of the phenotype data using common data elements       CDEs  and controlled biomedical vocabularies  In this study, the authors      analyzed how a limited subset of phenotypic data is amenable to common definition      and standardized collection, as well as how their adoption in large-scale      epidemiological and genome-wide studies can significantly facilitate cross-study       analysis  METHODS: The authors mapped phenotype data dictionaries from five      different eMERGE  Electronic Medical Records and Genomics  Network sites studying      multiple diseases such as peripheral arterial disease and type 2 diabetes  For     mapping, standardized terminological and metadata repository resources, such as      the caDSR  Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository  and SNOMED CT       Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine , were used  The mapping process comprised      both lexical  via searching for relevant pre-coordinated concepts and data      elements  and semantic  via post-coordination  techniques  Where feasible, new      data elements were curated to enhance the coverage during mapping  A web-based      application was also developed to uniformly represent and query the mapped data      elements from different eMERGE studies  RESULTS: Approximately 60% of the target       data elements  95 out of 157  could be mapped using simple lexical analysis      techniques on pre-coordinated terms and concepts before any additional curation      of terminology and metadata resources was initiated by eMERGE investigators       After curation of 54 new caDSR CDEs and nine new NCI thesaurus concepts and using      post-coordination, the authors were able to map the remaining 40% of data      elements to caDSR and SNOMED CT  A web-based tool was also implemented to assist       in semi-automatic mapping of data elements  CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the      requirement for standardized representation of clinical research data using      existing metadata and terminology resources and provides simple techniques and      software for data element mapping using experiences from the eMERGE Network

PMID- 21571747   - OBJECTIVE: At present, most clinical data are exchanged between organizations      within a regional system  However, people traveling abroad may need to visit a      hospital, which would make international exchange of clinical data very useful       BACKGROUND: Since 2007, a collaborative effort to achieve clinical data sharing      has been carried out at Zhejiang University in China and Kyoto University and      Miyazaki University in Japan; each is running a regional clinical information      center  Methods An international layer system named Global Dolphin was      constructed with several key services, sharing patients' health information      between countries using a medical markup language  MML   The system was piloted      with 39 test patients  RESULTS: The three regions above have records for 966,000       unique patients, which are available through Global Dolphin  Data exchanged      successfully from Japan to China for the 39 study patients include 1001 MML files      and 152 images  The MML files contained 197 free text-type paragraphs that needed      human translation  Discussion The pilot test in Global Dolphin demonstrates that       patient information can be shared across countries through international health      data exchange  To achieve cross-border sharing of clinical data, some key issues       had to be addressed: establishment of a super directory service across countries;      data transformation; and unique one-language translation  Privacy protection was       also taken into account  The system is now ready for live use  CONCLUSION: The      project demonstrates a means of achieving worldwide accessibility of medical      data, by which the integrity and continuity of patients' health information can      be maintained

PMID- 21571746   - BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support systems can prevent knowledge-based      prescription errors and improve patient outcomes  The clinical effectiveness of      these systems, however, is substantially limited by poor user acceptance of      presented warnings  To enhance alert acceptance it may be useful to quantify the       impact of potential modulators of acceptance  METHODS: We built a logistic      regression model to predict alert acceptance of drug-drug interaction  DDI       alerts in three different settings  Ten variables from the clinical and human      factors literature were evaluated as potential modulators of provider alert      acceptance  ORs were calculated for the impact of knowledge quality, alert      display, textual information, prioritization, setting, patient age,      dose-dependent toxicity, alert frequency, alert level, and required      acknowledgment on acceptance of the DDI alert  RESULTS: 50,788 DDI alerts were      analyzed  Providers accepted only 1 4% of non-interruptive alerts  For     interruptive alerts, user acceptance positively correlated with frequency of the       alert  OR 1 30, 95% CI 1 23 to 1 38 , quality of display  4 75, 3 87 to 5 84 ,      and alert level  1 74, 1 63 to 1 86   Alert acceptance was higher in inpatients       2 63, 2 32 to 2 97  and for drugs with dose-dependent toxicity  1 13, 1 07 to      1 21   The textual information influenced the mode of reaction and providers were      more likely to modify the prescription if the message contained detailed advice      on how to manage the DDI  CONCLUSION: We evaluated potential modulators of alert       acceptance by assessing content and human factors issues, and quantified the      impact of a number of specific factors which influence alert acceptance  This      information may help improve clinical decision support systems design

PMID- 21565856   - OBJECTIVE: As clinical text mining continues to mature, its potential as an      enabling technology for innovations in patient care and clinical research is      becoming a reality  A critical part of that process is rigid benchmark testing of      natural language processing methods on realistic clinical narrative  In this      paper, the authors describe the design and performance of three state-of-the-art       text-mining applications from the National Research Council of Canada on      evaluations within the 2010 i2b2 challenge  DESIGN: The three systems perform      three key steps in clinical information extraction:  1  extraction of medical      problems, tests, and treatments, from discharge summaries and progress notes;  2       classification of assertions made on the medical problems;  3  classification of       relations between medical concepts  Machine learning systems performed these      tasks using large-dimensional bags of features, as derived from both the text      itself and from external sources: UMLS, cTAKES, and Medline  MEASUREMENTS:      Performance was measured per subtask, using micro-averaged F-scores, as      calculated by comparing system annotations with ground-truth annotations on a      test set  RESULTS: The systems ranked high among all submitted systems in the      competition, with the following F-scores: concept extraction 0 8523  ranked      first ; assertion detection 0 9362  ranked first ; relationship detection 0 7313        ranked second   CONCLUSION: For all tasks, we found that the introduction of a      wide range of features was crucial to success  Importantly, our choice of machine      learning algorithms allowed us to be versatile in our feature design, and to      introduce a large number of features without overfitting and without encountering      computing-resource bottlenecks

PMID- 21561873   - Nearly a decade since the completion of the first draft of the human genome, the       biomedical community is positioned to usher in a new era of scientific inquiry      that links fundamental biological insights with clinical knowledge  Accordingly,       holistic approaches are needed to develop and assess hypotheses that incorporate       genotypic, phenotypic, and environmental knowledge  This perspective presents      translational bioinformatics as a discipline that builds on the successes of      bioinformatics and health informatics for the study of complex diseases  The      early successes of translational bioinformatics are indicative of the potential      to achieve the promise of the Human Genome Project for gaining deeper insights to      the genetic underpinnings of disease and progress toward the development of a new      generation of therapies

PMID- 21531703   - BACKGROUND: The electronic exchange of health information among healthcare      providers has the potential to produce enormous clinical benefits and financial      savings, although realizing that potential will be challenging  The American      Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will reward providers for 'meaningful use'       of electronic health records, including participation in clinical data exchange,       but the best ways to do so remain uncertain  METHODS: We analyzed patient visits       in one community in which a high proportion of providers were using an electronic      health record and participating in data exchange  Using claims data from one      large private payer for individuals under age 65 years, we computed the number of      visits to a provider which involved transitions in care from other providers as a      percentage of total visits  We calculated this 'transition percentage' for     individual providers and medical groups  RESULTS: On average, excluding radiology      and pathology, approximately 51% of visits involved care transitions between      individual providers in the community and 36%-41% involved transitions between      medical groups  There was substantial variation in transition percentage across      medical specialties, within specialties and across medical groups  Specialists      tended to have higher transition percentages and smaller ranges within specialty       than primary care physicians, who ranged from 32% to 95%  including transitions      involving radiology and pathology   The transition percentages of pediatric      practices were similar to those of adult primary care, except that many      transitions occurred among pediatric physicians within a single medical group       CONCLUSIONS: Care transition patterns differed substantially by type of practice       and should be considered in designing incentives to foster providers' meaningful       use of health data exchange services

PMID- 21527407   - OBJECTIVE: To identify ways for improving the consistency of design, conduct, and      results reporting of time and motion  T&M  research in health informatics       MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the commonalities and divergences of empirical      studies published 1990-2010 that have applied the T&M approach to examine the      impact of health IT implementation on clinical work processes and workflow  The      analysis led to the development of a suggested 'checklist' intended to help      future T&M research produce compatible and comparable results  We call this      checklist STAMP  Suggested Time And Motion Procedures   RESULTS: STAMP outlines a      minimum set of 29 data/ information elements organized into eight key areas, plus      three supplemental elements contained in an 'Ancillary Data' area, that      researchers may consider collecting and reporting in their future T&M endeavors        DISCUSSION: T&M is generally regarded as the most reliable approach for assessing      the impact of health IT implementation on clinical work  However, there exist      considerable inconsistencies in how previous T&M studies were conducted and/or     how their results were reported, many of which do not seem necessary yet can have      a significant impact on quality of research and generalisability of results       Therefore, we deem it is time to call for standards that can help improve the      consistency of T&M research in health informatics  This study represents an      initial attempt  CONCLUSION: We developed a suggested checklist to improve the      methodological and results reporting consistency of T&M research, so that      meaningful insights can be derived from across-study synthesis and health      informatics, as a field, will be able to accumulate knowledge from these studies

PMID- 21515545   - OBJECTIVES:  a  To determine the extent and range of errors and issues in the      Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms  SNOMED CT  hierarchies as      they affect two practical projects   b  To determine the origin of issues raised       and propose methods to address them  METHODS: The hierarchies for concepts in the      Core Problem List Subset published by the Unified Medical Language System were      examined for their appropriateness in two applications  Anomalies were traced to       their source to determine whether they were simple local errors, systematic      inferences propagated by SNOMED's classification process, or the result of      problems with SNOMED's schemas  Conclusions were confirmed by showing that      altering the root cause and reclassifying had the intended effects, and not      others  MAIN RESULTS: Major problems were encountered, involving concepts central      to medicine including myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypertension  Most of       the issues raised were systematic  Some exposed fundamental errors in SNOMED's      schemas, particularly with regards to anatomy  In many cases, the root cause      could only be identified and corrected with the aid of a classifier  LIMITATIONS:      This is a preliminary 'experiment of opportunity ' The results are not      exhaustive; nor is consensus on all points definitive  CONCLUSIONS: The SNOMED CT      hierarchies cannot be relied upon in their present state in our applications       However, systematic quality assurance and correction are possible and practical      but require sound techniques analogous to software engineering and combined      lexical and semantic techniques  Until this is done, anyone using SNOMED codes      should exercise caution  Errors in the hierarchies, or attempts to compensate for     them, are likely to compromise interoperability and meaningful use

PMID- 21515544   - OBJECTIVE: In the 6 years since the National Library of Medicine began monthly      releases of RxNorm, RxNorm has become a central resource for communicating about       clinical drugs and supporting interoperation between drug vocabularies  MATERIALS      AND METHODS: Built on the idea of a normalized name for a medication at a given      level of abstraction, RxNorm provides a set of names and relationships based on      11 different external source vocabularies  The standard model enables decision      support to take place for a variety of uses at the appropriate level of      abstraction  With the incorporation of National Drug File Reference Terminology       NDF-RT  from the Veterans Administration, even more sophisticated decision      support has become possible  DISCUSSION: While related products such as RxTerms,       RxNav, MyMedicationList, and MyRxPad have been recognized as helpful for various       uses, tasks such as identifying exactly what is and is not on the market remain a      challenge

PMID- 21515543   - OBJECTIVE: As biomedical technology becomes increasingly sophisticated,      researchers can probe ever more subtle effects with the added requirement that      the investigation of small effects often requires the acquisition of large      amounts of data  In biomedicine, these data are often acquired at, and later     shared between, multiple sites  There are both technological and sociological      hurdles to be overcome for data to be passed between researchers and later made      accessible to the larger scientific community  The goal of the Biomedical      Informatics Research Network  BIRN  is to address the challenges inherent in      biomedical data sharing  MATERIALS AND METHODS: BIRN tools are grouped into      'capabilities' and are available in the areas of data management, data security,       information integration, and knowledge engineering  BIRN has a user-driven focus       and employs a layered architectural approach that promotes reuse of      infrastructure  BIRN tools are designed to be modular and therefore can work with      pre-existing tools  BIRN users can choose the capabilities most useful for their       application, while not having to ensure that their project conforms to a      monolithic architecture  RESULTS: BIRN has implemented a new software-based      data-sharing infrastructure that has been put to use in many different domains      within biomedicine  BIRN is actively involved in outreach to the broader     biomedical community to form working partnerships  CONCLUSION: BIRN's mission is       to provide capabilities and services related to data sharing to the biomedical      research community  It does this by forming partnerships and solving specific,      user-driven problems whose solutions are then available for use by other groups

PMID- 21515542   - OBJECTIVE: To describe a system for determining the assertion status of medical      problems mentioned in clinical reports, which was entered in the 2010 i2b2/VA      community evaluation 'Challenges in natural language processing for clinical      data' for the task of classifying assertions associated with problem concepts      extracted from patient records  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combination of machine      learning  conditional random field and maximum entropy  and rule-based  pattern      matching  techniques was used to detect negation, speculation, and hypothetical      and conditional information, as well as information associated with persons other     than the patient  RESULTS: The best submission obtained an overall micro-averaged      F-score of 0 9343  CONCLUSIONS: Using semantic attributes of concepts and      information about document structure as features for statistical classification      of assertions is a good way to leverage rule-based and statistical techniques  In      this task, the choice of features may be more important than the choice of      classifier algorithm

PMID- 21508414   - OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to develop and evaluate machine-learning-based      approaches to extracting clinical entities-including medical problems, tests, and      treatments, as well as their asserted status-from hospital discharge summaries      written using natural language  This project was part of the 2010 Center of      Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside/Veterans Affairs  VA       natural-language-processing challenge  DESIGN: The authors implemented a      machine-learning-based named entity recognition system for clinical text and      systematically evaluated the contributions of different types of features and ML       algorithms, using a training corpus of 349 annotated notes  Based on the results       from training data, the authors developed a novel hybrid clinical entity      extraction system, which integrated heuristic rule-based modules with the ML-base      named entity recognition module  The authors applied the hybrid system to the      concept extraction and assertion classification tasks in the challenge and      evaluated its performance using a test data set with 477 annotated notes       MEASUREMENTS: Standard measures including precision, recall, and F-measure were      calculated using the evaluation script provided by the Center of Informatics for       Integrating Biology and the Bedside/VA challenge organizers  The overall      performance for all three types of clinical entities and all six types of      assertions across 477 annotated notes were considered as the primary metric in      the challenge  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Systematic evaluation on the training set       showed that Conditional Random Fields outperformed Support Vector Machines, and      semantic information from existing natural-language-processing systems largely      improved performance, although contributions from different types of features      varied  The authors' hybrid entity extraction system achieved a maximum overall      F-score of 0 8391 for concept extraction  ranked second  and 0 9313 for assertion      classification  ranked fourth, but not statistically different than the first      three systems  on the test data set in the challenge

PMID- 21498805   - OBJECTIVE: Accurate, understandable public health information is important for     ensuring the health of the nation  The large portion of the US population with      Limited English Proficiency is best served by translations of public-health      information into other languages  However, a large number of health departments      and primary care clinics face significant barriers to fulfilling federal mandates      to provide multilingual materials to Limited English Proficiency individuals       This article presents a pilot study on the feasibility of using freely available       statistical machine translation technology to translate health promotion      materials  DESIGN: The authors gathered health-promotion materials in English      from local and national public-health websites  Spanish versions were created by       translating the documents using a freely available machine-translation website       Translations were rated for adequacy and fluency, analyzed for errors, manually      corrected by a human posteditor, and compared with exclusively manual      translations  RESULTS: Machine translation plus postediting took 15-53 min per     document, compared to the reported days or even weeks for the standard      translation process  A blind comparison of machine-assisted and human      translations of six documents revealed overall equivalency between      machine-translated and manually translated materials  The analysis of translation      errors indicated that the most important errors were word-sense errors       CONCLUSION: The results indicate that machine translation plus postediting may be      an effective method of producing multilingual health materials with equivalent      quality but lower cost compared to manual translations

PMID- 21486890   - Case report forms  CRFs  are used for structured-data collection in clinical      research studies  Existing CRF-related standards encompass structural features of      forms and data items, content standards, and specifications for using      terminologies  This paper reviews existing standards and discusses their current       limitations  Because clinical research is highly protocol-specific,      forms-development processes are more easily standardized than is CRF content       Tools that support retrieval and reuse of existing items will enable standards      adoption in clinical research applications  Such tools will depend upon formal      relationships between items and terminological standards  Future standards      adoption will depend upon standardized approaches for bridging generic structural      standards and domain-specific content standards  Clinical research informatics      can help define tools requirements in terms of workflow support for research      activities, reconcile the perspectives of varied clinical research stakeholders,       and coordinate standards efforts toward interoperability across healthcare and      research data collection

PMID- 21486889   - Serious medication errors occur commonly in the period after hospital discharge        Medication reconciliation in the postdischarge ambulatory setting may be one way       to reduce the frequency of these errors  The authors describe the design and      implementation of a novel tool built into an ambulatory electronic medical record       EMR  to facilitate postdischarge medication reconciliation  The tool compares      the preadmission medication list within the ambulatory EMR to the hospital      discharge medication list, highlights all changes, and allows the EMR medication       list to be easily updated  As might be expected for a novel tool intended for use      in a minority of visits, use of the tool was low at first: 20% of applicable      patient visits within 30&emsp14;days of discharge  Clinician outreach, education,      and a pop-up reminder succeeded in increasing use to 41% of applicable visits       Review of feedback identified several usability issues that will inform      subsequent versions of the tool and provide generalizable lessons for how best to      design medication reconciliation tools for this setting

PMID- 21486888   - OBJECTIVE: Many healthcare organizations  HCOs  including Kaiser Permanente,      Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Medical Center, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, provide      access to online health communities as part of their overall patient support      services  The key objective in establishing and running these online health      communities is to offer empathic support to patients  Patients' perceived empathy      is considered to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing      patient's compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing  Most      online health communities are characterized by two main functions: informational       support and social support  This study examines the relative impact of these two       distinct functions-that is, as an information seeking forum and as a social      support forum-on patients' perceived empathy in online health communities       DESIGN: This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the above      functions of online health communities-information seeking effectiveness and      perceived social support-on perceived empathy  The model also incorporates the      potential moderating effect of homophily on these relationships  MEASUREMENTS: A       web-based survey was used to collect data from members of the online health      communities provided by three major healthcare centers  A regression technique      was used to analyze the data to test the hypotheses  RESULTS: The study finds      that it is the information seeking effectiveness rather than the social support      which affects patient's perceived empathy in online health communities run by      HCOs  The results indicate that HCOs that provide online health communities for     their patients need to focus more on developing tools that will make information       seeking more effective and efficient

PMID- 21486887   - OBJECTIVE: A full-text search engine can be a useful tool for augmenting the      reuse value of unstructured narrative data stored in electronic health records       EHR   A prominent barrier to the effective utilization of such tools originates       from users' lack of search expertise and/or medical-domain knowledge  To mitigate      the issue, the authors experimented with a 'collaborative search' feature through      a homegrown EHR search engine that allows users to preserve their search      knowledge and share it with others  This feature was inspired by the success of      many social information-foraging techniques used on the web that leverage users'       collective wisdom to improve the quality and efficiency of information retrieval       DESIGN: The authors conducted an empirical evaluation study over a 4-year period       The user sample consisted of 451 academic researchers, medical practitioners, and      hospital administrators  The data were analyzed using a social-network analysis      to delineate the structure of the user collaboration networks that mediated the      diffusion of knowledge of search  RESULTS: The users embraced the concept with      considerable enthusiasm  About half of the EHR searches processed by the system       0 44 million  were based on stored search knowledge; 0 16 million utilized      shared knowledge made available by other users  The social-network analysis      results also suggest that the user-collaboration networks engendered by the      collaborative search feature played an instrumental role in enabling the transfer     of search knowledge across people and domains  CONCLUSION: Applying collaborative      search, a social information-foraging technique popularly used on the web, may      provide the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of information      retrieval in healthcare

PMID- 21486885   - OBJECTIVE: To examine variation in the adoption of electronic health record  EHR       functionalities and their use patterns, barriers to adoption, and perceived      benefits by physician practice size  DESIGN: Mailed survey of a nationally      representative random sample of practicing physicians identified from the      Physician Masterfile of the American Medical Association  Measurements We      measured, stratified by practice size:  1  availability of EHR functionalities,       2  functionality use,  3  barriers to the adoption and use of EHR, and  4       impact of the EHR on the practice and quality of patient care  RESULTS: With a      response rate of 62%, we found that < 2% of physicians in solo or two-physician       small  practices reported a fully functional EHR and 5% reported a basic EHR     compared with 13% of physicians from 11+ group  largest group  practices with a      fully functional system and 26% with a basic system  Between groups, a 21-46%      difference in specific functionalities available was reported  Among adopters      there were moderate to large differences in the use of the EHR systems  Financial      barriers were more likely to be reported by smaller practices, along with      concerns about future obsolescence  These differences were sizable  13-16%  and      statistically significant  p < 0 001   All adopters reported similar benefits       Limitations Although we have adjusted for response bias, influences may still      exist  CONCLUSION: Our study found that physicians in small practices have lower       levels of EHR adoption and that these providers were less likely to use these      systems  Ensuring that unique barriers are addressed will be critical to the      widespread meaningful use of EHR systems among small practices

PMID- 21486883   - OBJECTIVE: To model how individual violations in routine clinical processes      cumulatively contribute to the risk of adverse events in hospital using an      agent-based simulation framework  DESIGN: An agent-based simulation was designed       to model the cascade of common violations that contribute to the risk of adverse       events in routine clinical processes  Clinicians and the information systems that      support them were represented as a group of interacting agents using data from      direct observations  The model was calibrated using data from 101 patient      transfers observed in a hospital and results were validated for one of two      scenarios  a misidentification scenario and an infection control scenario        Repeated simulations using the calibrated model were undertaken to create a      distribution of possible process outcomes  The likelihood of end-of-chain risk is      the main outcome measure, reported for each of the two scenarios  RESULTS: The      simulations demonstrate end-of-chain risks of 8% and 24% for the      misidentification and infection control scenarios, respectively  Over 95% of the       simulations in both scenarios are unique, indicating that the in-patient transfer     process diverges from prescribed work practices in a variety of ways       CONCLUSIONS: The simulation allowed us to model the risk of adverse events in a      clinical process, by generating the variety of possible work subject to      violations, a novel prospective risk analysis method  The in-patient transfer     process has a high proportion of unique trajectories, implying that risk      mitigation may benefit from focusing on reducing complexity rather than      augmenting the process with further rule-based protocols

PMID- 21486881   - OBJECTIVE: Public health surveillance requires outbreak detection algorithms with      computational efficiency sufficient to handle the increasing volume of disease      surveillance data  In response to this need, the authors propose a spatial      clustering algorithm, rank-based spatial clustering  RSC , that detects rapidly      infectious but non-contagious disease outbreaks  DESIGN: The authors compared the      outbreak-detection performance of RSC with that of three well established      algorithms-the wavelet anomaly detector  WAD , the spatial scan statistic  KSS ,       and the Bayesian spatial scan statistic  BSS -using real disease surveillance      data on to which they superimposed simulated disease outbreaks  MEASUREMENTS: The      following outbreak-detection performance metrics were measured: receiver     operating characteristic curve, activity monitoring operating curve curve,      cluster positive predictive value, cluster sensitivity, and algorithm run time       RESULTS: RSC was computationally efficient  It outperformed the other two spatial      algorithms in terms of detection timeliness, and outbreak localization  RSC also       had overall better timeliness than the time-series algorithm WAD at low false      alarm rates  CONCLUSION: RSC is an ideal algorithm for analyzing large datasets      when the application of other spatial algorithms is not practical  It also allows      timely investigation for public health practitioners by providing early detection      and well-localized outbreak clusters

PMID- 21486880   - BACKGROUND: Providers have been reluctant to disclose patient data for     public-health purposes  Even if patient privacy is ensured, the desire to protect      provider confidentiality has been an important driver of this reluctance       METHODS: Six requirements for a surveillance protocol were defined that satisfy      the confidentiality needs of providers and ensure utility to public health  The      authors developed a secure multi-party computation protocol using the Paillier     cryptosystem to allow the disclosure of stratified case counts and denominators      to meet these requirements  The authors evaluated the protocol in a simulated      environment on its computation performance and ability to detect disease outbreak      clusters  RESULTS: Theoretical and empirical assessments demonstrate that all      requirements are met by the protocol  A system implementing the protocol scales      linearly in terms of computation time as the number of providers is increased       The absolute time to perform the computations was 12 5&emsp14;s for data from      3000 practices  This is acceptable performance, given that the reporting would      normally be done at 24&emsp14;h intervals  The accuracy of detection disease      outbreak cluster was unchanged compared with a non-secure distributed      surveillance protocol, with an F-score higher than 0 92 for outbreaks involving      500 or more cases  CONCLUSION: The protocol and associated software provide a      practical method for providers to disclose patient data for sentinel, syndromic      or other indicator-based surveillance while protecting patient privacy and the      identity of individual providers

PMID- 21486876   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a theoretically informed and empirically validated survey      instrument for assessing prescribers' perception of computerized drug-drug      interaction  DDI  alerts  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey is grounded in the      unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and an adapted accident      causation model  Development of the instrument was also informed by a review of      the extant literature on prescribers' attitude toward computerized medication      safety alerts and common prescriber-provided reasons for overriding  To refine      and validate the survey, we conducted a two-stage empirical validation study      consisting of a pretest with a panel of domain experts followed by a field test      among all eligible prescribers at our institution  RESULTS: The resulting survey       instrument contains 28 questionnaire items assessing six theoretical dimensions:       performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating      conditions, perceived fatigue, and perceived use behavior  Satisfactory results      were obtained from the field validation; however, a few potential issues were      also identified  We analyzed these issues accordingly and the results led to the       final survey instrument as well as usage recommendations  DISCUSSION: High      override rates of computerized medication safety alerts have been a prevalent      problem  They are usually caused by, or manifested in, issues of poor end user     acceptance  However, standardized research tools for assessing and understanding       end users' perception are currently lacking, which inhibits knowledge      accumulation and consequently forgoes improvement opportunities  The survey      instrument presented in this paper may help fill this methodological gap       CONCLUSION: We developed and empirically validated a survey instrument that may      be useful for future research on DDI alerts and other types of computerized      medication safety alerts more generally

PMID- 21474623   - We review the scholarly career of our colleague, Marco Ramoni, who died      unexpectedly in the summer of 2010  His work mainly explored the development and       application of Bayesian techniques to model clinical, public health, and      bioinformatics questions  His contributions have led to improvements in our     ability to model behavior that evolves in time, to explore systematic      relationships among large sets of covariates, and to tease out the meaning of      data on the role of genetic variation in the genesis of important diseases

PMID- 21459927   - OBJECTIVE: The long-term goal of this work is the automated discovery of      anaphoric relations from the clinical narrative  The creation of a gold standard       set from a cross-institutional corpus of clinical notes and high-level      characteristics of that gold standard are described  METHODS: A standard      methodology for annotation guideline development, gold standard annotations, and       inter-annotator agreement  IAA  was used  RESULTS: The gold standard annotations       resulted in 7214 markables, 5992 pairs, and 1304 chains  Each report averaged 40       anaphoric markables, 33 pairs, and seven chains  The overall IAA is high on the      Mayo dataset  0 6607 , and moderate on the University of Pittsburgh Medical      Center  UPMC  dataset  0 4072   The IAA between each annotator and the gold      standard is high  Mayo: 0 7669, 0 7697, and 0 9021; UPMC: 0 6753 and 0 7138        These results imply a quality corpus feasible for system development  They also      suggest the complementary nature of the annotations performed by the experts and       the importance of an annotator team with diverse knowledge backgrounds       LIMITATIONS: Only one of the annotators had the linguistic background necessary      for annotation of the linguistic attributes  The overall generalizability of the       guidelines will be further strengthened by annotations of data from additional      sites  This will increase the overall corpus size and the representation of each       relation type  CONCLUSION: The first step toward the development of an anaphoric       relation resolver as part of a comprehensive natural language processing system      geared specifically for the clinical narrative in the electronic medical record      is described  The deidentified annotated corpus will be available to researchers

PMID- 21447497   - OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that the medication lists of patients are often      incomplete and could negatively affect patient outcomes  In this article, the      authors propose the application of collaborative filtering methods to the      medication reconciliation task  Given a current medication list for a patient,      the authors employ collaborative filtering approaches to predict drugs the      patient could be taking but are missing from their observed list  DESIGN: The      collaborative filtering approach presented in this paper emerges from the insight      that an omission in a medication list is analogous to an item a consumer might      purchase from a product list  Online retailers use collaborative filtering to      recommend relevant products using retrospective purchase data  In this article,      the authors argue that patient information in electronic medical records,      combined with artificial intelligence methods, can enhance medication      reconciliation  The authors formulate the detection of omissions in medication      lists as a collaborative filtering problem  Detection of omissions is      accomplished using several machine-learning approaches  The effectiveness of      these approaches is evaluated using medication data from three long-term care      centers  The authors also propose several decision-theoretic extensions to the      methodology for incorporating medical knowledge into recommendations  RESULTS:      Results show that collaborative filtering identifies the missing drug in the      top-10 list about 40-50% of the time and the therapeutic class of the missing      drug 50%-65% of the time at the three clinics in this study  CONCLUSION: Results       suggest that collaborative filtering can be a valuable tool for reconciling      medication lists, complementing currently recommended process-driven approaches        However, a one-size-fits-all approach is not optimal, and consideration should be      given to context  eg, types of patients and drug regimens  and consequence  eg,      the impact of omission on outcomes

PMID- 21422101   - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the frequencies of pharmaceutical      exposures reported to a poison control center  PCC  and those seen in the      emergency department  ED   DESIGN: A statewide population-based retrospective      comparison of frequencies of ED pharmaceutical poisonings with frequencies of      pharmaceutical exposures reported to a regional PCC  ED poisonings, identified by      International Classification of Diseases, Version 9  ICD-9  codes, were grouped      into substance categories  Using a reproducible algorithm facilitated by      probabilistic linkage, codes from the PCC classification system were mapped into       the same categories  A readily identifiable subset of PCC calls was selected for       comparison  MEASUREMENTS: Correlations between frequencies of quarterly exposures      by substance categories were calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients      and partial correlation coefficients with adjustment for seasonality  RESULTS:      PCC reported exposures correlated with ED poisonings in nine of 10 categories       Partial correlation coefficients  r p   indicated strong associations  r p >0 8        for three substance categories that underwent large changes in their incidences       opiates, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxants   Six substance categories were      moderately correlated  r p >0 6   One category, salicylates, showed no      association  Limitations Imperfect overlap between ICD-9 and PCC codes may have      led to miscategorization  Substances without changes in exposure frequency have      inadequate variability to detect association using this method  CONCLUSION: PCC      data are able to effectively identify trends in poisonings seen in EDs and may be      useful as part of a pharmaceutical poisoning surveillance system  The authors      developed an algorithm-driven technique for mapping American Association of      Poison Control Centers codes to ICD-9 codes and identified a useful subset of      poison control exposures for analysis

PMID- 21422100   - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the literature on clinical decision-support systems'       CDSS  impact on healthcare practitioner performance and patient outcomes       DESIGN: Literature search on Medline, Embase, Inspec, Cinahl, Cochrane/Dare and      analysis of high-quality systematic reviews  SRs  on CDSS in hospital settings       Two-stage inclusion procedure:  1  selection of publications on predefined      inclusion criteria;  2  independent methodological assessment of preincluded SRs       by the 11-item measurement tool, AMSTAR  Inclusion of SRs with AMSTAR score 9 or       above  SRs were thereafter rated on level of evidence  Each stage was performed      by two independent reviewers  RESULTS: 17 out of 35 preincluded SRs were of high       methodological quality and further analyzed  Evidence that CDSS significantly      impacted practitioner performance was found in 52 out of 91 unique studies of the      16 SRs examining this effect  57%   Only 25 out of 82 unique studies of the 16      SRs reported evidence that CDSS positively impacted patient outcomes  30%        CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have found any benefits on patient outcomes, though many      of these have been too small in sample size or too short in time to reveal      clinically important effects  There is significant evidence that CDSS can      positively impact healthcare providers' performance with drug ordering and      preventive care reminder systems as most clear examples  These outcomes may be      explained by the fact that these types of CDSS require a minimum of patient data       that are largely available before the advice is  to be  generated: at the time      clinicians make the decisions

PMID- 21415065   - BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support  CDS  is a valuable tool for improving      healthcare quality and lowering costs  However, there is no comprehensive      taxonomy of types of CDS and there has been limited research on the availability       of various CDS tools across current electronic health record  EHR  systems       OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a taxonomy of front-end CDS tools and to      assess support for these tools in major commercial and internally developed EHRs       STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a modified Delphi approach with a panel of 11      decision support experts to develop a taxonomy of 53 front-end CDS tools  Based      on this taxonomy, a survey on CDS tools was sent to a purposive sample of      commercial EHR vendors  n=9  and leading healthcare institutions with internally       developed state-of-the-art EHRs  n=4   RESULTS: Responses were received from all       healthcare institutions and 7 of 9 EHR vendors  response rate: 85%   All 53 types      of CDS tools identified in the taxonomy were found in at least one surveyed EHR     system, but only 8 functions were present in all EHRs  Medication dosing support       and order facilitators were the most commonly available classes of decision      support, while expert systems  eg, diagnostic decision support, ventilator     management suggestions  were the least common  CONCLUSION: We developed and      validated a comprehensive taxonomy of front-end CDS tools  A subsequent survey of      commercial EHR vendors and leading healthcare institutions revealed a small core       set of common CDS tools, but identified significant variability in the remainder       of clinical decision support content

PMID- 21402737   - OBJECTIVE: To determine characteristics and effects of nurse dosing over-rides of      a clinical decision support system  CDSS  for intensive insulin therapy  IIT  in       critical care units  DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patient database records      and ethnographic study of nurses using IIT CDSS  MEASUREMENTS: The authors      determined the frequency, direction-greater than recommended  GTR  and less than       recommended  LTR - and magnitude of over-rides, and then compared recommended and      over-ride doses' blood glucose  BG  variability and insulin resistance, two      measures of IIT CDSS associated with mortality  The authors hypothesized that      rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia would be greater for recommended than      over-ride doses  Finally, the authors observed and interviewed nurse users       RESULTS: 5 1%  9075  of 179,452 IIT CDSS doses were over-rides  83 4% of      over-ride doses were LTR, and 45 5% of these were >/= 50% lower than recommended       In contrast, 78 9% of GTR doses were </= 25% higher than recommended  When      recommended doses were administered, the rate of hypoglycemia was higher than the      rate for GTR  p = 0 257  and LTR  p = 0 033  doses  When recommended doses were      administered, the rate of hyperglycemia was lower than the rate for GTR  p =      0 003  and LTR  p < 0 001  doses  Estimates of patients' insulin requirements      were higher for LTR doses than recommended and GTR doses  Nurses reported      trusting IIT CDSS overall but appeared concerned about recommendations when      administering LTR doses  CONCLUSION: When over-riding IIT CDSS recommendations,      nurses overwhelmingly administered LTR doses, which emphasized prevention of      hypoglycemia but interfered with hyperglycemia control, especially when BG was      >150 mg/dl  Nurses appeared to consider the amount of a recommended insulin dose,      not a patient's trend of insulin resistance, when administering LTR doses      overall  Over-rides affected IIT CDSS protocol performance

PMID- 21385821   - BACKGROUND: Computerized provider order entry  CPOE  systems have been strongly      promoted as a means to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare  METHODS:      This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence of the impact of CPOE on      medical-imaging services and patient outcomes  RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the       inclusion criteria, most of which  10/14  used a pre-/postintervention comparison      design  Eight studies demonstrated benefits, such as decreased test utilization,       associated with decision-support systems promoting adherence to test ordering      guidelines  Three studies evaluating medical-imaging ordering and reporting times      showed statistically significant decreases in turnaround times  CONCLUSIONS: The       findings reveal the potential for CPOE to contribute to significant efficiency      and effectiveness gains in imaging services  The diversity and scope of the      research evidence can be strengthened through increased attention to the      circumstances and mechanisms that contribute to the success  or otherwise  of      CPOE and its contribution to the enhancement of patient care delivery

PMID- 21292707   - OBJECTIVE: The field of Biomedical and Health Informatics  BMHI  continues to      define itself, and there are many educational programs offering 'informatics'      degrees with varied foci  The goal of this study was to develop a scheme for     systematic comparison of programs across the entire BMHI spectrum and to identify      commonalities among informatics curricula  DESIGN: Guided by several published      competency sets, a grounded theory approach was used to develop a      program/curricula categorization scheme based on the descriptions of 636 courses       offered by 73 public health, nursing, health, medical, and bioinformatics      programs in the USA  The scheme was then used to compare the programs in the      aforementioned five informatics disciplines  RESULTS: The authors developed a      Course-Based Informatics Program Categorization  CBIPC  scheme that can be used      both to classify coursework for any BMHI educational program and to compare      programs from the same or related disciplines  The application of CBIPC scheme to      the analysis of public health, nursing, health, medical, and bioinformatics      programs reveals distinct intradisciplinary curricular patterns and a common core      of courses across the entire BMHI education domain  Limitations The study is      based on descriptions of courses from the university's webpages  Thus, it is      limited to sampling courses at one moment in time, and classification for the      coding scheme is based primarily on course titles and course descriptions       CONCLUSION: The CBIPC scheme combines empirical data about educational curricula       from diverse informatics programs and several published competency sets  It also       provides a foundation for discussion of BMHI education as a whole and can help      define subdisciplinary competencies

PMID- 21270132   - There is a persistent view of a significant minority in the medical informatics      community that the randomized controlled trial  RCT  has a limited role to play      in evaluating clinical information systems  A common reason voiced by skeptics is      that these systems are fundamentally different from drug interventions, so the      RCT is irrelevant  There is an urgent need to promote the use of RCTs, given the       shift to evidence-based policy and the need to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of       these systems  The authors suggest returning to first principles and argue that      what is required is clarity about how to match methods to evaluation questions       The authors address common concerns about RCTs, and the extent to which they are       fallacious, and also discuss the challenges of conducting RCTs in informatics and      alternative study designs when randomized trials are infeasible  While neither a       perfect nor universal evaluation method, RCTs form an important part of an      evaluator's toolkit

PMID- 21262924   - Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside  i2b2  is an initiative      funded by the NIH that aims at building an informatics infrastructure to support       biomedical research  The University of Pavia has recently integrated i2b2      infrastructure with a registry of inherited arrhythmogenic diseases  Within this       project, the authors created a novel i2b2 cell, named R Engine Cell, which allows      the communication between i2b2 and the R statistical software  As survival      analyses are routinely performed by cardiology researchers, the authors have      first concentrated on making Kaplan-Meier analyses available within the i2b2 web       interface  To this aim, the authors developed a web-client plug-in to select the       patient set on which to perform the analysis and to display the results in a      graphical, intuitive way  R Engine Cell has been designed to easily support the      integration of other R-based statistical analyses into i2b2

PMID- 21262923   - OBJECTIVE: Studies of the doctor-patient relationship have focused on the      elaboration of power and/or authority using a range of techniques to study the      encounter between doctor and patient  The widespread adoption of computers by      doctors brings a third party into the consultation  While there has been some      research into the way doctors view and manage this new relationship, the behavior     of patients in response to the computer is rarely studied  In this paper, the      authors use Goffman's dramaturgy to explore patients' approaches to the doctor's       computer in the consultation, and its influence on the patient-doctor     relationship  DESIGN: Observational study of Australian general practice  141      consultations from 20 general practitioners were videotaped and analyzed using a       hermeneutic framework  RESULTS: Patients negotiated the relationship between      themselves, the doctor, and the computer demonstrating two themes: dyadic       dealing primarily with the doctor  or triadic  dealing with both computer and      doctor   Patients used three signaling behaviors in relation to the computer on      the doctor's desk  screen watching, screen ignoring, and screen excluding  to      influence the behavior of the doctor  Patients were able to draw the doctor to      the computer, and used the computer to challenge doctor's statements  CONCLUSION:      This study demonstrates that in consultations where doctors use computers, the      computer can legitimately be regarded as part of a triadic relationship  Routine       use of computers in the consultation changes the doctor-patient relationship, and      is altering the distribution of power and authority between doctor and patient

PMID- 21262922   - BACKGROUND: A 2005 report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and      the Centers for Disease Control Surgical Infection Prevention program indicated      that only 41% of prophylactic antibacterials were correctly stopped within 24 h      of the end of surgery  Electronic order sets have shown promise as a means of      integrating guideline information with electronic order entry systems and      facilitating safer, more effective care  OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the      effectiveness of a computer-based antibacterial order set on increasing the      proportion of patients who have antibacterial wound prophylaxis discontinued in      the appropriate time frame  DESIGN: The authors conducted a quasi-experimental      interrupted time-series analysis over an 8-month study period with the      implementation of a computer-based order system designed to prevent excessive      duration of surgical prophylaxis antibacterials  MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome      was the proportion of surgeries with antibacterials discontinued in the      appropriate time frame  Additionally, we evaluated the percent of surgeries after     implementation of the electronic intervention with chart documentation of      infection among surgeries where the prescriber indicated the reason for     antibacterial therapy was treatment  RESULTS: The computer-based order     intervention significantly improved the proportion of surgeries with timely      discontinuation of antibacterials from 38 8% to 55 7%  p < 0 001  in the      intervention hospital, while the control hospital remained at 56-57%  p = 0 006      for the difference between treated and control hospitals   In surgeries after     intervention implementation where a prescriber indicated the reason for     antibacterial therapy was treatment, the prevalence of chart documented infection      was only 14%  CONCLUSIONS: A computer-based electronic order set intervention      increased timely discontinuation of postoperative antibacterials

PMID- 21262919   - OBJECTIVE: Health information exchange  HIE  is the process of electronically      sharing patient-level information between providers  However, where implemented,       reports indicate HIE system usage is low  The aim of this study was to determine       the factors associated with different types of HIE usage  DESIGN: Cross-sectional      analysis of clinical data from emergency room encounters included in an      operational HIE effort linked to system user logs using crossed random-intercept       logistic regression  MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables included factors      indicative of information needs  System usage was measured as none, basic usage,       or a novel pattern of usage  RESULTS: The system was accessed for 2 3% of all      encounters  6142 out of 271,305   Novel usage patterns were more likely for more       complex patients  The odds of HIE usage were lower in the face of time      constraints  In contrast to expectations, system usage was lower when the patient      was unfamiliar to the facility  LIMITATIONS: Because of differences between HIE      efforts and the fact that not all types of HIE usage  ie, public health  could be      included in the analysis, results are limited in terms of generalizablity       CONCLUSIONS: This study of actual HIE system usage identifies patients and      circumstances in which HIE is more likely to be used and factors that are likely       to discourage usage  The paper explores the implications of the findings for     system redesign, information integration across exchange partners, and for     meaningful usage criteria emerging from provisions of the Health Information      Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act

PMID- 21252053   - OBJECTIVE: Little evidence exists on effective interventions to integrate      HIV-care guidelines into practices within developing countries  This study tested      the hypothesis that clinical summaries with computer-generated reminders could      improve clinicians' compliance with CD4 testing guidelines in the      resource-limited setting of sub-Saharan Africa  DESIGN: A prospective comparative      study of two randomly selected outpatient adult HIV clinics in western Kenya       Printed summaries with reminders for overdue CD4 tests were made available to      clinicians in the intervention clinic but not in the control clinic       MEASUREMENTS: Changes in order rates for overdue CD4 tests were compared between       and within the two clinics  RESULTS: The computerized reminder system identified       717 encounters  21%  with overdue CD4 tests  Analysis by study assignment       regardless of summaries being printed or not  revealed that with      computer-generated reminders, CD4 order rates were significantly higher in the      intervention clinic compared to the control clinic  53% vs 38%, OR = 1 80, CI      1 34 to 2 42, p < 0 0001   When comparison was restricted to encounters where      summaries with reminders were printed, order rates in intervention clinic were      even higher  63%   The intervention clinic increased CD4 ordering from 42% before      reminders to 63% with reminders  50% increase, OR = 2 32, CI 1 67 to 3 22, p <      0 0001 , compared to control clinic with only 8% increase from prestudy baseline        CI 0 83 to 1 46, p = 0 51   Limitations Evaluation was conducted at two clinics       in a single institution  CONCLUSIONS: Clinical summaries with computer-generated       reminders significantly improved clinician compliance with CD4 testing guidelines      in the resource-limited setting of sub-Saharan Africa  This technology can have      broad applicability to improve quality of HIV care in these settings

PMID- 21252052   - OBJECTIVE: Clinical decision support  CDS  is a powerful tool for improving      healthcare quality and ensuring patient safety; however, effective implementation      of CDS requires effective clinical and technical governance structures  The      authors sought to determine the range and variety of these governance structures       and identify a set of recommended practices through observational study  DESIGN:       Three site visits were conducted at institutions across the USA to learn about      CDS capabilities and processes from clinical, technical, and organizational      perspectives  Based on the results of these visits, written questionnaires were      sent to the three institutions visited and two additional sites  Together, these       five organizations encompass a variety of academic and community hospitals as      well as small and large ambulatory practices  These organizations use both      commercially available and internally developed clinical information systems       MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of clinical information systems and CDS systems      used at each site as well as governance structures and content management      approaches were identified through extensive field interviews and follow-up      surveys  RESULTS: Six recommended practices were identified in the area of      governance, and four were identified in the area of content management  Key      similarities and differences between the organizations studied were also      highlighted  CONCLUSION: Each of the five sites studied contributed to the      recommended practices presented in this paper for CDS governance  Since these      strategies appear to be useful at a diverse range of institutions, they should be      considered by any future implementers of decision support

PMID- 21252051   - Patients' functional recovery at home following surgery may be evaluated by      monitoring their activities of daily living  Existing tools for assessing these      activities are labor-intensive to administer and rely heavily on recall  This      study describes the use of a wireless ear-worn activity recognition sensor to      monitor postoperative activity levels continuously using a Bayesian activity      classification framework  The device was used to monitor the postoperative      recovery of five patients following abdominal surgery  Activity was classified      into four groups ranging from very low  level 0  to high  level 3   Overall,      patients were found to be undertaking a higher proportion of level 0 activities      on postoperative day 1 which was gradually replaced by higher-level activities      over the next 3 days  This study demonstrates how a pervasive healthcare      technology can objectively monitor functional recovery in the unsupervised home      setting  This may be a useful adjunct to existing postoperative monitoring      systems

PMID- 21233086   - Clinical documentation is central to patient care  The success of electronic      health record system adoption may depend on how well such systems support      clinical documentation  A major goal of integrating clinical documentation into      electronic heath record systems is to generate reusable data  As a result, there       has been an emphasis on deploying computer-based documentation systems that      prioritize direct structured documentation  Research has demonstrated that      healthcare providers value different factors when writing clinical notes, such as      narrative expressivity, amenability to the existing workflow, and usability  The       authors explore the tension between expressivity and structured clinical      documentation, review methods for obtaining reusable data from clinical notes,      and recommend that healthcare providers be able to choose how to document patient      care based on workflow and note content needs  When reusable data are needed from      notes, providers can use structured documentation or rely on post-hoc text      processing to produce structured data, as appropriate

PMID- 21169620   - Federal legislation  Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical      Health  HITECH  Act  has provided funds to support an unprecedented increase in      health information technology  HIT  adoption for healthcare provider     organizations and professionals throughout the U S  While recognizing the promise      that widespread HIT adoption and meaningful use can bring to efforts to improve      the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare, the American Medical      Informatics Association devoted its 2009 Annual Health Policy Meeting to      consideration of unanticipated consequences that could result with the increased       implementation of HIT  Conference participants focused on possible unintended and      unanticipated, as well as undesirable, consequences of HIT implementation  They      employed an input-output model to guide discussion on occurrence of these      consequences in four domains: technical, human/cognitive, organizational, and      fiscal/policy and regulation  The authors outline the conference's      recommendations:  1  an enhanced research agenda to guide study into the causes,       manifestations, and mitigation of unintended consequences resulting from HIT      implementations;  2  creation of a framework to promote sharing of HIT      implementation experiences and the development of best practices that minimize      unintended consequences; and  3  recognition of the key role of the Federal      Government in providing leadership and oversight in analyzing the effects of      HIT-related implementations and policies

PMID- 21169619   - OBJECTIVE: Informatics applications have the potential to improve participation      in clinical trials, but their design must be based on user-centered research       This research used a fully counterbalanced experimental design to investigate the      effect of changes made to the original version of a website,      http://BreastCancerTrials org/, and confirm that the revised version addressed      and reinforced patients' needs and expectations  DESIGN: Participants included      women who had received a breast cancer diagnosis within the last 5 years  N=77         They were randomized into two groups: one group used and reviewed the original      version first followed by the redesigned version, and the other group used and      reviewed them in reverse order  MEASUREMENTS: The study used both quantitative      and qualitative measures  During use, participants' click paths and general      reactions were observed  After use, participants were asked to answer survey      items and open-ended questions to indicate their reactions and which version they      preferred and met their needs and expectations better  RESULTS: Overall, the      revised version of the site was preferred and perceived to be clearer, easier to       navigate, more trustworthy and credible, and more private and safe overall       However, users who viewed the original version last had similar attitudes toward       both versions  CONCLUSION: By applying research findings to the redesign of a      website for clinical trial searching, it was possible to re-engineer the      interface to better support patients' decisions to participate in clinical      trials  The mechanisms of action in this case appeared to revolve around creating      an environment that supported a sense of personal control and decisional      autonomy

PMID- 21169618   - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare organizations must de-identify patient records before      sharing data  Many organizations rely on the Safe Harbor Standard of the HIPAA      Privacy Rule, which enumerates 18 identifiers that must be suppressed  eg, ages      over 89   An alternative model in the Privacy Rule, known as the Statistical      Standard, can facilitate the sharing of more detailed data, but is rarely applied      because of a lack of published methodologies  The authors propose an intuitive      approach to de-identifying patient demographics in accordance with the      Statistical Standard  DESIGN: The authors conduct an analysis of the demographics      of patient cohorts in five medical centers developed for the NIH-sponsored      Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network, with respect to the US census       They report the re-identification risk of patient demographics disclosed      according to the Safe Harbor policy and the relative risk rate for sharing such      information via alternative policies  MEASUREMENTS: The re-identification risk of      Safe Harbor demographics ranged from 0 01% to 0 19%  The findings show      alternative de-identification models can be created with risks no greater than      Safe Harbor  The authors illustrate that the disclosure of patient ages over the       age of 89 is possible when other features are reduced in granularity       LIMITATIONS: The de-identification approach described in this paper was evaluated      with demographic data only and should be evaluated with other potential      identifiers  CONCLUSION: Alternative de-identification policies to the Safe      Harbor model can be derived for patient demographics to enable the disclosure of       values that were previously suppressed  The method is generalizable to any      environment in which population statistics are available

PMID- 21134976   - Over the last four decades, the UK has made large investments in healthcare      information technology  The authors conducted interviews and reviewed published      and unpublished documents to describe national-scale clinical information      exchange in England, how it was achieved, and the problems experienced that the      USA might avoid  Clinical information exchange in the UK was accomplished by      establishing a foundation of policy, infrastructure, and systems of care, by      creating and acquiring clinical computing applications and with strong use of      financial and clinical incentives  Many software and hardware vendors played a      part in this effort; they participated in a national framework created by the NHS      in which standards for exchange are specified and their applications designed to       make clinical information exchange part of normal practice  Great potential      exists for cost reduction, increased safety, and greater patient involvement as a      result of clinical information exchange

PMID- 21134975   - OBJECTIVES: To characterize patterns of electronic medical record  EMR  use at      pediatric primary care acute visits  DESIGN: Direct observational study of 529      acute visits with 27 experienced pediatric clinician users  MEASUREMENTS: For     each 20 s interval and at each stage of the visit according to the Davis      Observation Code, we recorded whether the physician was communicating with the      family only, using the computer while communicating, or using the computer     without communication  Regression models assessed the impact of clinician,      patient and visit characteristics on overall visit length, time spent interacting      with families, and time spent using the computer while interacting  RESULTS: The       mean overall visit length was 11:30  min:sec  with 9:06 spent in the exam room       Clinicians used the EMR during 27% of exam room time and at all stages of the      visit  interacting, chatting, and building rapport; history taking; formulation      of the diagnosis and treatment plan; and discussing prevention  except the      physical exam  Communication with the family accompanied 70% of EMR use  In      regression models, computer documentation outside the exam room was associated      with visits that were 11% longer  p=0 001 , and female clinicians spent more time      using the computer while communicating  p=0 003   LIMITATIONS: The 12 study      practices shared one EMR  CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric clinicians with EMR     experience, conversation accompanies most EMR use  Our results suggest that      efforts to improve EMR usability and clinician EMR training should focus on use      in the context of doctor-patient communication  Further study of the impact of      documentation inside versus outside the exam room on productivity is warranted

PMID- 21131607   - OBJECTIVE: Pharmacy clinical decision-support  CDS  software that contains      drug-drug interaction  DDI  information may augment pharmacists' ability to      detect clinically significant interactions  However, studies indicate these      systems may miss some important interactions  The purpose of this study was to      assess the performance of pharmacy CDS programs to detect clinically important      DDIs  DESIGN: Researchers made on-site visits to 64 participating Arizona      pharmacies between December 2008 and November 2009 to analyze the ability of      pharmacy information systems and associated CDS to detect DDIs  Software      evaluation was conducted to determine whether DDI alerts arose from prescription       orders entered into the pharmacy computer systems for a standardized fictitious      patient  The fictitious patient's orders consisted of 18 different medications      including 19 drug pairs-13 of which were clinically significant DDIs, and six      were non-interacting drug pairs  MEASUREMENTS: The sensitivity, specificity,      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and percentage of correct      responses were measured for each of the pharmacy CDS systems  RESULTS: Only 18       28%  of the 64 pharmacies correctly identified eligible interactions and      non-interactions  The median percentage of correct DDI responses was 89%  range      47-100%  for participating pharmacies  The median sensitivity to detect      well-established interactions was 0 85  range 0 23-1 0 ; median specificity was      1 0  range 0 83-1 0 ; median positive predictive value was 1 0  range 0 88-1 0 ;       and median negative predictive value was 0 75  range 0 38-1 0   CONCLUSIONS:      These study results indicate that many pharmacy clinical decision-support systems      perform less than optimally with respect to identifying well-known, clinically      relevant interactions  Comprehensive system improvements regarding the manner in       which pharmacy information systems identify potential DDIs are warranted

PMID- 21131606   - Abbreviation use is a preventable cause of medication errors  The objective of      this study was to test whether computerized alerts designed to reduce medication       abbreviations and embedded within an electronic progress note program could      reduce these abbreviations in the non-computer-assisted handwritten notes of      physicians  Fifty-nine physicians were randomized to one of three groups: a      forced correction alert group; an auto-correction alert group; or a group that      received no alerts  Over time, physicians in all groups significantly reduced      their use of these abbreviations in their handwritten notes  Physicians exposed      to the forced correction alert showed the greatest reductions in use when      compared to controls  p=0 02  and the auto-correction alert group  p=0 0005        Knowledge of unapproved abbreviations was measured before and after the      intervention and did not improve  p=0 81   This work demonstrates the effects      that alert systems can have on physician behavior in a non-computerized      environment and in the absence of knowledge

PMID- 21113077   - The authors developed a computer-based medical history for patients to take in      their homes via the internet  The history consists of 232 'primary' questions      asked of all patients, together with more than 6000 questions, explanations, and       suggestions that are available for presentation as determined by a patient's      responses  The purpose of this research was to measure the test-retest      reliability of the 215 primary questions that have preformatted, mutually      exclusive responses of 'Yes,' 'No,' 'Uncertain  Don't know, Maybe ,' 'Don't      understand,' and 'I'd rather not answer ' From randomly selected patients of      doctors affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, 48      patients took the history twice with intervals between sessions ranging from 1 to      35&emsp14;days  mean 7&emsp14;days; median 5&emsp14;days   High levels of      test-retest reliability were found for most of the questions, but as a result of       this study the authors revised five questions  They recommend that structured      medical history questions that will be asked of many patients be measured for     test-retest reliability before they are put into widespread clinical practice

PMID- 21113074   - This case report describes a qualitative investigation into how a Hands-free      Communication Device  HCD  system impacted communication among anesthesia staff      in a pediatric surgical suite  The authors recruited a purposive sample that      included anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, circulating       nurses, a charge nurse, and a postanesthesia care unit nurse  Data were collected      using semistructured interviews and observations, then analyzed using a constant       comparison approach  The results corroborate and enrich themes that were      discovered in a previous qualitative study of HCD systems:  1  communication      access,  2  control,  3  training,  4  environment and infrastructure  The      results also generated new subthemes and themes:  1  technical control,  2       choosing communication channels, and  3  reliability  The authors conclude that      HCD systems profoundly impacted communication in a largely positive way, although      reliability of the technology remained an issue  The authors' findings contribute      a valuable insight into the growing body of knowledge about implementation and      use of HCD systems

PMID- 21106995   - 'Semantic Interoperability' is a driving objective behind many of Health Level      Seven's standards  The objective in this paper is to take a step back, and      consider what semantic interoperability means, assess whether or not it has been       achieved, and, if not, determine what concrete next steps can be taken to get      closer  A framework for measuring semantic interoperability is proposed, using a       technique called the 'Single Logical Information Model' framework, which relies      on an operational definition of semantic interoperability and an understanding      that interoperability improves incrementally  Whether semantic interoperability      tomorrow will enable one computer to talk to another, much as one person can talk      to another person, is a matter for speculation  It is assumed, however, that what      gets measured gets improved, and in that spirit this framework is offered as a      means to improvement

PMID- 21106993   - This case report describes how two complementary standards, CONTsys  European      Standard EN 13940-1 for continuity of care  and the reference model of openEHR,      were applied in modeling a shared care plan for shared homecare based on      requirements from the OLD@HOME project  Our study shows that these requirements      are matched by CONTsys on a general level  However, certain attributes are not      explicit in CONTsys, for example agents responsible for performing planned      interventions, and support for monitoring outcome of interventions  We further     studied how the care plan conceptual model can be implemented using the openEHR     reference model  The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing shared care      plans combining a standard concept model, for example CONTsys with an electronic       health records  EHR  interoperability specification, that is the openEHR, while      highlighting areas that need further exploration  It also explores the      reusability of existing clinical archetypes as building blocks of care plans and       the modeling of new shared care plan archetypes

PMID- 21075789   - The current commercial health information technology  HIT  arena encompasses a      number of competing firms that provide electronic health applications to      hospitals, clinical practices, and other healthcare-related entities  Such      applications collect, store, and analyze patient information  Some vendors      incorporate contract language whereby purchasers of HIT systems, such as      hospitals and clinics, must indemnify vendors for malpractice or personal injury       claims, even if those events are not caused or fostered by the purchasers  Some      vendors require contract clauses that force HIT system purchasers to adopt      vendor-defined policies that prevent the disclosure of errors, bugs, design      flaws, and other HIT-software-related hazards  To address this issue, the AMIA      Board of Directors appointed a Task Force to provide an analysis and insights       Task Force findings and recommendations include: patient safety should trump all       other values; corporate concerns about liability and intellectual property      ownership may be valid but should not over-ride all other considerations;      transparency and a commitment to patient safety should govern vendor contracts;      institutions are duty-bound to provide ethics education to purchasers and users,       and should commit publicly to standards of corporate conduct; and vendors, system      purchasers, and users should encourage and assist in each others' efforts to      adopt best practices  Finally, the HIT community should re-examine whether and      how regulation of electronic health applications could foster improved care,      public health, and patient safety

PMID- 20962137   - Currently, adverse drug reaction  ADR  causality and severity are assessed using       different systems but there is no standard method to combine the results  In this      work, a combined ADR causality and severity assessment system, including an      online version, was developed  Logical rules were defined to translate the score       obtained from the system into three alert zones: green, amber, and red  The alert      zones are useful for triaging ADR cases as they help define the seriousness of      the ADR and the urgency of the responses required  This new scoring system may be      useful for clinicians, investigators, and regulators seeking information on the      likelihood of a drug causing an adverse reaction, and whether an adverse reaction      is sufficiently dangerous for the drug to be withheld or undergo further     investigation

PMID- 20962135   - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Readiness for Implementation Model  RIM         This model predicts a healthcare organization's potential for success in      implementing an interactive health communication system  IHCS   The model      consists of seven weighted factors, with each factor containing five to seven      elements  DESIGN: Two decision-analytic approaches, self-explicated and conjoint       analysis, were used to measure the weights of the RIM with a sample of 410      experts  The RIM model with weights was then validated in a prospective study of       25 IHCS implementation cases  MEASUREMENTS: Orthogonal main effects design was      used to develop 700 conjoint-analysis profiles, which varied on seven factors       Each of the 410 experts rated the importance and desirability of the factors and       their levels, as well as a set of 10 different profiles  For the prospective      25-case validation, three time-repeated measures of the RIM scores were collected      for comparison with the implementation outcomes  RESULTS: Two of the seven      factors, 'organizational motivation' and 'meeting user needs,' were found to be      most important in predicting implementation readiness  No statistically      significant difference was found in the predictive validity of the two approaches       self-explicated and conjoint analysis   The RIM was a better predictor for the      1-year implementation outcome than the half-year outcome  LIMITATIONS: The expert      sample, the order of the survey tasks, the additive model, and basing the RIM      cut-off score on experience are possible limitations of the study  CONCLUSION:      The RIM needs to be empirically evaluated in institutions adopting IHCS and      sustaining the system in the long term

PMID- 20962134   - Physician-patient email communication is gaining popularity  However, a formal      assessment of physicians' email communication skills has not been described  We      hypothesized that the email communication skills of rheumatology fellows can be      measured in an objective structured clinical examination  OSCE  setting using a      novel email content analysis instrument which has 18 items  During an OSCE, we      asked 50 rheumatology fellows to respond to a simulated patient email  The      content of the responses was assessed using our instrument  The majority of      rheumatology fellows wrote appropriate responses scoring a mean  +/-SD  of 10 6       +/-2 6  points  maximum score 18 , with high inter-rater reliability  0 86        Most fellows were concise  74%  and courteous  68%  but not formal  22%        Ninety-two percent of fellows acknowledged that the patient's condition required       urgent medical attention, but only 30% took active measures to contact the      patient  No one encrypted their messages  The objective assessment of email      communication skills is possible using simulated emails in an OSCE setting  The      variable email communication scores and incidental patient safety gaps      identified, suggest a need for further training and defined proficiency standards      for physicians' email communication skills

PMID- 20962133   - OBJECTIVE: Negation is a linguistic phenomenon that marks the absence of an      entity or event  Negated events are frequently reported in both biological      literature and clinical notes  Text mining applications benefit from the      detection of negation and its scope  However, due to the complexity of language,       identifying the scope of negation in a sentence is not a trivial task  DESIGN:      Conditional random fields  CRF , a supervised machine-learning algorithm, were      used to train models to detect negation cue phrases and their scope in both      biological literature and clinical notes  The models were trained on the publicly      available BioScope corpus  MEASUREMENT: The performance of the CRF models was      evaluated on identifying the negation cue phrases and their scope by calculating       recall, precision and F1-score  The models were compared with four competitive      baseline systems  RESULTS: The best CRF-based model performed statistically      better than all baseline systems and NegEx, achieving an F1-score of 98% and 95%       on detecting negation cue phrases and their scope in clinical notes, and an      F1-score of 97% and 85% on detecting negation cue phrases and their scope in      biological literature  CONCLUSIONS: This approach is robust, as it can identify      negation scope in both biological and clinical text  To benefit text mining      applications, the system is publicly available as a Java API and as an online      application at http://negscope askhermes org

PMID- 20962132   - OBJECTIVE: To propose a centralized method for generating global unique      identifiers to link collections of research data and specimens  DESIGN: The work       is a collaboration between the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative and      the National Database for Autism Research  The system is implemented as a web      service: an investigator inputs identifying information about a participant into       a client application and sends encrypted information to a server application,      which returns a generated global unique identifier  The authors evaluated the      system using a volume test of one million simulated individuals and a field test       on 2000 families  over 8000 individual participants  in an autism study       MEASUREMENTS: Inverse probability of hash codes; rate of false identity of two      individuals; rate of false split of single individual; percentage of subjects for     which identifying information could be collected; percentage of hash codes      generated successfully  RESULTS: Large-volume simulation generated no false      splits or false identity  Field testing in the Simons Foundation Autism Research       Initiative Simplex Collection produced identifiers for 96% of children in the      study and 77% of parents  On average, four out of five hash codes per subject      were generated perfectly  only one perfect hash is required for subsequent      matching   DISCUSSION: The system must achieve balance among the competing goals       of distinguishing individuals, collecting accurate information for matching, and       protecting confidentiality  Considerable effort is required to obtain approval      from institutional review boards, obtain consent from participants, and to      achieve compliance from sites during a multicenter study  CONCLUSION: Generic      unique identifiers have the potential to link collections of research data,      augment the amount and types of data available for individuals, support detection      of overlap between collections, and facilitate replication of research findings

PMID- 20962130   - OBJECTIVE: To study existing problem list terminologies  PLTs , and to identify a      subset of concepts based on standard terminologies that occur frequently in      problem list data  DESIGN: Problem list terms and their usage frequencies were      collected from large healthcare institutions  MEASUREMENT: The pattern of usage      of the terms was analyzed  The local terms were mapped to the Unified Medical      Language System  UMLS   Based on the mapped UMLS concepts, the degree of overlap       between the PLTs was analyzed  RESULTS: Six institutions submitted 76,237 terms      and their usage frequencies in 14 million patients  The distribution of usage was      highly skewed  On average, 21% of unique terms already covered 95% of usage  The       most frequently used 14,395 terms, representing the union of terms that covered      95% of usage in each institution, were exhaustively mapped to the UMLS  13,261      terms were successfully mapped to 6776 UMLS concepts  Less frequently used terms       were generally less 'mappable' to the UMLS  The mean pairwise overlap of the PLTs      was only 21%  median 19%   Concepts that were shared among institutions were used      eight times more often than concepts unique to one institution  A SNOMED Problem       List Subset of frequently used problem list concepts was identified  CONCLUSIONS:      Most of the frequently used problem list terms could be found in standard      terminologies  The overlap between existing PLTs was low  The use of the SNOMED      Problem List Subset will save developmental effort, reduce variability of PLTs,      and enhance interoperability of problem list data

PMID- 20962129   - The author discusses the challenges of pharmacovigilance using electronic medical      record and claims data  Use of ICD-9 encoded data has low sensitivity for     detection of adverse drug events  ADEs , because it requires that an ADE escalate      to major-complaint level before it can be identified, and because clinical      symptomatology is relatively under-represented in ICD-9  A more appropriate      vocabulary for ADE identification, SNOMED CT, awaits wider deployment  The      narrative-text record of progress notes can potentially be used for more      sensitive ADE detection  More effective surveillance will require the ability to       grade ADEs by severity  Finally, access to online drug information that includes       both a reliable hierarchy of drug families as well as structured information on      existing ADEs can improve the focus and predictive ability of surveillance      efforts

PMID- 20962125   - The purpose of this review is to consolidate existing evidence from published      systematic reviews on health information system  HIS  evaluation studies to      inform HIS practice and research  Fifty reviews published during 1994-2008 were      selected for meta-level synthesis  These reviews covered five areas: medication      management, preventive care, health conditions, data quality, and care      process/outcome  After reconciliation for duplicates, 1276 HIS studies were      arrived at as the non-overlapping corpus  On the basis of a subset of 287      controlled HIS studies, there is some evidence for improved quality of care, but       in varying degrees across topic areas  For instance, 31/43  72%  controlled HIS      studies had positive results using preventive care reminders, mostly through      guideline adherence such as immunization and health screening  Key factors that      influence HIS success included having in-house systems, developers as users,      integrated decision support and benchmark practices, and addressing such      contextual issues as provider knowledge and perception, incentives, and      legislation/policy

PMID- 20962124   - Medication errors are a major source of morbidity and mortality  Inadequate      laboratory monitoring of high-risk medications after initial prescription is a      medical error that contributes to preventable adverse drug events  Health      information technology  HIT -based clinical decision support may improve patient       safety by improving the laboratory monitoring of high-risk medications, but the      effectiveness of such interventions is unclear  Therefore, the authors conducted       a systematic review to identify studies that evaluate the independent effect of      HIT interventions on improving laboratory monitoring for high-risk medications in      the ambulatory setting using a Medline search from January 1, 1980 through      January 1, 2009 and a manual review of relevant bibliographies  All      anticoagulation monitoring studies were excluded  Eight articles met the      inclusion criteria, including six randomized controlled trials and two pre-post      intervention studies  Six of the studies were conducted in two large, integrated       healthcare delivery systems in the USA  Overall, five of the eight studies      reported statistically significant, but small, improvements in laboratory      monitoring; only half of the randomized controlled trials reported statistically       significant improvements  Studies that found no improvement were more likely to      have used analytic strategies that addressed clustering and confounding  Whether       HIT improves laboratory monitoring of certain high-risk medications for     ambulatory patients remains unclear, and further research is needed to clarify      this important question

PMID- 20962123   - Following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Israel Defense Force Medical       Corps dispatched a field hospital unit  A specially tailored information      technology solution was deployed within the hospital  The solution included a      hospital administration system as well as a complete electronic medical record  A      light-weight picture archiving and communication system was also deployed  During      10 days of operation, the system registered 1111 patients  The network and system      up times were more than 99 9%  Patient movements within the hospital were noted,       and an online command dashboard screen was generated  Patient care was delivered       using the electronic medical record  Digital radiographs were acquired and      transmitted to stations throughout the hospital  The system helped to introduce      order in an otherwise chaotic situation and enabled adequate utilization of      scarce medical resources by continually gathering information, analyzing it, and       presenting it to the decision-making command level  The establishment of      electronic medical records promoted the adequacy of medical treatment and      facilitated continuity of care  This experience in Haiti supports the feasibility      of deploying information technologies within a field hospital operation  Disaster     response teams and agencies are encouraged to consider the use of information      technology as part of their contingency plans

PMID- 20962121   - Current research suggests that the rate of adoption of health information      technology  HIT  is low, and that HIT may not have the touted beneficial effects       on quality of care or costs  The twin issues of the failure of HIT adoption and      of HIT efficacy stem primarily from a series of fallacies about HIT  We discuss      12 HIT fallacies and their implications for design and implementation  These      fallacies must be understood and addressed for HIT to yield better results       Foundational cognitive and human factors engineering research and development are      essential to better inform HIT development, deployment, and use

PMID- 20962120   - Advances in clinical and translational science, along with related national-scale      policy and funding mechanisms, have provided significant opportunities for the      advancement of applied clinical research informatics  CRI  and translational      bioinformatics  TBI   Such efforts are primarily oriented to application and      infrastructure development and are critical to the conduct of clinical and      translational research  However, they often come at the expense of the      foundational CRI and TBI research needed to grow these important biomedical      informatics subdisciplines and ensure future innovations  In light of this      challenge, it is critical that a number of steps be taken, including the conduct       of targeted advocacy campaigns, the development of community-accepted research      agendas, and the continued creation of forums for collaboration and knowledge      exchange  Such efforts are needed to ensure that the biomedical informatics      community is able to advance CRI and TBI science in the context of the modern      clinical and translational science era

PMID- 20819872   - To determine the quality and completeness of the list of home medications      documented by nurses using a codified process, authors conducted a comparative      study of home medications using a non-codified and codified process for     documentation of required data fields including drug, dose, route of      administration, frequency, and schedule  Each documented home medication  DHM       was evaluated based on the ability to convert to an inpatient medication order       The home medication was classified as non-convertible if one or more of the      required data fields were missing, inaccurate, or incomplete  The study compared       176 patients with 1618 DHM in the non-codified group to 94 patients with 646 DHM       in the codified group  All DHM could be converted to inpatient orders for 70% of       the patients in the codified group compared with 42% in the non-codified group       Based on each DHM, the codified process resulted in 92% of the DHM being able to       convert to inpatient orders compared with 82% for the non-codified process       Authors conclude that use of a codified process to document home medications has       the potential to increase the number of complete drug entries and in the number     of patients with a DHM list in which all of the medication entries have all of      the dosing information

PMID- 20819871   - OBJECTIVE: To identify challenges in mapping internal International      Classification of Disease, 9th edition, Clinical Modification  ICD-9-CM  encoded       legacy data to Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine  SNOMED , using      SNOMED-prescribed compositional approaches where appropriate, and to explore the       mapping coverage provided by the US National Library of Medicine  NLM 's SNOMED      clinical core subset  DESIGN: This study selected ICD-CM codes that occurred at      least 100 times in the organization's problem list or diagnosis data in 2008       After eliminating codes whose exact mappings were already available in UMLS, the       remainder were mapped manually with software assistance  RESULTS: Of the 2194      codes, 784  35 7%  required manual mapping  435 of these represented concept      types documented in SNOMED as deprecated: these included the qualifying phrases      such as 'not elsewhere classified'  A third of the codes were composite,      requiring multiple SNOMED code to map  Representing 45 composite concepts      required introducing disjunction  'or'  or set-difference  'without'  operators,       which are not currently defined in SNOMED  Only 47% of the concepts required for       composition were present in the clinical core subset  Search of SNOMED for the      correct concepts often required extensive application of knowledge of both      English and medical synonymy  CONCLUSION: Strategies to deal with legacy ICD data      must address the issue of codes created by non-taxonomist users  The NLM core      subset possibly needs augmentation with concepts from certain SNOMED hierarchies,      notably qualifiers, body structures, substances/products and organisms       Concept-matching software needs to utilize query expansion strategies, but these       may be effective in production settings only if a large but non-redundant SNOMED       subset that minimizes the proportion of extensively pre-coordinated concepts is      also available

PMID- 20819870   - OBJECTIVE: Standardized surveillance syndromes do not exist but would facilitate       sharing data among surveillance systems and comparing the accuracy of existing      systems  The objective of this study was to create reference syndrome definitions      from a consensus of investigators who currently have or are building syndromic      surveillance systems  DESIGN: Clinical condition-syndrome pairs were catalogued      for 10 surveillance systems across the United States and the representatives of      these systems were brought together for a workshop to discuss consensus syndrome       definitions  RESULTS: Consensus syndrome definitions were generated for the four       syndromes monitored by the majority of the 10 participating surveillance systems:      Respiratory, gastrointestinal, constitutional, and influenza-like illness  ILI         An important element in coming to consensus quickly was the development of a      sensitive and specific definition for respiratory and gastrointestinal syndromes       After the workshop, the definitions were refined and supplemented with keywords      and regular expressions, the keywords were mapped to standard vocabularies, and a      web ontology language  OWL  ontology was created  LIMITATIONS: The consensus      definitions have not yet been validated through implementation  CONCLUSION: The      consensus definitions provide an explicit description of the current      state-of-the-art syndromes used in automated surveillance, which can subsequently      be systematically evaluated against real data to improve the definitions  The      method for creating consensus definitions could be applied to other domains that       have diverse existing definitions

PMID- 20819869   - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain if outpatients with moderate chronic kidney disease  CKD       had their condition documented in their notes in the electronic health record       EHR   DESIGN: Outpatients with CKD were selected based on a reduced estimated      glomerular filtration rate and their notes extracted from the Columbia University      data warehouse  Two lexical-based classification tools  classifier and      word-counter  were developed to identify documentation of CKD in electronic      notes  MEASUREMENTS: The tools categorized patients' individual notes on the      basis of the presence of CKD-related terms  Patients were categorized as      appropriately documented if their notes contained reference to CKD when CKD was      present  RESULTS: The sensitivities of the classifier and word-count methods were      95 4% and 99 8%, respectively  The specificity of both was 99 8%  Categorization       of individual patients as appropriately documented was 96 9% accurate  Of 107      patients with manually verified moderate CKD, 32  22%  lacked appropriate      documentation  Patients whose CKD had not been appropriately documented were      significantly less likely to be on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or have      urine protein quantified, and had the illness for half as long  15 1 vs 30 7      months; p<0 01  compared to patients with documentation  CONCLUSION: Our studies       show that lexical-based classification tools can accurately ascertain if      appropriate documentation of CKD is present in a EHR  Using this method, we      demonstrated under-documentation of patients with moderate CKD  Under-documented       patients were less likely to receive CKD guideline recommended care  A tool that       prompts providers to document CKD might shorten the time to implementing      guideline-based recommendations

PMID- 20819867   - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of interruptions and task complexity on error     rates when prescribing with computerized provider order entry  CPOE  systems, and      to categorize the types of prescribing errors  DESIGN: Two within-subject      factors: task complexity  complex vs simple  and interruption  interruption vs no      interruption   Thirty-two hospital doctors used a CPOE system in a computer     laboratory to complete four prescribing tasks, half of which were interrupted      using a counterbalanced design  MEASUREMENTS: Types of prescribing errors, error       rate, resumption lag, and task completion time  RESULTS: Errors in creating and      updating electronic medication charts that were measured included failure to      enter allergy information; selection of incorrect medication, dose, route,      formulation, or frequency of administration from lists and drop-down menus      presented by the CPOE system; incorrect entry or omission in entering      administration times, start date, and free-text qualifiers; and omissions in      prescribing and ceasing medications  When errors occurred, the error rates across      the four prescribing tasks ranged from 0 5%  1 incorrect medication selected out       of 192 chances for selecting a medication or error opportunities  to 16%  5      failures to enter allergy information out of 32 error opportunities   Any impact       of interruptions on prescribing error rates and task completion times was not      detected in our experiment  However, complex tasks took significantly longer to      complete  F 1, 27 =137 9; p<0 001  and when execution was interrupted they      required almost three times longer to resume compared to simple tasks  resumption      lag complex=9 6 seconds, SD=5 6; resumption lag simple=3 4 seconds, SD=1 7;      t 28 =6 186; p<0 001   CONCLUSION: Most electronic prescribing errors found in      this study could be described as slips in using the CPOE system to create and      update electronic medication charts  Cues available within the user interface may      have aided resumption of interrupted tasks making CPOE systems robust to some      interruption effects  Further experiments are required to rule out any effect      interruption might have on CPOE error rates

PMID- 20819863   - OBJECTIVE: While essential for patient care, information related to medication is      often written as free text in clinical records and, therefore, difficult to use      in computerized systems  This paper describes an approach to automatically      extract medication information from clinical records, which was developed to      participate in the i2b2 2009 challenge, as well as different strategies to      improve the extraction  DESIGN: Our approach relies on a semantic lexicon and      extraction rules as a two-phase strategy: first, drug names are recognized and,      then, the context of these names is explored to extract drug-related information        mode, dosage, etc  according to rules capturing the document structure and the      syntax of each kind of information  Different configurations are tested to      improve this baseline system along several dimensions, particularly drug name      recognition-this step being a determining factor to extract drug-related      information  Changes were tested at the level of the lexicons and of the      extraction rules  RESULTS: The initial system participating in i2b2 achieved good      results  global F-measure of 77%   Further testing of different configurations      substantially improved the system  global F-measure of 81% , performing well for       all types of information  eg, 84% for drug names and 88% for modes , except for     durations and reasons, which remain problematic  CONCLUSION: This study      demonstrates that a simple rule-based system can achieve good performance on the       medication extraction task  We also showed that controlled modifications  lexicon      filtering and rule refinement  were the improvements that best raised the      performance

PMID- 20819861   - OBJECTIVE: This article describes a system developed for the 2009 i2b2 Medication      Extraction Challenge  The purpose of this challenge is to extract medication      information from hospital discharge summaries  DESIGN: The system explored      several linguistic natural language processing techniques  eg, term-based and      token-based rule matching  to identify medication-related information in the      narrative text  A number of lexical resources was constructed to profile lexical       or morphological features for different categories of medication constituents       MEASUREMENTS: Performance was evaluated in terms of the micro-averaged F-measure       at the horizontal system level  RESULTS: The automated system performed well, and      achieved an F-micro of 80% for the term-level results and 81% for the token-level      results, placing it sixth in exact matches and fourth in inexact matches in the      i2b2 competition  CONCLUSION: The overall results show that this relatively      simple rule-based approach is capable of tackling multiple entity identification       tasks such as medication extraction under situations in which few training      documents are annotated for machine learning approaches, and the entity      information can be characterized with a set of feature tokens

PMID- 20819860   - OBJECTIVE: In the i2b2 Medication Extraction Challenge, medication names together     with details of their administration were to be extracted from medical discharge       summaries  DESIGN: The task of the challenge was decomposed into three pipelined       components: named entity identification, context-aware filtering and relation      extraction  For named entity identification, first a rule-based  RB  method that       was used in our overall fifth place-ranked solution at the challenge was      investigated  Second, a conditional random fields  CRF  approach is presented for     named entity identification  NEI  developed after the completion of the      challenge  The CRF models are trained on the 17 ground truth documents, the      output of the rule-based NEI component on all documents, a larger but potentially      inaccurate training dataset  For both NEI approaches their effect on relation      extraction performance was investigated  The filtering and relation extraction      components are both rule-based  MEASUREMENTS: In addition to the official entry      level evaluation of the challenge, entity level analysis is also provided       RESULTS: On the test data an entry level F 1 -score of 80% was achieved for exact      matching and 81% for inexact matching with the RB-NEI component  The CRF produces      a significantly weaker result, but CRF outperforms the rule-based model with 81%       exact and 82% inexact F 1 -score  p<0 02   CONCLUSION: This study shows that a      simple rule-based method is on a par with more complicated machine learners; CRF       models can benefit from the addition of the potentially inaccurate training data,      when only very few training documents are available  Such training data could be       generated using the outputs of rule-based methods

PMID- 20819856   - OBJECTIVE: Medication information comprises a most valuable source of data in      clinical records  This paper describes use of a cascade of machine learners that       automatically extract medication information from clinical records  DESIGN:      Authors developed a novel supervised learning model that incorporates two machine      learning algorithms and several rule-based engines  MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation of      each step included precision, recall and F-measure metrics  The final outputs of       the system were scored using the i2b2 workshop evaluation metrics, including      strict and relaxed matching with a gold standard  RESULTS: Evaluation results      showed greater than 90% accuracy on five out of seven entities in the name entity      recognition task, and an F-measure greater than 95% on the relationship      classification task  The strict micro averaged F-measure for the system output      achieved best submitted performance of the competition, at 85 65%  LIMITATIONS:      Clinical staff will only use practical processing systems if they have confidence      in their reliability  Authors estimate that an acceptable accuracy for a such a      working system should be approximately 95%  This leaves a significant performance      gap of 5 to 10% from the current processing capabilities  CONCLUSION: A      multistage method with mixed computational strategies using a combination of      rule-based classifiers and statistical classifiers seems to provide a      near-optimal strategy for automated extraction of medication information from      clinical records

PMID- 20819855   - OBJECTIVE: Within the context of the Third i2b2 Workshop on Natural Language      Processing Challenges for Clinical Records, the authors  also referred to as 'the      i2b2 medication challenge team' or 'the i2b2 team' for short  organized a      community annotation experiment  DESIGN: For this experiment, the authors      released annotation guidelines and a small set of annotated discharge summaries        They asked the participants of the Third i2b2 Workshop to annotate 10 discharge      summaries per person; each discharge summary was annotated by two annotators from      two different teams, and a third annotator from a third team resolved      disagreements  MEASUREMENTS: In order to evaluate the reliability of the      annotations thus produced, the authors measured community inter-annotator     agreement and compared it with the inter-annotator agreement of expert annotators      when both the community and the expert annotators generated ground truth based on      pooled system outputs  For this purpose, the pool consisted of the three most      densely populated automatic annotations of each record  The authors also compared      the community inter-annotator agreement with expert inter-annotator agreement      when the experts annotated raw records without using the pool  Finally, they      measured the quality of the community ground truth by comparing it with the      expert ground truth  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the      community annotators achieved comparable inter-annotator agreement to expert      annotators, regardless of whether the experts annotated from the pool       Furthermore, the ground truth generated by the community obtained F-measures      above 0 90 against the ground truth of the experts, indicating the value of the      community as a source of high-quality ground truth even on intricate and      domain-specific annotation tasks

PMID- 20819854   - The Third i2b2 Workshop on Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical      Records focused on the identification of medications, their dosages, modes       routes  of administration, frequencies, durations, and reasons for     administration in discharge summaries  This challenge is referred to as the      medication challenge  For the medication challenge, i2b2 released detailed      annotation guidelines along with a set of annotated discharge summaries  Twenty      teams representing 23 organizations and nine countries participated in the      medication challenge  The teams produced rule-based, machine learning, and hybrid      systems targeted to the task  Although rule-based systems dominated the top 10,      the best performing system was a hybrid  Of all medication-related fields,      durations and reasons were the most difficult for all systems to detect  While      medications themselves were identified with better than 0 75 F-measure by all of       the top 10 systems, the best F-measure for durations and reasons were 0 525 and      0 459, respectively  State-of-the-art natural language processing systems go a      long way toward extracting medication names, dosages, modes, and frequencies       However, they are limited in recognizing duration and reason fields and would      benefit from future research

PMID- 20819851   - The objective of this review is to describe the implementation of human factors      principles for the design of alerts in clinical information systems  First, we      conduct a review of alarm systems to identify human factors principles that are      employed in the design and implementation of alerts  Second, we review the      medical informatics literature to provide examples of the implementation of human      factors principles in current clinical information systems using alerts to      provide medication decision support  Last, we suggest actionable recommendations       for delivering effective clinical decision support using alerts  A review of      studies from the medical informatics literature suggests that many basic human      factors principles are not followed, possibly contributing to the lack of      acceptance of alerts in clinical information systems  We evaluate the limitations      of current alerting philosophies and provide recommendations for improving      acceptance of alerts by incorporating human factors principles in their design

PMID- 20819850   - In 2005, the American Medical Informatics Association undertook a set of      activities relating to clinical decision support  CDS , with support from the      office of the national coordinator and the Agency for Healthcare Research and      Quality  They culminated in the release of the roadmap for national action on CDS      in 2006  This article assesses progress toward the short-term goals within the      roadmap, and recommends activities to continue to improve CDS adoption throughout      the United States  The report finds that considerable progress has been made in      the past four years, although significant work remains  Healthcare quality      organizations are increasingly recognizing the role of health information      technology in improving care, multi-site CDS demonstration projects are under     way, and there are growing incentives for adoption  Specific recommendations      include:  1  designating a national entity to coordinate CDS work and      collaboration;  2  developing approaches to monitor and track CDS adoption and      use;  3  defining and funding a CDS research agenda; and  4  updating the CDS      'critical path'

PMID- 20595315   - A system that monitors a region for a disease outbreak is called a disease      outbreak surveillance system  A spatial surveillance system searches for patterns      of disease outbreak in spatial subregions of the monitored region  A temporal      surveillance system looks for emerging patterns of outbreak disease by analyzing       how patterns have changed during recent periods of time  If a non-spatial,      non-temporal system could be converted to a spatio-temporal one, the performance       of the system might be improved in terms of early detection, accuracy, and      reliability  A Bayesian network framework is proposed for a class of space-time      surveillance systems called BNST  The framework is applied to a non-spatial,      non-temporal disease outbreak detection system called PC in order to create the      spatio-temporal system called PCTS  Differences in the detection performance of      PC and PCTS are examined  The results show that the spatio-temporal Bayesian      approach performs well, relative to the non-spatial, non-temporal approach

PMID- 20595314   - Health IT implementations often introduce radical changes to clinical work      processes and workflow  Prior research investigating this effect has shown      conflicting results  Recent time and motion studies have consistently found that       this impact is negligible; whereas qualitative studies have repeatedly revealed      negative end-user perceptions suggesting decreased efficiency and disrupted      workflow  We speculate that this discrepancy may be due in part to the design of       the time and motion studies, which is focused on measuring clinicians' 'time      expenditures' among different clinical activities rather than inspecting clinical      'workflow' from the true 'flow of the work' perspective  In this paper, we      present a set of new analytical methods consisting of workflow fragmentation      assessments, pattern recognition, and data visualization, which are accordingly      designed to uncover hidden regularities embedded in the flow of the work  Through      an empirical study, we demonstrate the potential value of these new methods in      enriching workflow analysis in clinical settings

PMID- 20595313   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a factorized version of the complement naive      Bayes  FCNB  classifier can reduce the time spent by experts reviewing journal      articles for inclusion in systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for disease      treatment  DESIGN: The proposed classifier was evaluated on a test collection      built from 15 systematic drug class reviews used in previous work  The FCNB      classifier was constructed to classify each article as containing high-quality,      drug class-specific evidence or not  Weight engineering  WE  techniques were      added to reduce underestimation for Medical Subject Headings  MeSH -based and      Publication Type  PubType -based features  Cross-validation experiments were      performed to evaluate the classifier's parameters and performance  MEASUREMENTS:       Work saved over sampling  WSS  at no less than a 95% recall was used as the main       measure of performance  RESULTS: The minimum workload reduction for a systematic       review for one topic, achieved with a FCNB/WE classifier, was 8 5%; the maximum      was 62 2% and the average over the 15 topics was 33 5%  This is 15 0% higher than      the average workload reduction obtained using a voting perceptron-based automated      citation classification system  CONCLUSION: The FCNB/WE classifier is simple,      easy to implement, and produces significantly better results in reducing the      workload than previously achieved  The results support it being a useful      algorithm for machine-learning-based automation of systematic reviews of drug      class efficacy for disease treatment

PMID- 20595312   - OBJECTIVE: To classify automatically lung tumor-node-metastases  TNM  cancer     stages from free-text pathology reports using symbolic rule-based classification       DESIGN: By exploiting report substructure and the symbolic manipulation of      systematized nomenclature of medicine-clinical terms  SNOMED CT  concepts in      reports, statements in free text can be evaluated for relevance against factors      relating to the staging guidelines  Post-coordinated SNOMED CT expressions based       on templates were defined and populated by concepts in reports, and tested for     subsumption by staging factors  The subsumption results were used to build logic       according to the staging guidelines to calculate the TNM stage  MEASUREMENTS: The      accuracy measure and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the TNM stages      classified by the symbolic rule-based system  The system was evaluated against a       database of multidisciplinary team staging decisions and a machine learning-based      text classification system using support vector machines  RESULTS: Overall      accuracy on a corpus of pathology reports for 718 lung cancer patients against a       database of pathological TNM staging decisions were 72%, 78%, and 94% for T, N,      and M staging, respectively  The system's performance was also comparable to      support vector machine classification approaches  CONCLUSION: A system to      classify lung TNM stages from free-text pathology reports was developed, and it      was verified that the symbolic rule-based approach using SNOMED CT can be used      for the extraction of key lung cancer characteristics from free-text reports       Future work will investigate the applicability of using the proposed methodology       for extracting other cancer characteristics and types

PMID- 20595311   - BACKGROUND: The RxNorm and NDF-RT  National Drug File Reference Terminology  are       a suite of terminology standards for clinical drugs designated for use in the US       federal government systems for electronic exchange of clinical health      information  Analyzing how different drug products described in these      terminologies are categorized into drug classes will help in their better     organization and classification of pharmaceutical information  METHODS: Mappings       between drug products in RxNorm and NDF-RT drug classes were extracted  Mappings       were also extracted between drug products in RxNorm to five high-level NDF-RT      categories: Chemical Structure; cellular or subcellular Mechanism of Action;      organ-level or system-level Physiologic Effect; Therapeutic Intent; and      Pharmacokinetics  Coverage for the mappings and the gaps were evaluated and      analyzed algorithmically  RESULTS: Approximately 54% of RxNorm drug products       Semantic Clinical Drugs  were found not to have a correspondence in NDF-RT       Similarly, approximately 45% of drug products in NDF-RT are missing from RxNorm,       most of which can be attributed to differences in dosage, strength, and route      form  Approximately 81% of Chemical Structure classes, 42% of Mechanism of Action      classes, 75% of Physiologic Effect classes, 76% of Therapeutic Intent classes,      and 88% of Pharmacokinetics classes were also found not to have any RxNorm drug      products classified under them  Finally, various issues regarding inconsistent      mappings between drug concepts were identified in both terminologies  CONCLUSION:      This investigation identified potential limitations of the existing      classification systems and various issues in specification of correspondences      between the concepts in RxNorm and NDF-RT  These proposals and methods provide      the preliminary steps in addressing some of the requirements

PMID- 20595310   - OBJECTIVE: Physician practices may adopt and use electronic prescribing  eRx  in       response to mandates, incentives, and perceived value of the technology  Yet, for     the most part, diffusion has been limited and geographically confined, and even      when adopted, use of eRx in many practices has been low  One explanation for this      phenomenon is that decision-makers in the practices possess different      technological viewpoints  frames  related to eRx and these frames have formed the      basis for the adoption decision, expectations about the technology, and patterns       of use  In this study eRx technological frames were examined  DESIGN: Focus      groups, direct observation, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with      physicians, practice managers, nurses, and other medical staff  MEASUREMENTS:      Focus groups were observed, taped, transcribed, and analyzed to reveal themes       These themes guided the observational visits and subsequent interviews  A      triangulation process was used to confirm the findings  RESULTS: Seven frames      emerged from the qualitative analysis ranging from positive to neutral to      negative:  1  eRx as an efficiency and effectiveness enhancing tool;  2  eRx as      the harbinger of new practices;  3  eRx as core to the clinical workflow;  4  eRx      as an administrative tool;  5  eRx: the artifact;  6  eRx as a necessary evil;      and  7  eRx as an unwelcome disruption  CONCLUSION: Frames provide a unique      perspective within which to explore the adoption and use of eRx and may explain      why perceptions of value vary greatly  Some frames facilitate effective use of      eRx while others impose barriers  Electronic prescribing can be viewed as a      transitional technology on the path to greater digitization at the physician      practice level  Understanding the impact of technological frames on the      effectiveness of eRx use may provide lessons for the implementation of future      health information technology innovations

PMID- 20595309   - OBJECTIVE: Advances in healthcare information technology have provided      opportunities to present data in new, more effective ways  In this study, we      designed a laboratory display that features small, data-dense graphics called      sparklines, which have recently been promoted as effective representations of      medical data but have not been well studied  The effect of this novel display on       physicians' interpretation of data was investigated  DESIGN: Twelve physicians      talked aloud as they assessed laboratory data from four patients in a pediatric      intensive care unit with the graph display and with a conventional table display       MEASUREMENTS: Verbalizations were coded based on the abnormal values and trends      identified for each lab variable  The correspondence of interpretations of      variables in each display was evaluated, and patterns were investigated across      participants  Assessment time was also analyzed  RESULTS: Physicians completed      assessments significantly faster with the graphical display  3 6 min vs 4 4 min,       p=0 042   When compared across displays, 37% of interpretations did not match       Graphs were more useful when the visual cues in tables did not provide trend      information, while slightly abnormal values were easier to identify with tables        CONCLUSIONS: Data presentation format can affect how physicians interpret      laboratory data  Graphic displays have several advantages over numeric displays      but are not always optimal  User, task and data characteristics should be      considered when designing information displays

PMID- 20595308   - BACKGROUND: Studies that have looked at the effectiveness of computerized      decision support systems to prevent drug-drug interactions have reported modest      results because of low response by the providers to the automated alerts       OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, within an inpatient computerized physician order entry       CPOE  system, the incremental effectiveness of an alert that required a response      from the provider, intended as a stronger intervention to prevent concurrent      orders of warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  NSAIDs   DESIGN:      Randomized clinical trial of 1963 clinicians assigned to either an intervention      group receiving a customized electronic alert requiring affirmative response or a      control group receiving a commercially available passive alert as part of the      CPOE  The study duration was 2 August 2006 to 15 December 2007  MEASUREMENTS:      Alert adherence was compared between study groups  RESULTS: The proportion of      desired ordering responses  ie, not reordering the alert-triggering drug after     firing  was lower in the intervention group  114/464  25%  customized alerts      issued  than in the control group  154/560  28%  passive alerts firing   The      adjusted OR of inappropriate ordering was 1 22  95% CI 0 69 to 2 16   CONCLUSION:      A customized CPOE alert that required a provider response had no effect in      reducing concomitant prescribing of NSAIDs and warfarin beyond that of the      commercially available passive alert received by the control group  New CPOE      alerts cannot be assumed to be effective in improving prescribing, and need      evaluation

PMID- 20595304   - Colorectal cancer  CRC  screening rates are low despite confirmed benefits  The      authors investigated the use of natural language processing  NLP  to identify      previous colonoscopy screening in electronic records from a random sample of 200       patients at least 50 years old  The authors developed algorithms to recognize      temporal expressions and 'status indicators', such as 'patient refused', or 'test      scheduled'  The new methods were added to the existing KnowledgeMap concept      identifier system, and the resulting system was used to parse electronic medical       records  EMR  to detect completed colonoscopies  Using as the 'gold standard'      expert physicians' manual review of EMR notes, the system identified timing      references with a recall of 0 91 and precision of 0 95, colonoscopy status      indicators with a recall of 0 82 and precision of 0 95, and references to      actually completed colonoscopies with recall of 0 93 and precision of 0 95  The      system was superior to using colonoscopy billing codes alone  Health services      researchers and clinicians may find NLP a useful adjunct to traditional methods      to detect CRC screening status  Further investigations must validate extension of      NLP approaches for other types of CRC screening applications

PMID- 20595302   - The English version of the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, has been recently      reported to be the prominent source of online health information  However, there       is little information concerning the quality of information found in Wikipedia       Therefore, we created a questionnaire asking for scope, completeness, and      accuracy of information found on osteosarcoma  Three independent observers tested      the English version of Wikipedia, as well as the patient version and the health      professional version of the US National Cancer Institute  NCI  website  Answers      were verified with authoritative resources and international guidelines  The      results of our study demonstrate that the quality of osteosarcoma-related      information found in the English Wikipedia is good but inferior to the patient      information provided by the NCI  Therefore, non-peer-reviewed commonly used      websites offering health information, such as Wikipedia, should include links to       more definitive sources, such as those maintained by the NCI and professional      international organizations on healthcare treatments  Furthermore, frequent      checks should make sure such external links are to the highest quality and to the      best-maintained aggregate sites on a given healthcare topic

PMID- 20595301   - Institutions, providers, and informaticians now encourage healthcare consumers to      take greater control of their own healthcare needs through improved health and      wellness activities, internet-based education and support groups, and personal      health records  The author believes that "untethering" all of these activities      from provider-based record systems has introduced a form of unhealthy consumer     populism  Conversely, integrating these activities in a coordinated manner can      sustain both consumer empowerment and consumer well-being

PMID- 20442156   - The authors developed a computerized algorithm that estimates 'who transmits to      whom'--that is, the likeliest transmission paths during an outbreak of      person-to-person transmitted illness  This algorithm uses basic information about      natural history of the disease, population structure, and chronology of observed       symptoms  To assess the algorithm efficacy, the authors built a simulator with      parameters describing the disease and the population to simulate random outbreaks      of influenza  The algorithm's performance was compared with three reference      methods that simulated how human operators would handle such situations  For any       size of outbreak, the algorithm outperformed the reference methods and provided a      higher proportion of cases for whom the source subject who transmitted infection       was identified  The authors also illustrated applicability of the algorithm for     describing outbreaks of influenza in nursing homes  The use of this algorithm to       draw transmission maps in investigations of outbreaks with person-to-person      transmitted agents could potentially guide public health measures regarding the      control of such outbreaks

PMID- 20442154   - Duplication of medical testing results in a financial burden to the healthcare      system  Authors undertook a retrospective review of duplicate testing on patients      receiving coordinated care across two institutions, each with its own electronic       medical record system  In order to determine whether duplicate testing occurred      and if such testing was clinically indicated, authors analyzed records of 85      patients transferred from one site to the other between January 1, 2006 and      December 31, 2007  Duplication of testing  repeat within 12 hours  was found in      32% of the cases examined; 20% of cases had at least one duplicate test not      clinically indicated  While previous studies document that inaccessibility of      paper records leads to duplicate testing when patients are transferred between      care facilities, the current study suggests that incomplete electronic record      transfer among incompatible electronic medical record systems can also lead to      potentially costly duplicate testing behaviors  The authors believe that      interoperable systems with integrated decision support could assist in minimizing      duplication of testing at time of patient transfers

PMID- 20442153   - Family history information has emerged as an increasingly important tool for     clinical care and research  While recent standards provide for structured entry      of family history, many clinicians record family history data in text  The      authors sought to characterize family history information within clinical      documents to assess the adequacy of existing models and create a more      comprehensive model for its representation  Models were evaluated on 100      documents containing 238 sentences and 410 statements relevant to family history       Most statements were of family member plus disease or of disease only  Statement       coverage was 91%, 77%, and 95% for HL7 Clinical Genomics Family History Model,      HL7 Clinical Statement Model, and the newly created Merged Family History Model,       respectively  Negation  18%  and inexact family member specification  9 5%       occurred commonly  Overall, both HL7 models could represent most family history      statements in clinical reports; however, refinements are needed to represent the       full breadth of family history data

PMID- 20442152   - OBJECTIVE: To study how social interactions influence physician adoption of an      electronic health records  EHR  system  DESIGN: A social network survey was used       to delineate the structure of social interactions among 40 residents and 15      attending physicians in an ambulatory primary care practice  Social network      analysis was then applied to relate the interaction structures to individual      physicians' utilization rates of an EHR system  MEASUREMENTS: The social network       survey assessed three distinct types of interaction structures: professional      network based on consultation on patient care-related matters; friendship network      based on personal intimacy; and perceived influence network based on a person's      perception of how other people have affected her intention to adopt the EHR     system  EHR utilization rates were measured as the proportion of patient visits      in which sentinel use events consisting of patient data documentation or     retrieval activities were recorded  The usage data were collected over a time      period of 14 months from computer-recorded audit trail logs  RESULTS: Neither the      professional nor the perceived influence network is correlated with EHR usage       The structure of the friendship network significantly influenced individual      physicians' adoption of the EHR system  Residents who occupied similar social      positions in the friendship network shared similar EHR utilization rates       p<0 05   In other words, residents who had personal friends in common tended to       develop comparable levels of EHR adoption  This effect is particularly prominent       when the mutual personal friends of these 'socially similar' residents were      attending physicians  p<0 001   CONCLUSIONS: Social influence affecting physician      adoption of EHR seems to be predominantly conveyed through interactions with      personal friends rather than interactions in professional settings

PMID- 20442151   - OBJECTIVE: De-identified clinical data in standardized form  eg, diagnosis      codes , derived from electronic medical records, are increasingly combined with      research data  eg, DNA sequences  and disseminated to enable scientific      investigations  This study examines whether released data can be linked with      identified clinical records that are accessible via various resources to      jeopardize patients' anonymity, and the ability of popular privacy protection      methodologies to prevent such an attack  DESIGN: The study experimentally      evaluates the re-identification risk of a de-identified sample of Vanderbilt's      patient records involved in a genome-wide association study  It also measures the      level of protection from re-identification, and data utility, provided by      suppression and generalization  MEASUREMENT: Privacy protection is quantified      using the probability of re-identifying a patient in a larger population through       diagnosis codes  Data utility is measured at a dataset level, using the      percentage of retained information, as well as its description, and at a patient       level, using two metrics based on the difference between the distribution of      Internal Classification of Disease  ICD  version 9 codes before and after     applying privacy protection  RESULTS: More than 96% of 2800 patients' records are      shown to be uniquely identified by their diagnosis codes with respect to a      population of 1 2 million patients  Generalization is shown to reduce further the      percentage of de-identified records by less than 2%, and over 99% of the      three-digit ICD-9 codes need to be suppressed to prevent re-identification       CONCLUSIONS: Popular privacy protection methods are inadequate to deliver a      sufficiently protected and useful result when sharing data derived from complex      clinical systems  The development of alternative privacy protection models is      thus required

PMID- 20442150   - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors in the nursing work domain that contribute to the       problem of inpatient falls, aside from patient risk, using cognitive work      analysis  DESIGN: A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were used to      identify work constraints imposed on nurses, which may underlie patient falls       MEASUREMENTS: Data collection was done on a neurology unit staffed by 27      registered nurses and utilized field observations, focus groups, time-motion      studies and written surveys  AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Culture, NASA-TLX,      and custom Nursing Knowledge of Fall Prevention Subscale   RESULTS: Four major     constraints were identified that inhibit nurses' ability to prevent patient      falls  All constraints relate to work processes and the physical work      environment, opposed to safety culture or nursing knowledge, as currently      emphasized  The constraints were: cognitive 'head data', temporal workload,      inconsistencies in written and verbal transfer of patient data, and limitations      in the physical environment  To deal with these constraints, the nurses tend to      employ four workarounds: written and mental chunking schemas, bed alarms,      informal querying of the previous care nurse, and informal video and audio      surveillance  These workarounds reflect systemic design flaws and may only be      minimally effective in decreasing risk to patients  CONCLUSION: Cognitive      engineering techniques helped identify seemingly hidden constraints in the work      domain that impact the problem of patient falls  System redesign strategies aimed      at improving work processes and environmental limitations hold promise for     decreasing the incidence of falls in inpatient nursing units

PMID- 20442149   - OBJECTIVE: Lack of dose adjustment for renally cleared drugs in the presence of      poor renal function is a common problem in the hospital setting  The absence of a      clinical decision support system  CDSS  from direct clinician workflows such as      computerized provider order entry  CPOE  hinders the uptake of CDSS  This study      implemented CDSS in an environment independent of CPOE, introduced to prescribers      via academic detailing, to address the dosing of renally cleared drugs  DESIGN:      GFR+ was designed to automatically calculate and update renal function, doses of       key drugs adjusted for renal function, and highlight clinically significant      decreases in renal function  Prescribers were made aware of GFR+, its navigation,      and surrounding clinical issues, using academic detailing  MEASUREMENT: The rate       of dosing conformity and management for key renally cleared drugs in hospitalized      patients, before and after GFR+ implementation  RESULTS: Improvements were seen      in dosing conformity for enoxaparin  from 68% to 86%, p=0 03 , gentamicin       63-87%, p=0 01 , and vancomycin  47-77%, p=0 07 , as well as the appropriate use      of gentamicin therapeutic drug monitoring  70-90%, p=0 02   During episodes of      acute renal impairment, renally cleared drugs were held on 38% of instances in      the pre-intervention period compared with 62% post-intervention  p=0 01        CONCLUSION: Clinical decision support implemented with academic detailing      improved dosing conformity and management of key renally cleared drugs in a      hospitalized population  Academic detailing should be strongly considered to      facilitate the introduction of CDSS systems that cannot be placed directly into      the clinician workflow

PMID- 20442148   - Under the provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical      Health act providers need to demonstrate their 'meaningful use' of electronic      health record systems' health information exchange  HIE  capability  HIE usage is      not a simple construct, but the choice of its measurement must attend to the      users, context, and objectives of the system being examined  This review examined      how usage is reported in the existing literature and also what conceptualizations      of usage might best reflect the nature and objectives of HIE  While existing      literature on HIE usage included a diverse set of measures, most were      theoretically weak, did not attend to the interplay of measure, level of analysis      and architectural strategy, and did not reflect how HIE usage affected the actual      process of care  Attention to these issues will provide greater insight into the       effects of previously inaccessible information on medical decision-making and the      process of care

PMID- 20442146   - Recent federal policies and actions support the adoption of health information      exchange  HIE  in order to improve healthcare by addressing fragmented personal      health information  However, concerted efforts at facilitating HIE have existed      for over two decades in this country  The lessons of these experiences include a       recurrence of barriers and challenges beyond those associated with technology       Without new strategies, the current support and methods of facilitating HIE may      not address these barriers

PMID- 20442144   - Described are the changes to ICD-10-CM and PCS and potential challenges regarding      their use in the US for financial and administrative transaction coding under     HIPAA in 2013  Using author constructed derivative databases for ICD-10-CM and      PCS it was found that ICD-10-CM's overall term content is seven times larger than      ICD-9-CM: only 3 2 times larger in those chapters describing disease or symptoms,      but 14 1 times larger in injury and cause sections  A new multi-axial approach      ICD-10-PCS increased size 18-fold from its prior version  New ICD-10-CM and PCS      reflect a corresponding improvement in specificity and content  The forthcoming      required national switch to these new administrative codes, coupled with nearly      simultaneous widespread introduction of clinical systems and terminologies,      requires substantial changes in US administrative systems  Through coordination      of terminologies, the systems using them, and healthcare objectives, we can      maximize the improvement achieved and engender beneficial data reuse for multiple      purposes, with minimal transformations

PMID- 20442140   - Current models for implementing electronic health records  EHRs  in      resource-limited settings may not be scalable because they fail to address      human-resource and cost constraints  This paper describes an implementation model      which relies on shared responsibility between local sites and an external      three-pronged support infrastructure consisting of:  1  a national technical      expertise center,  2  an implementer's community, and  3  a developer's      community  This model was used to implement an open-source EHR in three Ugandan      HIV-clinics  Pre-post time-motion study at one site revealed that Primary Care      Providers spent a third less time in direct and indirect care of patients       p<0 001  and 40% more time on personal activities  p=0 09  after EHRs      implementation  Time spent by previously enrolled patients with non-clinician      staff fell by half  p=0 004  and with pharmacy by 63%  p<0 001   Surveyed      providers were highly satisfied with the EHRs and its support infrastructure       This model offers a viable approach for broadly implementing EHRs in      resource-limited settings

PMID- 20190068   - This pilot study explores the impact of a health topics overview  HTO  on reading      comprehension  The HTO is generated automatically based on the presence of      Unified Medical Language System terms  In a controlled setting, we presented      health texts and posed 15 questions for each  We compared performance with and      without the HTO  The answers were available in the text, but not always in the      HTO  Our study  n=48  showed that consumers with low health literacy or high      stress performed poorly when the HTO was available without linking directly to      the answer  They performed better with direct links in the HTO or when the HTO      was not available at all  Consumers with high health literacy or low stress      performed better regardless of the availability of the HTO  Our data suggests      that vulnerable consumers relied solely on the HTO when it was available and were      misled when it did not provide the answer

PMID- 20190067   - Alerting providers to public health situations requires timeliness and      context-relevance, both lacking in current systems  Incorporating decision      support tools into electronic health records may provide a way to deploy public      health alerts to clinicians at the point of care  A timely process for responding      to Health Alert Network messages sent by the New York City Department of Health      and Mental Hygiene was developed by a network of community health centers  Alerts      with order sets and recommended actions were created to notify primary care      providers of local disease outbreaks  The process, effect, and lessons learned      from alerts for Legionella, toxogenic E coli, and measles outbreaks are      described  Electronic alerts have the potential to improve management of diseases      during an outbreak, including appropriate laboratory testing, management      guidance, and diagnostic assistance as well as to enhance bi-directional data      exchange between clinical and public health organizations

PMID- 20190064   - Objective To determine whether a diabetes case management telemedicine      intervention reduced healthcare expenditures, as measured by Medicare claims, and      to assess the costs of developing and implementing the telemedicine intervention       Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and      Telemedicine  IDEATel , a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case      management of diabetes to usual care  Participants were aged 55 years or older,      and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York      State  Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for     up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until      December 31, 2006  whichever happened first   We also analyzed study expenditures      for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years  February 28, 2000-      February 27, 2006   Results Mean annual Medicare payments  SE  were similar in      the usual care and telemedicine groups, $9040  $386  and $9669  $443  per     participant, respectively  p>0 05   Sensitivity analyses, including      stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and      semi-parametric weighting by probability of dropping-out, rendered similar     results  Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine      intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of $622 per participant/month        Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in      Medicare claims in this medically underserved population  The cost of      implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special      purpose hardware and software costs required at the time  Lower implementation      costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for     telemedicine case management to be more widely used

PMID- 20190063   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the patient-centeredness of personal health records  PHR       and offer recommendations for best practice guidelines  DESIGN: Semi-structured      interviews were conducted in seven large early PHR adopter organizations in 2007       Organizations were purposively selected to represent a variety of US settings,      including medium and large hospitals, ambulatory care facilities, insurers and      health plans, government departments, and commercial sectors  MEASUREMENTS:      Patient-centeredness was assessed against a framework of care that includes:  1        respect for patient values, preferences, and expressed needs;  2  information and      education;  3  access to care;  4  emotional support to relieve fear and anxiety;       5  involvement of family and friends;  6  continuity and secure transition      between healthcare providers;  7  physical comfort;  8  coordination of care       Within this framework we used evidence for patient preferences  where it exists        to compare existing PHR policies, and propose a best practice model  RESULTS:      Most organizations enable many patient-centered functions such as data access for     proxies and minors  No organization allows patient views of clinical progress      notes, and turnaround times for PHR reporting of normal laboratory results can be      up to 7 days  CONCLUSION: Findings suggest patient-centeredness for personal      health records can be improved, and recommendations are made for best practice      guidelines

PMID- 20190061   - Maintaining a large controlled biomedical vocabulary requires ensuring the      content's internal consistency  This is done through rules, specified by the      vocabulary's curators, which denote how the vocabulary's concepts should be      defined  When individual organizations deploy such vocabularies, local concepts      are typically added and linked to concepts in the main vocabulary: the process of      maintaining and linking local content should follow the same rules  The operation      of content-maintenance software can be facilitated by maintaining such rules in      computable form  In this paper, we demonstrate how to implement computable rules       for attribute usage in SNOMED CT using a table-driven approach where a given rule      is expressed as one or more rows in a table and is consulted by generic code       This approach, which is tailored to database implementations, is computationally       efficient and allows new attribute-definition rules to be created as data while      needing minimal or no code modification

PMID- 20190060   - Clinicians face an increasing volume of biomedical data  Assessing the efficacy      of systems that enable accurate and timely clinical decision making merits      corresponding attention  This paper discusses the multiple-reader multiple-case       MRMC  experimental design and linear mixed models as means of assessing and      comparing decision accuracy and latency  time  for decision tasks in which      clinician readers must interpret visual displays of data  These tools can assess       and compare decision accuracy and latency  time   These experimental and      statistical techniques, used extensively in radiology imaging studies, offer a      number of practical and analytic advantages over more traditional quantitative      methods such as percent-correct measurements and ANOVAs, and are recommended for       their statistical efficiency and generalizability  An example analysis using      readily available, free, and commercial statistical software is provided as an      appendix  While these techniques are not appropriate for all evaluation      questions, they can provide a valuable addition to the evaluative toolkit of      medical informatics research

PMID- 20190059   - OBJECTIVE: Many healthcare organizations follow data protection policies that      specify which patient identifiers must be suppressed to share "de-identified"      records  Such policies, however, are often applied without knowledge of the risk       of "re-identification"  The goals of this work are:  1  to estimate      re-identification risk for data sharing policies of the Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  Privacy Rule; and  2  to evaluate the       risk of a specific re-identification attack using voter registration lists       MEASUREMENTS: We define several risk metrics:  1  expected number of      re-identifications;  2  estimated proportion of a population in a group of size g      or less, and  3  monetary cost per re-identification  For each US state, we      estimate the risk posed to hypothetical datasets, protected by the HIPAA Safe      Harbor and Limited Dataset policies by an attacker with full knowledge of patient      identifiers and with limited knowledge in the form of voter registries  RESULTS:       The percentage of a state's population estimated to be vulnerable to unique      re-identification  ie, g=1  when protected via Safe Harbor and Limited Datasets      ranges from 0 01% to 0 25% and 10% to 60%, respectively  In the voter attack,      this number drops for many states, and for some states is 0%, due to the variable      availability of voter registries in the real world  We also find that      re-identification cost ranges from $0 to $17,000, further confirming risk      variability  CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates that blanket protection policies,      such as Safe Harbor, leave different organizations vulnerable to      re-identification at different rates  It provides justification for locally      performed re-identification risk estimates prior to sharing data

PMID- 20190058   - OBJECTIVE: De-identified medical records are critical to biomedical research       Text de-identification software exists, including "resynthesis" components that      replace real identifiers with synthetic identifiers  The goal of this research is      to evaluate the effectiveness and examine possible bias introduced by resynthesis      on de-identification software  DESIGN: We evaluated the open-source MITRE      Identification Scrubber Toolkit, which includes a resynthesis capability, with      clinical text from Vanderbilt University Medical Center patient records  We      investigated four record classes from over 500 patients' files, including      laboratory reports, medication orders, discharge summaries and clinical notes  We      trained and tested the de-identification tool on real and resynthesized records        MEASUREMENTS: We measured performance in terms of precision, recall, F-measure      and accuracy for the detection of protected health identifiers as designated by      the HIPAA Safe Harbor Rule  RESULTS: The de-identification tool was trained and      tested on a collection of real and resynthesized Vanderbilt records  Results for       training and testing on the real records were 0 990 accuracy and 0 960 F-measure       The results improved when trained and tested on resynthesized records with 0 998       accuracy and 0 980 F-measure but deteriorated moderately when trained on real      records and tested on resynthesized records with 0 989 accuracy 0 862 F-measure        Moreover, the results declined significantly when trained on resynthesized      records and tested on real records with 0 942 accuracy and 0 728 F-measure       CONCLUSION: The de-identification tool achieves high accuracy when training and      test sets are homogeneous  ie, both real or resynthesized records   The      resynthesis component regularizes the data to make them less "realistic,"      resulting in loss of performance particularly when training on resynthesized data      and testing on real data

PMID- 20190057   - OBJECTIVE: There has been a consistent concern about the inadvertent disclosure      of personal information through peer-to-peer file sharing applications, such as      Limewire and Morpheus  Examples of personal health and financial information      being exposed have been published  We wanted to estimate the extent to which      personal health information  PHI  is being disclosed in this way, and compare      that to the extent of disclosure of personal financial information  PFI   DESIGN:      After careful review and approval of our protocol by our institutional research      ethics board, files were downloaded from peer-to-peer file sharing networks and      manually analyzed for the presence of PHI and PFI  The geographic region of the      IP addresses was determined, and classified as either USA or Canada  MEASUREMENT:      We estimated the proportion of files that contain personal health and financial      information for each region  We also estimated the proportion of search terms      that return files with personal health and financial information  We ascertained       and discuss the ethical issues related to this study  RESULTS: Approximately 0 4%      of Canadian IP addresses had PHI, as did 0 5% of US IP addresses  There was more       disclosure of financial information, at 1 7% of Canadian IP addresses and 4 7% of      US IP addresses  An analysis of search terms used in these file sharing networks       showed that a small percentage of the terms would return PHI and PFI files  ie,      there are people successfully searching for PFI and PHI on the peer-to-peer file       sharing networks   CONCLUSION: There is a real risk of inadvertent disclosure of       PHI through peer-to-peer file sharing networks, although the risk is not as large      as for PFI  Anyone keeping PHI on their computers should avoid installing file      sharing applications on their computers, or if they have to use such tools,      actively manage the risks of inadvertent disclosure of their, their family's,      their clients', or patients' PHI

PMID- 20190056   - An object identifier  OID  has a central utility in providing a traceable source       for the meaning of an identifier appearing in a cross-system communication  The      views in this paper illustrate the problems with using the present OID      registration system as a reliable source for the identifier, the confusion that      the use of an OID introduces in messages, and the redundancy that the OID      introduces at the expense of increased message size and no new content  In      promoting clearly defined cross-system communication identifiers, Health Level 7       developed a standard that required use of OIDs outside of network addressing       This standard and its propagation by others may have paradoxically added more      confusion than clarity

PMID- 20190055   - Healthcare is increasingly dependent upon information technology  IT , but the      accumulation of data has outpaced our capacity to use it to improve operating      efficiency, clinical quality, and financial effectiveness  Moreover, hospitals      have lagged in adopting thoughtful analytic approaches that would allow      operational leaders and providers to capitalize upon existing data stores  In      this manuscript, we propose a fundamental re-evaluation of strategic IT      investments in healthcare, with the goal of increasing efficiency, reducing      costs, and improving outcomes through the targeted application of health      analytics  We also present three case studies that illustrate the use of health      analytics to leverage pre-existing data resources to support improvements in      patient safety and quality of care, to increase the accuracy of billing and      collection, and support emerging health issues  We believe that such active      investment in health analytics will prove essential to realizing the full promise      of investments in electronic clinical systems

PMID- 20064811   - UW Medicine teaching hospitals have seen a move from paper to electronic      physician inpatient notes, after improving the availability of workstations, and       wireless laptops and the technical infrastructure supporting the electronic      medical record  EMR   The primary driver for the transition was to unify the      medical record for all disciplines in one location  The main barrier faced was      the time required to enter notes, which was addressed with data-rich templates      tailored to rounding workflow, simplified login and other measures  After a      2-year transition, nearly all physician notes for hospitalized patients are now      entered electronically, approximately 1500 physician notes per day  Remaining      challenges include time for note entry, and the perception that notes may be more      difficult to understand and to find within the EMR  In general, the transition      from paper to electronic notes has been regarded as valuable to patient care and       hospital operations

PMID- 20064809   - In today's environment, providers are extremely time-constrained  Assembling      relevant contextual data to make decisions on laboratory results can take a      significant amount of time from the day  The Regenstrief Institute has created a       system which leverages data within Indiana Health Information Exchange's  IHIE's       repository, the Indiana Network for Patient Care  INPC , to provide      well-organized and contextual information on returning laboratory results to      outpatient providers  The system described here uses data extracted from INPC to       add historical test results, medication-dispensing events, visit information, and      clinical reminders to traditional laboratory result reports  These "Enhanced      Laboratory Reports"  ELRs  are seamlessly delivered to outpatient practices      connected through IHIE via the DOCS4DOCS clinical messaging service  All      practices, including those without electronic medical record systems, can receive      ELRs  In this paper, the design and implementation issues in creating this system      are discussed, and generally favorable preliminary results of attitudes by      providers towards ELRs are reported

PMID- 20064805   - OBJECTIVE: Electronic medical records  EMRs  facilitate abnormal test result      communication through "alert" notifications  The aim was to evaluate how primary       care providers  PCPs  manage alerts related to critical diagnostic test results      on their EMR screens, and compare alert-management strategies of providers with      high versus low rates of timely follow-up of results  DESIGN: 28 PCPs from a      large, tertiary care Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  were purposively      sampled according to their rates of timely follow-up of alerts, determined in a      previous study  Using techniques from cognitive task analysis, participants were       interviewed about how and when they manage alerts, focusing on four     alert-management features to filter, sort and reduce unnecessary alerts on their       EMR screens  RESULTS: Provider knowledge of alert-management features ranged      between 4% and 75%  Almost half  46%  of providers did not use any of these      features, and none used more than two  Providers with higher versus lower rates      of timely follow-up used the four features similarly, except one  customizing      alert notifications   Providers with low rates of timely follow-up tended to      manually scan the alert list and process alerts heuristically using their     clinical judgment  Additionally, 46% of providers used at least one workaround      strategy to manage alerts  CONCLUSION: Considerable heterogeneity exists in      provider use of alert-management strategies; specific strategies may be      associated with lower rates of timely follow-up  Standardization of      alert-management strategies including improving provider knowledge of appropriate      tools in the EMR to manage alerts could reduce the lack of timely follow-up of      abnormal diagnostic test results

PMID- 20064804   - Objective: To assess physicians' attitudes toward health information exchange       HIE  and physicians' willingness to pay to participate in HIE  DESIGN: We      conducted a cross-sectional mail survey of 1296 licensed physicians  77% response      rate  in Massachusetts in 2007  MEASUREMENTS: Perceptions of the potential      effects of HIE on healthcare costs, quality of care, clinicians' time, patients'       privacy concerns, and willingness to pay for HIE  RESULTS: After excluding 253      physicians who did not see any outpatients, we analyzed 1043 responses  Overall,       70% indicated that HIE would reduce costs, while 86% said it would improve      quality and 76% believed that it would save time  On the other hand, 16% reported      being very concerned about HIE's effect on privacy, while 55 0% were somewhat      concerned and 29% not at all concerned  Slightly more than half of the physicians       54%  said they would be willing to pay an unspecified monthly fee to participate      in HIE, but only 37% said they would be willing to pay $150 per month for it       Primary care physicians and those in larger practices tended to have more      positive attitudes toward HIE  CONCLUSIONS: Physicians perceive that HIE will      have generally positive effects, though a considerable fraction harbor concerns      about privacy  While physicians may be willing to participate in HIE, they are      not consistently willing to pay to participate  HIE business models that require       substantial physician subscription fees may face significant challenges

PMID- 20064803   - OBJECTIVE: Regional Health Information Organizations  RHIOs  will likely play a      key role in our nation's effort to catalyze health information exchange  Yet we      know little about why some efforts succeed while others fail  We sought to      identify factors associated with RHIO viability  DESIGN: Using data from a      national survey of RHIOs that we conducted in mid-2008, we examined factors      associated with becoming operational and factors associated with financial      viability  We used multivariate logistic regression models to identify unique      predictors  MEASUREMENTS: We classified RHIOs actively facilitating data exchange      as operational and measured financial viability as the percent of operating costs      covered by revenue from participants in data exchange  0-24%, 25-74%, 75-100%        Predictors included breadth of participants, breadth of data exchanged, whether     the RHIO focused on a specific population, whether RHIO participants had a      history of collaborating, and sources of revenue during the planning phase       RESULTS: Exchanging a narrow set of data and involving a broad group of      stakeholders were independently associated with a higher likelihood of being      operational  Involving hospitals and ambulatory physicians, and securing early      funding from participants were associated with a higher likelihood of financial      viability, while early grant funding seemed to diminish the likelihood       CONCLUSION: Finding ways to help RHIOs become operational and self-sustaining      will bolster the current approach to nationwide health information exchange  Our       work suggests that convening a broad coalition of stakeholders to focus on a      narrow set of data is an important step in helping RHIOs become operational       Convincing stakeholders to financially commit early in the process may help RHIOs      become self-sustaining

PMID- 20064802   - OBJECTIVES: Improvements in electronic health record  EHR  system development      will require an understanding of psychiatric clinicians' views on EHR system      acceptability, including effects on psychotherapy communications, data-recording       behaviors, data accessibility versus security and privacy, data quality and      clarity, communications with medical colleagues, and stigma  DESIGN:      Multidisciplinary development of a survey instrument targeting psychiatric      clinicians who recently switched to EHR system use, focus group testing, data      analysis, and data reliability testing  MEASUREMENTS: Survey of 120      university-based, outpatient mental health clinicians, with 56  47%  responding,       conducted 18 months after transition from a paper to an EHR system  RESULTS:      Factor analysis gave nine item groupings that overlapped strongly with five a      priori domains  Respondents both praised and criticized the EHR system  A strong       majority  81%  felt that open therapeutic communications were preserved       Regarding data quality, content, and privacy, clinicians  63%  were less willing       to record highly confidential information and disagreed  83%  with including      their own psychiatric records among routinely accessed EHR systems  LIMITATIONS:       single time point; single academic medical center clinic setting; modest sample      size; lack of prior instrument validation; survey conducted in 2005  CONCLUSIONS:      In an academic medical center clinic, the presence of electronic records was not       seen as a dramatic impediment to therapeutic communications  Concerns regarding      privacy and data security were significant, and may contribute to reluctances to       adopt electronic records in other settings  Further study of clinicians' views      and use patterns may be helpful in guiding development and deployment of      electronic records systems

PMID- 20064801   - OBJECTIVE: Although electronic notes have advantages compared to handwritten      notes, they take longer to write and promote information redundancy in electronic      health records  EHRs   We sought to quantify redundancy in clinical documentation      by studying collections of physician notes in an EHR  DESIGN AND METHODS: We      implemented a retrospective design to gather all electronic admission, progress,       resident signout and discharge summary notes written during 100 randomly selected      patient admissions within a 6 month period  We modified and applied a Levenshtein      edit-distance algorithm to align and compare the documents written for each of      the 100 admissions  We then identified and measured the amount of text duplicated      from previous notes  Finally, we manually reviewed the content that was conserved      between note types in a subsample of notes  MEASUREMENTS: We measured the amount       of new information in a document, which was calculated as the number of words      that did not match with previous documents divided by the length, in words, of      the document  Results are reported as the percentage of information in a document      that had been duplicated from previously written documents  RESULTS: Signout and       progress notes proved to be particularly redundant, with an average of 78% and      54% information duplicated from previous documents respectively  There was also      significant information duplication between document types  eg, from an admission      note to a progress note   CONCLUSION: The study established the feasibility of      exploring redundancy in the narrative record with a known sequence alignment      algorithm used frequently in the field of bioinformatics  The findings provide a       foundation for studying the usefulness and risks of redundancy in the EHR

PMID- 20064800   - OBJECTIVE: To formulate a model for translating manual infection control      surveillance methods to automated, algorithmic approaches  DESIGN: We propose a      model for creating electronic surveillance algorithms by translating existing      manual surveillance practices into automated electronic methods  Our model      suggests that three dimensions of expert knowledge be consulted: clinical,      surveillance, and informatics  Once collected, knowledge should be applied      through a process of conceptualization, synthesis, programming, and testing       RESULTS: We applied our framework to central vascular catheter associated      bloodstream infection surveillance, a major healthcare performance outcome      measure  We found that despite major barriers such as differences in availability      of structured data, in types of databases used and in semantic representation of       clinical terms, bloodstream infection detection algorithms could be deployed at      four very diverse medical centers  CONCLUSIONS: We present a framework that      translates existing practice-manual infection detection-to an automated process      for surveillance  Our experience details barriers and solutions discovered during      development of electronic surveillance for central vascular catheter associated      bloodstream infections at four hospitals in a variety of data environments       Moving electronic surveillance to the next level-availability at a majority of      acute care hospitals nationwide-would be hastened by the incorporation of      necessary data elements, vocabularies and standards into commercially available      electronic health records

PMID- 20064799   - Clinicians are required to report selected conditions to public health      authorities within a stipulated amount of time  The current reporting process is       mostly paper-based and inefficient and may lead to delays in case investigation        As electronic medical records become more prevalent, electronic case reporting is      becoming increasingly feasible  However, there is no existing standard for the      electronic transmission of case reports from healthcare to public health      entities  We identified the major requirements of electronic case reports and      verified that the requirements support the work processes of the local health      departments  We propose an extendable standards-based model to electronically      transmit case information and associated laboratory information from healthcare      to public health entities  The HL7 v2 5 message model is currently being      implemented to transmit electronic case reports from Intermountain Healthcare to       the Utah Department of Health

PMID- 20064798   - There is wide variability in the use and adoption of recommendations generated by      computerized clinical decision support systems  CDSSs  despite the benefits they       may bring to clinical practice  We conducted a systematic review to explore the      barriers to, and facilitators of, CDSS uptake by physicians to guide prescribing       decisions  We identified 58 studies by searching electronic databases       1990-2007   Factors impacting on CDSS use included: the availability of      hardware, technical support and training; integration of the system into      workflows; and the relevance and timeliness of the clinical messages  Further,      systems that were endorsed by colleagues, minimized perceived threats to      professional autonomy, and did not compromise doctor-patient interactions were      accepted by users  Despite advances in technology and CDSS sophistication, most      factors were consistently reported over time and across ambulatory and      institutional settings  Such factors must be addressed when deploying CDSSs so      that improvements in uptake, practice and patient outcomes may be achieved

PMID- 20064794   - Statistics is an essential aspect of biomedical informatics  To examine the use      of statistics in informatics research, a literature review of recent articles in       two high-impact factor biomedical informatics journals, the Journal of American      Medical Informatics Association  JAMIA  and the International Journal of Medical       Informatics was conducted  The use of statistical methods in each paper was      examined  Articles of original investigations from 2000 to 2007 were reviewed       For each journal, the results by statistical methods were analyzed as:      descriptive, elementary, multivariable, other regression, machine learning, and      other statistics  For both journals, descriptive statistics were most often used       Elementary statistics such as t tests, chi 2 , and Wilcoxon tests were much more       frequent in JAMIA, while machine learning approaches such as decision trees and      support vector machines were similar in occurrence across the journals  Also, the      use of diagnostic statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and      recall, was more frequent in JAMIA  These results highlight the use of statistics      in informatics and the need for biomedical informatics scientists to have, as a      minimum, proficiency in descriptive and elementary statistics

PMID- 19717807   - OBJECTIVE: Spatio and/or temporal surveillance systems are designed to monitor     the ongoing appearance of disease cases in space and time, and to detect      potential disturbances in either dimension  Patient addresses are sometimes      reported at some level of geographic aggregation, for example by ZIP code or     census tract  While this aggregation has the advantage of protecting patient      privacy, it also risks compromising statistical efficiency  This paper     investigated the variation in power to detect a change in the spatial      distribution in the presence of spatial aggregation  METHODS: The authors      generated 400,000 spatial datasets with varying location and spread of simulated       spatial disturbances, both on a purely synthetic uniform population, and on a      heterogeneous population, representing hospital admissions to three community      hospitals in Cape Cod, Massachusetts  The authors evaluated the power of the      M-statistic to detect spatial disturbances, comparing the use of exact spatial      locations versus twelve different levels of aggregation, where the M-statistic is      a comparison of two distributions of interpoint distances between locations       RESULTS: When the spread of simulated spatial disturbances was contained to a      small portion of the study region or affects a large proportion of the population      at risk, power was highest when exact locations were reported  If the spatial      disturbance was a more modest signal, the best power was attained at an      aggregated level  CONCLUSIONS: The precision at which patients' locations are      reported has the potential to affect the power of detection significantly

PMID- 19717806   - Time-dependent drug-drug interactions  TDDIs  are drug combinations that result      in a decreased drug effect due to coadministration of a second drug  Such      interactions can be prevented by separately administering the drugs  This study      attempted to reduce drug administration errors due to overridden TDDIs in a care       provider order entry  CPOE  system  In four periods divided over two studies,      logged TDDIs were investigated by reviewing the time intervals prescribed in the       CPOE and recorded on the patient chart  The first study showed significant drug      administration error reduction from 56 4 to 36 2%  p<0 05 , whereas the second      study was not successful  46 7 and 45 2%; p>0 05   Despite interventions, drug      administration errors still occurred in more than one third of cases and      prescribing errors in 79-87%  Probably the low alert specificity, the unclear     alert information content, and the inability of the software to support safe and       efficient TDDI alert handling all diminished correct prescribing, and      consequently, insufficiently reduced drug administration errors

PMID- 19717801   - Computational support of clinical decisions frequently requires the integration      of data in a variety of formats and from multiple sources and domains  Some      impressive multiscale computational models of biological phenomena have been      developed as part of the study of disease and healthcare systems  One can now      contemplate harnessing these models arising from computational biology and using       highly interconnected clinical data to support clinical decision-making  Indeed,       understanding how to build computational systems able to reason across      heterogeneous models and datasets is one of the major and perhaps foundational      challenges of translational biomedical informatics  In this paper, the authors      examine the use of multimodels  models composed of several daughter models  and      explore three major research challenges to reasoning across multiple models:      model selection, model composition, and computer aided model construction

PMID- 19717799   - OBJECTIVE: Clinical informatics intervention research suffers from a lack of      attention to external validity in study design, implementation, evaluation, and      reporting  This hampers the ability of others to assess the fit of a clinical      informatics intervention with demonstrated efficacy in one setting for     implementation in their setting  The objective of this model formulation paper is      to demonstrate the applicability of the RE-AIM  Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,      Implementation, and Maintenance  framework with proposed extensions to clinical      informatics intervention research and describe the framework's role in      facilitating the translation of evidence into practice and generation of evidence      from practice  Both aspects are essential to reap the clinical and public health       benefits of clinical informatics research  DESIGN: We expanded RE-AIM through the      addition of assessment questions relevant to clinical informatics intervention      research including those related to predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing      factors and validated it with two case studies  RESULTS: The first case study      supported the applicability of RE-AIM to inform real world implementation of a      clinical informatics intervention with demonstrated efficacy in randomized      controlled trials  RCTs --the Choice  Creating better Health Outcomes by      Improving Communication about Patients' Experiences  intervention  The second, an      RCT of a personal digital assistant-based decision support system for     guideline-based care, illustrated how RE-AIM can be used to inform the design of       an efficacy RCT that captures essential contextual details typically lacking in      RCT design and reporting  CONCLUSION: The case studies validate, through example,      the applicability of RE-AIM to inform the design, implementation, evaluation, and      reporting of clinical informatics intervention studies

PMID- 19717793   - The substantial growth in mobile handheld technologies has heralded the      opportunity to provide physicians with access to information, resources, and      people at the right time and place  But is this technology delivering the      benefits to workflow and patient care promised by increased mobility? The authors      conducted a systematic review to examine evidence regarding the impact of mobile       handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care,      focusing on quantification of the espoused virtues of mobile technologies  The      authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal      digital assistants  PDAs  to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error       prevention, and data management and accessibility  The use of PDAs demonstrates      the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid      response crucial  However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes      and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the      literature  The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that      asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work      practices and outcomes

PMID- 19567802   - OBJECTIVE: Each Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  concept is assigned one or     more semantic types  ST   A dynamic methodology for aiding an auditor in finding       concepts that are missing the assignment of a given ST, S is presented  DESIGN:      The first part of the methodology exploits the previously introduced Refined      Semantic Network and accompanying refined semantic types  RST  to help narrow the      search space for offending concepts  The auditing is focused in a neighborhood      surrounding the extent of an RST, T  of S  called an envelope, consisting of      parents and children of concepts in the extent  The audit moves outward as long      as missing assignments are discovered  In the second part, concepts not reached      previously are processed and reassigned T as needed during the processing of S's       other RSTs  The set of such concepts is expanded in a similar way to that in the       first part  MEASUREMENTS: The number of errors discovered is reported  To measure      the methodology's efficiency, "error hit rates"  i e , errors found in concepts      examined  are computed  RESULTS: The methodology was applied to three STs:      Experimental Model of Disease  EMD , Environmental Effect of Humans, and      Governmental or Regulatory Activity  The EMD experienced the most drastic change       For its RST "EMD intersection Neoplastic Process"  RST "EMD"  with only 33  31       original concepts, 915  134  concepts were found by the first  second  part to be      missing the EMD assignment  Changes to the other two STs were smaller       CONCLUSION: The results show that the proposed auditing methodology can help to      effectively and efficiently identify concepts lacking the assignment of a      particular semantic type

PMID- 19567801   - OBJECTIVE: To devise an automated approach for integrating federated database      information using database ontologies constructed from their extended metadata       BACKGROUND: One challenge of database federation is that the granularity of      representation of equivalent data varies across systems  Dealing effectively with      this problem is analogous to dealing with precoordinated vs  postcoordinated      concepts in biomedical ontologies  MODEL DESCRIPTION: The authors describe an      approach based on ontological metadata mapping rules defined with elements of a      global vocabulary, which allows a query specified at one granularity level to      fetch data, where possible, from databases within the federation that use      different granularities  This is implemented in OntoMediator, a newly developed      production component of our previously described Query Integrator System       OntoMediator's operation is illustrated with a query that accesses three      geographically separate, interoperating databases  An example based on SNOMED      also illustrates the applicability of high-level rules to support the enforcement      of constraints that can prevent inappropriate curator or power-user actions       SUMMARY: A rule-based framework simplifies the design and maintenance of systems       where categories of data must be mapped to each other, for the purpose of either       cross-database query or for curation of the contents of compositional controlled       vocabularies

PMID- 19567799   - OBJECTIVE: To compare users' speed, number of entry errors and satisfaction in      using two current devices for electronic data collection in clinical research:      handheld and laptop computers  DESIGN: The authors performed a randomized      cross-over trial using 160 different paper-based questionnaires and representing       altogether 45,440 variables  Four data coders were instructed to record,      according to a random predefined and equally balanced sequence, the content of      these questionnaires either on a laptop or on a handheld computer  Instructions      on the kind of device to be used were provided to data-coders in individual      sealed and opaque envelopes  Study conditions were controlled and the data entry       process performed in a quiet environment  MEASUREMENTS: The authors compared the       duration of the data recording process, the number of errors and users'      satisfaction with the two devices  The authors divided errors into two separate      categories, typing and missing data errors  The original paper-based      questionnaire was used as a gold-standard  RESULTS: The overall duration of the      recording process was significantly reduced  2 0 versus 3 3 min  when data were      recorded on the laptop computer  p < 0 001   Data accuracy also improved  There      were 5 8 typing errors per 1,000 entries with the laptop compared to 8 4 per     1,000 with the handheld computer  p < 0 001   The difference was even more      important for missing data which decreased from 22 8 to 2 9 per 1,000 entries      when a laptop was used  p < 0 001   Users found the laptop easier, faster and      more satisfying to use than the handheld computer  CONCLUSIONS: Despite the      increasing use of handheld computers for electronic data collection in clinical      research, these devices should be used with caution  They double the duration of       the data entry process and significantly increase the risk of typing errors and      missing data  This may become a particularly crucial issue in studies where these      devices are provided to patients or healthcare workers, unfamiliar with computer       technologies, for self-reporting or research data collection processes

PMID- 19567798   - Previous reviews have examined evidence of the impact of CPOE on medication      errors, but have used highly variable definitions of "error"  We attempted to      answer a very focused question, namely, what evidence exists that CPOE systems      reduce prescribing errors among hospital inpatients? We identified 13 papers       reporting 12 studies  published between 1998 and 2007  Nine demonstrated a      significant reduction in prescribing error rates for all or some drug types  Few       studies examined changes in error severity, but minor errors were most often      reported as decreasing  Several studies reported increases in the rate of      duplicate orders and failures to discontinue drugs, often attributed to      inappropriate selection from a dropdown menu or to an inability to view all      active medication orders concurrently  The evidence-base reporting the      effectiveness of CPOE to reduce prescribing errors is not compelling and is      limited by modest study sample sizes and designs  Future studies should include      larger samples including multiple sites, controlled study designs, and      standardized error and severity reporting  The role of decision support in      minimizing severe prescribing error rates also requires investigation

PMID- 19567794   - OBJECTIVE: The Internet's potential to bolster health promotion and disease      prevention efforts has attracted considerable attention  Existing research leaves      two things unclear, however: the prevalence of online health and medical      information seeking and the distinguishing characteristics of individuals who      seek that information  DESIGN: This study seeks to clarify and extend the      knowledge base concerning health and medical information use online by profiling       adults using Internet medical information  IMI   Secondary analysis of survey      data from a large sample  n = 6,119  representative of the Atlanta, GA, area      informed this investigation  MEASUREMENTS: Five survey questions were used to      assess IMI use and general computer and Internet use during the 30 days before      the survey was administered  Five questions were also used to assess respondents'      health care system use  Several demographic characteristics were measured       RESULTS Contrary to most prior research, this study found relatively low      prevalence of IMI-seeking behavior  Specifically, IMI use was reported by 13 2%      of all respondents  n = 6,119  and by 21 1% of respondents with Internet access       n = 3,829   Logistic regression models conducted among respondents accessing the      Internet in the previous 30 days revealed that, when controlling for several      sociodemographic characteristics, home computer ownership, online time per week,       and health care system use are all positively linked with IMI-seeking behavior       CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest it may be premature to embrace unilaterally the      Internet as an effective asset for health promotion and disease prevention      efforts that target the public

PMID- 19567793   - OBJECTIVE: Patient portals may improve pediatric chronic disease outcomes, but      few have been rigorously evaluated for usability by parents  Using scenario-based      testing with think-aloud protocols, we evaluated the usability of portals for     parents of children with cystic fibrosis, diabetes or arthritis  DESIGN Sixteen      parents used a prototype and test data to complete 14 tasks followed by a      validated satisfaction questionnaire  Three iterations of the prototype were      used  MEASUREMENTS: During the usability testing, we measured the time it took      participants to complete or give up on each task  Sessions were videotaped and      content-analyzed for common themes  Following testing, participants completed the      Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaire which measured their opinions on      the efficiency of the system, its ease of use, and the likeability of the system       interface  A 7-point Likert scale was used, with seven indicating the highest      possible satisfaction  RESULTS: Mean task completion times ranged from 73  +/-      61  seconds to locate a document to 431  +/- 286  seconds to graph laboratory      results  Tasks such as graphing, location of data, requesting access, and data      interpretation were challenging  Satisfaction was greatest for interface      pleasantness  5 9 +/- 0 7  and likeability  5 8 +/- 0 6  and lowest for error     messages  2 3 +/- 1 2  and clarity of information  4 2 +/- 1 4   Overall mean      satisfaction scores improved between iteration one and three  CONCLUSIONS:      Despite parental involvement and prior heuristic testing, scenario-based testing       demonstrated difficulties in navigation, medical language complexity, error     recovery, and provider-based organizational schema  While such usability testing       can be expensive, the current study demonstrates that it can assist in making      healthcare system interfaces for laypersons more user-friendly and potentially      more functional for patients and their families

PMID- 19567792   - OBJECTIVE: Machine learning systems can be an aid to experts performing      systematic reviews  SRs  by automatically ranking journal articles for     work-prioritization  This work investigates whether a topic-specific automated      document ranking system for SRs can be improved using a hybrid approach,      combining topic-specific training data with data from other SR topics  DESIGN: A       test collection was built using annotated reference files from 24 systematic drug      class reviews  A support vector machine learning algorithm was evaluated with      cross-validation, using seven different fractions of topic-specific training data      in combination with samples from the other 23 topics  This approach was compared       to both a baseline system, which used only topic-specific training data, and to a      system using only the nontopic data sampled from the remaining topics       MEASUREMENTS: Mean area under the receiver-operating curve  AUC  was used as the       measure of comparison  RESULTS: On average, the hybrid system improved mean AUC      over the baseline system by 20%, when topic-specific training data were scarce       The system performed significantly better than the baseline system at all levels       of topic-specific training data  In addition, the system performed better than      the nontopic system at all but the two smallest fractions of topic specific      training data, and no worse than the nontopic system with these smallest amounts       of topic specific training data  CONCLUSIONS: Automated literature prioritization      could be helpful in assisting experts to organize their time when performing      systematic reviews  Future work will focus on extending the algorithm to use      additional sources of topic-specific data, and on embedding the algorithm in an      interactive system available to systematic reviewers during the literature review      process

PMID- 19567790   - OBJECTIVE: Personal health records  PHRs  can increase patient access to health      care information  However, use of PHRs may be unequal by race/ethnicity  DESIGN:       The authors conducted a 2-year cohort study  2005-2007  assessing differences in       rates of registration with KP org, a component of the Kaiser Permanente      electronic health record  EHR   MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, 1,777 25-59 year old      Kaiser Permanente Georgia enrollees, who had not registered with KP org,      responded to a mixed mode  written or Internet  survey  Baseline, EHR, and KP org      data were linked  Time to KP org registration by race from 10/1/05  with      censoring for disenrollment from Kaiser Permanente  was adjusted for baseline      education, comorbidity, patient activation, and completion of the baseline survey      online vs  by paper using Cox proportional hazards  RESULTS: Of 1,777, 34 7%       616  registered with KP org between Oct 2005 and Nov 2007  Median time to      registering a KP org account was 409 days  Among African Americans, 30 1%      registered, compared with 41 7% of whites  p < 0 01   In the hazards model,      African Americans were again less likely to register than whites  hazard ratio      [HR] = 0 652, 95% CI: 0 549-0 776  despite adjustment  Those with baseline      Internet access were more likely to register  HR = 1 629, 95% CI: 1 294-2 050 ,      and a significant educational gradient was also observed  more likely      registration with higher educational levels   CONCLUSIONS: Differences in      education, income, and Internet access did not account for the disparities in PHR     registration by race  In the short-term, attempts to improve patient access to      health care with PHRs may not ameliorate prevailing disparities between African      Americans and whites

PMID- 19567789   - OBJECTIVE: To incorporate value-based weight scaling into the Fellegi-Sunter      F-S  maximum likelihood linkage algorithm and evaluate the performance of the      modified algorithm  Background Because healthcare data are fragmented across many      healthcare systems, record linkage is a key component of fully functional health       information exchanges  Probabilistic linkage methods produce more accurate,      dynamic, and robust matching results than rule-based approaches, particularly      when matching patient records that lack unique identifiers  Theoretically, the      relative frequency of specific data elements can enhance the F-S method,      including minimizing the false-positive or false-negative matches  However, to      our knowledge, no frequency-based weight scaling modification to the F-S method      has been implemented and specifically evaluated using real-world clinical data       METHODS: The authors implemented a value-based weight scaling modification using       an information theoretical model, and formally evaluated the effectiveness of      this modification by linking 51,361 records from Indiana statewide newborn      screening data to 80,089 HL7 registration messages from the Indiana Network for     Patient Care, an operational health information exchange  In addition to applying      the weight scaling modification to all fields, we examined the effect of      selectively scaling common or uncommon field-specific values  RESULTS: The      sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for applying weight      scaling to all field-specific values were 95 4, 98 8, and 99 9%, respectively       Compared with nonweight scaling, the modified F-S algorithm demonstrated a 10%      increase in specificity with a 3% decrease in sensitivity  CONCLUSION: By      eliminating false-positive matches, the value-based weight modification can      enhance the specificity of the F-S method with minimal decrease in sensitivity

PMID- 19390113   - Previous studies have shown the importance of workflow issues in the      implementation of CPOE systems and patient safety practices  To understand the      impact of CPOE on clinical workflow, we developed a conceptual framework and      conducted a literature search for CPOE evaluations between 1990 and June 2007       Fifty-one publications were identified that disclosed mixed effects of CPOE      systems  Among the frequently reported workflow advantages were the legible      orders, remote accessibility of the systems, and the shorter order turnaround      times  Among the frequently reported disadvantages were the time-consuming and      problematic user-system interactions, and the enforcement of a predefined      relationship between clinical tasks and between providers  Regarding the      diversity of findings in the literature, we conclude that more multi-method      research is needed to explore CPOE's multidimensional and collective impact on      especially collaborative workflow

PMID- 19390112   - A systematic literature review was performed to identify variables promoting      consumer health information technology  CHIT  acceptance among patients  The      electronic bibliographic databases Web of Science, Business Source Elite, CINAHL,      Communication and Mass Media Complete, MEDLINE, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo were      searched  A cited reference search of articles meeting the inclusion criteria was      also conducted to reduce misses  Fifty-two articles met the selection criteria       Among them, 94 different variables were tested for associations with acceptance        Most of those tested  71%  were patient factors, including sociodemographic      characteristics, health- and treatment-related variables, and prior experience or     exposure to computer/health technology  Only ten variables were related to      human-technology interaction; 16 were organizational factors; and one was related      to the environment  In total, 62  66%  were found to predict acceptance in at      least one study  Existing literature focused largely on patient-related factors        No studies examined the impact of social and task factors on acceptance, and few       tested the effects of organizational or environmental factors on acceptance       Future research guided by technology acceptance theories should fill those gaps      to improve our understanding of patient CHIT acceptance, which in turn could lead      to better CHIT design and implementation

PMID- 19390108   - OBJECTIVE The authors previously implemented an electronic heart failure registry      at a large academic hospital to identify heart failure patients and to connect      these patients with appropriate discharge services  Despite significant      improvements in patient identification and connection rates, time to connection      remained high, with an average delay of 3 2 days from the time patients were      admitted to the time connections were made  Our objective for this current study       was to determine the most effective solution to minimize time to connection       DESIGN We used a queuing theory model to simulate 3 different potential solutions      to decrease the delay from patient identification to connection with discharge      services  MEASUREMENTS The measures included average rate at which patients were       being connected to the post discharge heart failure services program, average      number of patients in line, and average patient waiting time  RESULTS Using      queuing theory model simulations, we were able to estimate for our current system      the minimum rate at which patients need to be connected  262 patients/mo , the      ideal patient arrival rate  174 patients/mo  and the maximal patient arrival rate      that could be achieved by adding 1 extra nurse  348 patients/mo   CONCLUSIONS Our     modeling approach was instrumental in helping us characterize key process      parameters and estimate the impact of adding staff on the time between      identifying patients with heart failure and connecting them with appropriate      discharge services

PMID- 19390106   - OBJECTIVE To compare the experiences of e-prescribing users and nonusers      regarding prescription safety and workload and to assess the use of information      from two e-prescribing standards  for medication history and formulary and      benefit information , as they are implemented  DESIGN Cross-sectional survey of      physicians who either had installed or were awaiting installation of one of two      commercial e-prescribing systems  MEASUREMENTS Perceptions about medication      history and formulary and benefit information among all respondents, and among      e-prescribing users, experiences with system usability, job performance impact,      and amount of e-prescribing  RESULTS Of 395 eligible physicians, 228  58%       completed the survey  E-prescribers  n = 139  were more likely than      non-e-prescribers  n = 89  to perceive that they could identify clinically      important drug-drug interactions  83 versus 67%, p = 0 004  but not that they      could identify prescriptions from other providers  65 versus 60%, p = 0 49   They      also perceived no significant difference in calls about drug coverage problems       76 versus 71% reported getting 10 or fewer such calls per week; p = 0 43   Most       e-prescribers reported high satisfaction with their systems, but 17% had stopped       using the system and another 46% said they sometimes reverted to handwriting for       prescriptions that they could write electronically  The volume of e-prescribing      was correlated with perceptions that it enhanced job performance, whereas      quitting was associated with perceptions of poor usability  CONCLUSIONS      E-prescribing users reported patient safety benefits but they did not perceive      the enhanced benefits expected from using standardized medication history or     formulary and benefit information  Additional work is needed for these standards       to have the desired effects

PMID- 19390104   - OBJECTIVE Electronic health records  EHRs  have potential to improve quality and       safety, but many physicians do not use these systems to full capacity  The      objective of this study was to determine whether this usage gap is narrowing over     time  DESIGN Follow-up mail survey of 1,144 physicians in Massachusetts who      completed a 2005 survey  MEASUREMENTS Adoption of EHRs and availability and use      of 10 EHR functions  RESULTS The response rate was 79 4%  In 2007, 35% of      practices had EHRs, up from 23% in 2005  Among practices with EHRs, there was      little change between 2005 and 2007 in the availability of nine of ten EHR     features; the notable exception was electronic prescribing, reported as available      in 44 7% of practices with EHRs in 2005 and 70 8% in 2007  Use of EHR functions      changed inconsequentially, with more than one out of five physicians not using      each available function regularly in both 2005 and 2007  Only electronic      prescribing increased substantially: in 2005, 19 9% of physicians with this      function available used it most or all the time, compared with 42 6% in 2007  p <      0 001   CONCLUSIONS By 2007, more than one third of practices in Massachusetts      reported having EHRs; the availability and use of electronic prescribing within      these systems has increased  In contrast, physicians reported little change in      the availability and use of other EHR functions  System refinements,      certification efforts, and health policies, including standards development,      should address the gaps in both EHR adoption and the use of key functions

PMID- 19390103   - The Obesity Challenge, sponsored by Informatics for Integrating Biology and the      Bedside  i2b2 , a National Center for Biomedical Computing, asked participants to      build software systems that could "read" a patient's clinical discharge summary      and replicate the judgments of physicians in evaluating presence or absence of      obesity and 15 comorbidities  The authors describe their methodology and discuss       the results of applying Lockheed Martin's rule-based natural language processing        NLP  capability, ClinREAD  We tailored ClinREAD with medical domain expertise to      create assigned default judgments based on the most probable results as defined      in the ground truth  It then used rules to collect evidence similar to the      evidence that the human judges likely relied upon, and applied a logic module to       weigh the strength of all evidence collected to arrive at final judgments  The      Challenge results suggest that rule-based systems guided by human medical      expertise are capable of solving complex problems in machine processing of      medical text

PMID- 19390102   - OBJECTIVE Evaluate the effectiveness of a simple rule-based approach in      classifying medical discharge summaries according to indicators for obesity and      15 associated co-morbidities as part of the 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge  METHODS       The authors applied a rule-based approach that looked for occurrences of      morbidity-related keywords and identified the types of assertions in which those       keywords occurred  The documents were then classified using a simple scoring      algorithm based on a mapping of the assertion types to possible judgment      categories  MEASUREMENTS RESULTS for the challenge were evaluated based on macro       F-measure  We report micro and macro F-measure results for all morbidities      combined and for each morbidity separately  Results Our rule-based approach      achieved micro and macro F-measures of 0 97 and 0 77, respectively, ranking fifth      out of the entries submitted by 28 teams participating in the classification task      based on textual judgments and substantially outperforming the average for the      challenge  CONCLUSIONS As shown by its ranking in the challenge results, this      approach performed relatively well under conditions in which limited training      data existed for some judgment categories  Further, the approach held up well in       relation to more complex approaches applied to this classification task  The      approach could be enhanced by the addition of expert rules to model more complex       medical reasoning

PMID- 19390101   - OBJECTIVE Automated and disease-specific classification of textual clinical      discharge summaries is of great importance in human life science, as it helps      physicians to make medical studies by providing statistically relevant data for     analysis  This can be further facilitated if, at the labeling of discharge      summaries, semantic labels are also extracted from text, such as whether a given       disease is present, absent, questionable in a patient, or is unmentioned in the      document  The authors present a classification technique that successfully solves      the semantic classification task  DESIGN The authors introduce a context-aware      rule-based semantic classification technique for use on clinical discharge      summaries  The classification is performed in subsequent steps  First, some      misleading parts are removed from the text; then the text is partitioned into      positive, negative, and uncertain context segments, then a sequence of binary      classifiers is applied to assign the appropriate semantic labels  Measurement For     evaluation the authors used the documents of the i2b2 Obesity Challenge and      adopted its evaluation measures: F 1 -macro and F 1 -micro for measurements       RESULTS On the two subtasks of the Obesity Challenge  textual and intuitive      classification  the system performed very well, and achieved a F 1 -macro = 0 80       for the textual and F 1 -macro = 0 67 for the intuitive tasks, and obtained      second place at the textual and first place at the intuitive subtasks of the      challenge  CONCLUSIONS The authors show in the paper that a simple rule-based      classifier can tackle the semantic classification task more successfully than      machine learning techniques, if the training data are limited and some semantic      labels are very sparse

PMID- 19390098   - OBJECTIVE The authors present a system developed for the Challenge in Natural      Language Processing for Clinical Data-the i2b2 obesity challenge, whose aim was      to automatically identify the status of obesity and 15 related co-morbidities in       patients using their clinical discharge summaries  The challenge consisted of two      tasks, textual and intuitive  The textual task was to identify explicit      references to the diseases, whereas the intuitive task focused on the prediction       of the disease status when the evidence was not explicitly asserted  DESIGN The      authors assembled a set of resources to lexically and semantically profile the      diseases and their associated symptoms, treatments, etc  These features were      explored in a hybrid text mining approach, which combined dictionary look-up,      rule-based, and machine-learning methods  MEASUREMENTS The methods were applied      on a set of 507 previously unseen discharge summaries, and the predictions were      evaluated against a manually prepared gold standard  The overall ranking of the      participating teams was primarily based on the macro-averaged F-measure  RESULTS       The implemented method achieved the macro-averaged F-measure of 81% for the      textual task  which was the highest achieved in the challenge  and 63% for the      intuitive task  ranked 7 th  out of 28 teams-the highest was 66%   The      micro-averaged F-measure showed an average accuracy of 97% for textual and 96%      for intuitive annotations  CONCLUSIONS The performance achieved was in line with       the agreement between human annotators, indicating the potential of text mining      for accurate and efficient prediction of disease statuses from clinical discharge      summaries

PMID- 19390097   - OBJECTIVE In this study the authors describe the system submitted by the team of       University of Szeged to the second i2b2 Challenge in Natural Language Processing       for Clinical Data  The challenge focused on the development of automatic systems       that analyzed clinical discharge summary texts and addressed the following      question: "Who's obese and what co-morbidities do they  definitely/most likely       have?"  Target diseases included obesity and its 15 most frequent comorbidities      exhibited by patients, while the target labels corresponded to expert judgments      based on textual evidence and intuition  separately   DESIGN The authors applied       statistical methods to preselect the most common and confident terms and      evaluated outlier documents by hand to discover infrequent spelling variants  The      authors expected a system with dictionaries gathered semi-automatically to have a      good performance with moderate development costs  the authors examined just a      small proportion of the records manually   MEASUREMENTS Following the standard      evaluation method of the second Workshop on challenges in Natural Language      Processing for Clinical Data, the authors used both macro- and microaveraged      Fbeta=1 measure for evaluation  RESULTS The authors submission achieved a      microaverage F beta=1  score of 97 29% for classification based on textual      evidence  macroaverage F beta=1  = 76 22%  and 96 42% for intuitive judgments       macroaverage F beta=1  = 67 27%   CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate the      feasibility of the authors approach and show that even very simple systems with a      shallow linguistic analysis can achieve remarkable accuracy scores for     classifying clinical records on a limited set of concepts

PMID- 19390096   - In order to survey, facilitate, and evaluate studies of medical language      processing on clinical narratives, i2b2  Informatics for Integrating Biology to      the Bedside  organized its second challenge and workshop  This challenge focused       on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common      comorbidities from patient discharge summaries  For each patient, obesity and any      of the comorbidities could be Present, Absent, or Questionable  i e , possible       in the patient, or Unmentioned in the discharge summary of the patient  i2b2      provided data for, and invited the development of, automated systems that can      classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on      individual discharge summaries  This article refers to obesity and comorbidities       as diseases  It refers to the categories Present, Absent, Questionable, and      Unmentioned as classes  The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is       called the Obesity Challenge  The data released by i2b2 was annotated for textual      judgments reflecting the explicitly reported information on diseases, and      intuitive judgments reflecting medical professionals' reading of the information       presented in discharge summaries  There were very few examples of some disease      classes in the data  The Obesity Challenge paid particular attention to the      performance of systems on these less well-represented classes  A total of 30      teams participated in the Obesity Challenge  Each team was allowed to submit two       sets of up to three system runs for evaluation, resulting in a total of 136      submissions  The submissions represented a combination of rule-based and machine       learning approaches  Evaluation of system runs shows that the best predictions of      textual judgments come from systems that filter the potentially noisy portions of      the narratives, project dictionaries of disease names onto the remaining text,      apply negation extraction, and process the text through rules  Information on      disease-related concepts, such as symptoms and medications, and general medical      knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the diseases

PMID- 19390094   - OBJECTIVE Electronic health records  EHRs  have the potential to advance the      quality of care, but studies have shown mixed results  The authors sought to      examine the extent of EHR usage and how the quality of care delivered in      ambulatory care practices varied according to duration of EHR availability       METHODS The study linked two data sources: a statewide survey of physicians'      adoption and use of EHR and claims data reflecting quality of care as indicated      by physicians' performance on widely used quality measures  Using four years of      measurement, we combined 18 quality measures into 6 clinical condition      categories  While the survey of physicians was cross-sectional, respondents      indicated the year in which they adopted EHR  In an analysis accounting for     duration of EHR use, we examined the relationship between EHR adoption and      quality of care  RESULTS The percent of physicians reporting adoption of EHR and       availability of EHR core functions more than doubled between 2000 and 2005  Among      EHR users in 2005, the average duration of EHR use was 4 8 years  For all 6      clinical conditions, there was no difference in performance between EHR users and      non-users  In addition, for these 6 clinical conditions, there was no consistent       pattern between length of time using an EHR and physicians performance on quality      measures in both bivariate and multivariate analyses  CONCLUSIONS In this      cross-sectional study, we found no association between duration of using an EHR     and performance with respect to quality of care, although power was limited       Intensifying the use of key EHR features, such as clinical decision support, may       be needed to realize quality improvement from EHRs  Future studies should examine      the relationship between the extent to which physicians use key EHR functions and      their performance on quality measures over time

PMID- 19261950   - Electronic laboratory interfaces can significantly increase the value of      ambulatory electronic health record  EHR  systems by providing laboratory result       data automatically and in a computable form  However, many ambulatory EHRs cannot      implement electronic laboratory interfaces despite the existence of messaging      standards, such as Health Level 7, version 2  HL7   Among several barriers to      implementing laboratory interfaces is the extensive optionality within the HL7      message standard  This paper describes the rationale for and development of an      HL7 implementation guide that seeks to eliminate most of the optionality inherent      in HL7, but retain the information content required for reporting outpatient      laboratory results  A work group of heterogeneous stakeholders developed the      implementation guide based on a set of design principles that emphasized      parsimony, practical requirements, and near-term adoption  The resulting      implementation guide contains 93% fewer optional data elements than HL7  This      guide was successfully implemented by 15 organizations during an initial testing       phase and has been approved by the HL7 standards body as an implementation guide       for outpatient laboratory reporting  Further testing is required to determine      whether widespread adoption of the implementation guide by laboratories and EHR     systems can facilitate the implementation of electronic laboratory interfaces

PMID- 19261949   - Errors associated with medication documentation account for a substantial      fraction of preventable medical errors  Hence, the Joint Commission has called      for the adoption of reconciliation strategies at all United States healthcare      institutions  Although studies suggest that reconciliation tools can reduce      errors, it remains unclear how best to implement systems and processes that are      reliable and sensitive to clinical workflow  The authors designed a primary care       process that supported reconciliation without compromising clinic efficiency       This manuscript describes the design and implementation of Automated Patient      History Intake Device  APHID : ambulatory check-in kiosks that allow patients to       review the names, dosage, frequency, and pictures of their medications before      their appointment  Medication lists are retrieved from the electronic health      record and patient updates are captured and reviewed by providers during the      clinic session  Results from the roll-in phase indicate the device is easy for     patients to use and integrates well with clinic workflow

PMID- 19261947   - OBJECTIVE To compare information obtained from narrative and structured      electronic sources using anti-hypertensive medication intensification as an      example clinical issue of interest  DESIGN A retrospective cohort study of 5,634       hypertensive patients with diabetes from 2000 to 2005  MEASUREMENTS The authors      determined the fraction of medication intensification events documented in both      narrative and structured data in the electronic medical record  The authors      analyzed the relationship between provider characteristics and concordance      between intensifications in narrative and structured data  As there is no gold      standard data source for medication information, the authors clinically validated      medication intensification information by assessing the relationship between      documented medication intensification and the patients' blood pressure in      univariate and multivariate models  RESULTS Overall, 5,627  30 9%  of 18,185      medication intensification events were documented in both sources  For a      medication intensification event documented in narrative notes the probability of      a concordant entry in structured records increased by 11% for each study year  p       < 0 0001  and decreased by 19% for each decade of provider age  p = 0 035   In a       multivariate model that adjusted for patient demographics and intraphysician      correlations, an increase of one medication intensification per month documented       in either narrative or structured data were associated with a 5-8 mm Hg monthly      decrease in systolic and 1 5-4 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure  p <      0 0001 for all   CONCLUSION Narrative and structured electronic data sources      provide complementary information on anti-hypertensive medication      intensification  Clinical validity of information in both sources was      demonstrated by correlation with changes in blood pressure

PMID- 19261941   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of electronic health record data for     syndromic surveillance and to assess the feasibility of broadly distributed      surveillance  DESIGN: Two systems were developed to identify influenza-like      illness and gastrointestinal infectious disease in ambulatory electronic health      record data from a network of community health centers  The first system used      queries on structured data and was designed for this specific electronic health      record  The second used natural language processing of narrative data, but its      queries were developed independently from this health record  Both were compared       to influenza isolates and to a verified emergency department chief complaint      surveillance system  MEASUREMENTS: Lagged cross-correlation and graphs of the      three time series  RESULTS: For influenza-like illness, both the structured and      narrative data correlated well with the influenza isolates and with the emergency      department data, achieving cross-correlations of 0 89  structured  and 0 84       narrative  for isolates and 0 93 and 0 89 for emergency department data, and      having similar peaks during influenza season  For gastrointestinal infectious      disease, the structured data correlated fairly well with the emergency department      data  0 81  with a similar peak, but the narrative data correlated less well       0 47   CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use electronic health records for     syndromic surveillance  The structured data performed best but required knowledge      engineering to match the health record data to the queries  The narrative data      illustrated the potential performance of a broadly disseminated system and      achieved mixed results

PMID- 19261940   - OBJECTIVE: To use the semantic and structural properties in the Unified Medical      Language System  UMLS  Metathesaurus to characterize and discover potential      relationships  DESIGN: The UMLS integrates knowledge from several biomedical      terminologies  This knowledge can be used to discover implicit semantic      relationships between concepts  In this paper, the authors propose a      problem-independent approach for discovering potential terminological      relationships that employs semantic abstraction of indirect relationship paths to      perform classification and analysis of network theoretical measures such as      topological overlap, preferential attachment, graph partitioning, and number of      indirect paths  Using different versions of the UMLS, the authors evaluate the      proposed approach's ability to predict newly added relationships  MEASUREMENTS:      Classification accuracy, precision-recall  RESULTS: Strong discriminative      characteristics were observed with a semantic abstraction based classifier      classification accuracy of 91% , the average number of indirect paths,      preferential attachment, and graph partitioning to identify potential      relationships  The proposed relationship prediction algorithm resulted in 56%      recall in top 10 results for new relationships added to subsequent versions of      the UMLS between 2005 and 2007  CONCLUSIONS: The UMLS has sufficient knowledge to      enable discovery of potential terminological relationships

PMID- 19261939   - OBJECTIVE: To identify some of the challenges that medical residents face in      addressing their information needs in an inpatient setting, by examining how      voice capture in natural language of clinical questions fits into workflow, and      by characterizing the focus, format, and semantic content and complexity of their     questions  DESIGN: Internal medicine residents captured information needs on a      digital recorder while on a hospital inpatient service and then participated in      semi-structured interviews  MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were analyzed to identify      emergent themes  Recorded questions were analyzed for focus  diagnosis,      treatment, or epidemiology  and format, either foreground  specific knowledge      relating to an individual patient  or background  general knowledge about a      condition   Semantic concepts and types were identified using MetaMap  UMLS -      Unified Medical Language System  and manually  RESULTS: Voice recording of      questions appeared to unmask residents' latent information needs  Although      residents were able to record questions during workflow, there was a delay from      the time questions materialized to when they were recorded  Question focus was      distributed among diagnosis  32% , treatment  40% , and epidemiology  28% , and      the majority of questions were background  69%   Questions were semantically      complex; foreground and background questions averaged 12 6  SD 6 0  and 9 1  SD      6 0  UMLS concepts, respectively  MetaMap failed to recognize concepts when      residents used acronyms or abbreviations or omitted key terms  CONCLUSIONS: We      found that it is feasible for residents to capture their clinical questions in      natural language during workflow and that recording questions may prompt      awareness of previously unrecognized information needs  However, the semantic      complexity of typical questions and mapping failures due to residents' use of      acronyms and abbreviations present challenges to machine-based extraction of      semantic content

PMID- 19261936   - The Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care  C-HOBIC  project      introduced systematic use of standardized clinical nursing terminology for     patient assessments  Implemented so far in three Canadian provinces, C-HOBIC      comprises an innovative model for large-scale capture of standardized      nursing-sensitive clinical outcomes data within electronic health records  EHRs        To support this activity, nursing assessment and outcomes concepts were mapped to      the International Classification for Nursing Practice  ICNP R    By comparing      serial data on a patient across multiple time points, the C-HOBIC model can      generate nursing-sensitive patient outcome reports  A principle benefit of the      C-HOBIC model is that it provides nurses with information critical to planning      for and evaluating patient care  Inclusion of nursing information in either     provincial databases or EHRs in three Canadian provinces promotes continuity of      patient care across sectors of the healthcare systems in those provinces and also      facilitates aggregation and analysis by administrators and policy makers  The      C-HOBIC model provides standardized, consistent, interoperable clinical      information that reflects nursing practice throughout the Canadian healthcare      System

PMID- 19261935   - With the United States joining other countries in national efforts to reap the      many benefits that use of health information technology can bring for health care      quality and savings, sobering reports recall the complexity and difficulties of      implementing even smaller-scale systems  Despite best practice research that      identified success factors for health information technology projects, a      majority, in some sense, still fail  Similar problems plague a variety of      different kinds of applications, and have done so for many years  Ten AMIA      working groups sponsored a workshop at the AMIA Fall 2006 Symposium  It was      entitled "Avoiding The F-Word: IT Project Morbidity, Mortality, and Immortality"       and focused on this under-addressed problem  PARTICIPANTS discussed      communication, workflow, and quality; the complexity of information technology      undertakings; the need to integrate all aspects of projects, work environments,      and regulatory and policy requirements; and the difficulty of getting all the      parts and participants in harmony  While recognizing that there still are      technical issues related to functionality and interoperability, discussion      affirmed the emerging consensus that problems are due to sociological, cultural,       and financial issues, and hence are more managerial than technical  Participants       drew on lessons from experience and research in identifying important issues,      action items, and recommendations to address the following: what "success" and      "failure" mean, what contributes to making successful or unsuccessful systems,      how to use failure as an enhanced learning opportunity for continued improvement,      how system successes or failures should be studied, and what AMIA should do to      enhance opportunities for successes  The workshop laid out a research agenda and       recommended action items, reflecting the conviction that AMIA members and AMIA as      an organization can take a leadership role to make projects more practical and      likely to succeed in health care settings

PMID- 19261933   - Many biomedical terminologies, classifications, and ontological resources such as      the NCI Thesaurus  NCIT , International Classification of Diseases  ICD ,      Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine  SNOMED , Current Procedural Terminology       CPT , and Gene Ontology  GO  have been developed and used to build a variety of       IT applications in biology, biomedicine, and health care settings  However,      virtually all these resources involve incompatible formats, are based on      different modeling languages, and lack appropriate tooling and programming      interfaces  APIs  that hinder their wide-scale adoption and usage in a variety of      application contexts  The Lexical Grid  LexGrid  project introduced in this paper     is an ongoing community-driven initiative, coordinated by the Mayo Clinic      Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, designed to bridge this gap      using a common terminology model called the LexGrid model  The key aspect of the       model is to accommodate multiple vocabulary and ontology distribution formats and      support of multiple data stores for federated vocabulary distribution  The model       provides a foundation for building consistent and standardized APIs to access      multiple vocabularies that support lexical search queries, hierarchy navigation,       and a rich set of features such as recursive subsumption  e g , get all the      children of the concept penicillin   Existing LexGrid implementations include the      LexBIG API as well as a reference implementation of the HL7 Common Terminology      Services  CTS  specification providing programmatic access via Java, Web, and      Grid services

PMID- 19261932   - OBJECTIVE It is vital to detect the full safety profile of a drug throughout its       market life  Current pharmacovigilance systems still have substantial      limitations, however  The objective of our work is to demonstrate the feasibility      of using natural language processing  NLP , the comprehensive Electronic Health      Record  EHR , and association statistics for pharmacovigilance purposes  DESIGN      Narrative discharge summaries were collected from the Clinical Information System      at New York Presbyterian Hospital  NYPH   MedLEE, an NLP system, was applied to      the collection to identify medication events and entities which could be      potential adverse drug events  ADEs   Co-occurrence statistics with adjusted      volume tests were used to detect associations between the two types of entities,       to calculate the strengths of the associations, and to determine their cutoff      thresholds  Seven drugs/drug classes  ibuprofen, morphine, warfarin, bupropion,      paroxetine, rosiglitazone, ACE inhibitors  with known ADEs were selected to      evaluate the system  RESULTS One hundred thirty-two potential ADEs were found to       be associated with the 7 drugs  Overall recall and precision were 0 75 and 0 31      for known ADEs respectively  Importantly, qualitative evaluation using historic      roll back design suggested that novel ADEs could be detected using our system       CONCLUSIONS This study provides a framework for the development of active,      high-throughput and prospective systems which could potentially unveil drug      safety profiles throughout their entire market life  Our results demonstrate that      the framework is feasible although there are some challenging issues  To the best      of our knowledge, this is the first study using comprehensive unstructured data      from the EHR for pharmacovigilance

PMID- 19261931   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to reassess the projected rate of      Electronic Health Record  EHR  diffusion and examine how the federal government's      efforts to promote the use of EHR technology have influenced physicians'      willingness to adopt such systems  The study recreates and extends the analyses      conducted by Ford et al   1  The two periods examined come before and after the      U S  Federal Government's concerted activity to promote EHR adoption  DESIGN:      Meta-analysis and bass modeling are used to compare EHR diffusion rates for two      distinct periods of government activity  Very low levels of government activity      to promote EHR diffusion marked the first period, before 2004  In 2004, the      President of the United States called for a "Universal EHR Adoption" by 2014  10       yrs , creating the major wave of activity and increased awareness of how EHRs      will impact physicians' practices  MEASUREMENT: EHR adoption parameters--external      and internal coefficients of influence--are estimated using bass diffusion models      and future adoption rates are projected  RESULTS: Comparing the EHR adoption      rates before and after 2004  2001-2004 and 2001-2007 respectively  indicate the      physicians' resistance to adoption has increased during the second period  Based       on current levels of adoption, less than half the physicians working in small      practices will have implemented an EHR by 2014  47 3%   CONCLUSIONS: The external      forces driving EHR diffusion have grown in importance since 2004 relative to      physicians' internal motivation to adopt such systems  Several national forces      are likely contributing to the slowing pace of EHR diffusion

PMID- 19074305   - OBJECTIVES: Medication errors constitute a major problem in all hospitals       Between 20% and 46% of prescriptions requiring dosage adjustments based on renal       function are inappropriate  This study aimed to determine whether implementing      alerts at the time of ordering medication integrated into the computerized      physician order entry decreases the proportion of inappropriate prescriptions      based on the renal function of inpatients  DESIGN: Six alternating 2-month      control and intervention periods were conducted between August 2006 and August      2007 in two medical departments of a teaching hospital in France  A total of 603       patients and 38 physicians were included  During the intervention periods, alerts      were triggered if a patient with renal impairment was prescribed one of the 24      targeted drugs that required adjustment according to estimated glomerular     filtration rate  eGFR   MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome measure was the proportion      of inappropriate first prescriptions, according to recommendation  RESULTS: A      total of 1,122 alerts were triggered  The rate of inappropriate first      prescriptions did not differ significantly between intervention and control      periods  19 9% vs  21 3%; p=0 63   The effect of intervention differed      significantly between residents and senior physicians  p=0 03   Residents tended       to make fewer errors in intervention versus control periods  Odds ratio 0 69; 95%      confidence interval 0 41 to 1 15 , whereas senior physicians tended to make more       inappropriate prescriptions in intervention periods  odds ratio 1 88; 95%      confidence interval 0 91 to 3 89   CONCLUSION: Alert activation was not followed       by a significant decrease in inappropriate prescriptions in our study  Thus, it      is still necessary to evaluate the impact of these systems if newly implemented      in other settings thanks to studies also designed to watch for possible      unanticipated effects of decision supports and their underlying causes

PMID- 19074304   - Health care information technology can be a means to improve quality and      efficiency in the primary care setting  However, merely applying technology      without addressing how it fits into provider workflow and existing systems is      unlikely to achieve improvement goals  Improving quality of primary care, such as      cancer screening rates, requires addressing barriers at system, provider, and      patient levels  The authors report the development, implementation, and      preliminary use of a new breast cancer screening outreach program in a large      multicenter primary care network  This installation paired population-based      surveillance with customized information delivery based on a validated model      linking patients to providers and practices  In the first six months, 86% of      physicians and all case managers voluntarily participated in the program       Providers intervened in 83% of the mammogram-overdue population by initiating      mailed reminders or deferring contact  Overall, 63% of patients were successfully      contacted  Systematic population-based efforts are promising tools to improve      preventative care

PMID- 19074303   - The authors implemented what is possibly the first secure messaging system in a      VA Medical Center  Since reimbursement for secure messaging is not of great      concern and clinical data systems are fully computerized, several evaluation      strategies were used to assess clinical adoption  To address known concerns of      clinicians, the authors analyzed secure messaging use and performed a content      analysis  Message volumes were low and content analysis demonstrated that      messages were appropriate  Despite this, a clinician survey showed that clinical       adoption was impeded by several factors including the introduction of secure      messaging to selected patients, workload concerns, and clinician communication      preferences  In addition, the authors believe that clinicians experienced      clinical adoption inertia resulting from the overload of information in a highly       computerized clinical environment  The authors learned that to promote clinician       adoption they must demonstrate workload benefits from secure messaging and more      fully analyze the clinical computing workload that clinicians experience

PMID- 19074301   - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate user interactions with an electronic      health records  EHR  system by uncovering hidden navigational patterns in the EHR     usage data automatically recorded as clinicians navigated through the system's      software user interface  UI  to perform different clinical tasks  DESIGN: A      homegrown EHR was adapted to allow real-time capture of comprehensive UI      interaction events  These events, constituting time-stamped event sequences, were      used to replay how the EHR was used in actual patient care settings  The study      site is an ambulatory primary care clinic at an urban teaching hospital  Internal      medicine residents were the primary EHR users  MEASUREMENTS: Computer-recorded      event sequences reflecting the order in which different EHR features were      sequentially accessed  METHODS: We apply sequential pattern analysis  SPA  and a       first-order Markov chain model to uncover recurring UI navigational patterns       RESULTS: Of 17 main EHR features provided in the system, SPA identified 3 bundled      features: "Assessment and Plan" and "Diagnosis," "Order" and "Medication," and      "Order" and "Laboratory Test " Clinicians often accessed these paired features in      a bundle together in a continuous sequence  The Markov chain analysis revealed a       global navigational pathway, suggesting an overall sequential order of EHR     feature accesses  "History of Present Illness" followed by "Social History" and      then "Assessment and Plan" was identified as an example of such global      navigational pathways commonly traversed by the EHR users  CONCLUSION: Users      showed consistent UI navigational patterns, some of which were not anticipated by      system designers or the clinic management  Awareness of such unanticipated      patterns may help identify undesirable user behavior as well as reengineering      opportunities for improving the system's usability

PMID- 19074300   - While our Y2K worries about old computers "retiring" at midnight captured the      television and news media attention, a more significant "old age" phenomenon      snuck onto the scene with hardly a headline: the dawn of the age of the aged   1       The over burdened health care system will face a worldwide wave of retirees who      will live longer, cost more to treat, and demand new goods and services to help      them stay healthy, active, and independent  Research in persuasive technologies      and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application      intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a      predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living,      reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more      independent life  This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of      persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or     practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel       research field  It also provides categories of domains within health care in      which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published      literature  The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing       the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use      persuasive technologies in health care

PMID- 19074299   - OBJECTIVE: In public health and health services research, the inclusion of      geographic information in data sets is critical  Because of concerns over the      re-identification of patients, data from small geographic areas are either     suppressed or the geographic areas are aggregated into larger ones  Our objective      is to estimate the population size cut-off at which a geographic area is      sufficiently large so that no data suppression or further aggregation is      necessary  DESIGN: The 2001 Canadian census data were used to conduct a      simulation to model the relationship between geographic area population size and       uniqueness for some common demographic variables  Cut-offs were computed for     geographic area population size, and prediction models were developed to estimate      the appropriate cut-offs  MEASUREMENTS: Re-identification risk was measured using      uniqueness  Geographic area population size cut-offs were estimated using the      maximum number of possible values in the data set and a traditional entropy      measure  RESULTS: The model that predicted population cut-offs using the maximum       number of possible values in the data set had R2 values around 0 9, and relative       error of prediction less than 0 02 across all regions of Canada  The models were       then applied to assess the appropriate geographic area size for the prescription       records provided by retail and hospital pharmacies to commercial research and      analysis firms  CONCLUSIONS: To manage re-identification risk, the prediction      models can be used by public health professionals, health researchers, and      research ethics boards to decide when the geographic area population size is      sufficiently large

PMID- 19074298   - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of the      International Classification of Nursing Practice  1   ICPN  Version 1 0 as a      representational model for nursing assessment documentation  DESIGN AND      MEASUREMENTS: To identify representational requirements of nursing assessments,      the authors mapped key concepts and semantic relations extracted from      standardized and local nursing admission assessment documentation forms/templates      and inpatient admission assessment records to the ICNP  Next, they expanded the      list of ICNP semantic relations with those obtained from the admission assessment      forms/templates  The expanded ICNP semantic relations were then validated against      the semantic relations identified from an additional set of admission assessment       records and a set of 300 randomly selected North American Nursing Diagnosis      Association defining characteristic phrases  The concept coverage of the ICNP was      evaluated by mapping the concepts extracted from these sources to the ICNP      concepts  The UMLS Methathesaurus was then used to map concepts without exact      matches to other American Nursing Association  ANA  recognized terminologies       RESULTS: The authors found that along with the 30 existing ICNP semantic      relations, an additional 17 are required for the ICNP to function as a      representational model for nursing assessment documentation  Eight hundred and      five unique assessment concepts were extracted from all sources  Forty-three      percent of these unique assessment concepts had exact matches in the ICNP  An      additional 20% had matches in the ICNP classified as narrower, broader, or     "other " Of the concepts without exact matches in the ICNP, 81% had exact matches      found in other ANA recognized terminologies  CONCLUSIONS: The broad concept      coverage and the logic-based structure of the ICNP make it a flexible and robust       standard  The ICNP provides a framework from which to capture and reuse atomic      level data to facilitate evidence-based practice

PMID- 19074297   - OBJECTIVE: To measure the uncertainty of temporal assertions like "3 weeks ago"      in clinical texts  DESIGN: Temporal assertions extracted from narrative clinical       reports were compared to facts extracted from a structured clinical database for       the same patients  MEASUREMENTS: The authors correlated the assertions and the      facts to determine the dependence of the uncertainty of the assertions on the      semantic and lexical properties of the assertions  RESULTS: The observed      deviation between the stated duration and actual duration averaged about 20% of      the stated deviation  Linear regression revealed that assertions about events      further in the past tend to be more uncertain, smaller numeric values tend to be       more uncertain  1 mo v  30 d , and round numbers tend to be more uncertain  10      versus 11 yrs   CONCLUSIONS: The authors empirically derived semantics behind      statements of duration using "ago," and verified intuitions about how numbers are      used

PMID- 18952949   - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to develop and evaluate an approach for auditing the      semantic completeness of the SNOMED CT contents using a formal concept analysis       FCA -based model  DESIGN: We developed a model for formalizing the normal forms       of SNOMED CT expressions using FCA  Anonymous nodes, identified through the      analyses, were retrieved from the model for evaluation  Two quasi-Poisson      regression models were developed to test whether anonymous nodes can evaluate the      semantic completeness of SNOMED CT contents  Model 1 , and for testing whether     such completeness differs between 2 clinical domains  Model 2   The data were      randomly sampled from all the contexts that could be formed in the 2 largest      domains: Procedure and Clinical Finding  Case studies  n = 4  were performed on      randomly selected anonymous node samples for validation  MEASUREMENTS: In Model      1, the outcome variable is the number of fully defined concepts within a context,      while the explanatory variables are the number of lattice nodes and the number of      anonymous nodes  In Model 2, the outcome variable is the number of anonymous      nodes and the explanatory variables are the number of lattice nodes and a binary       category for domain  Procedure/Clinical Finding   RESULTS: A total of 5,450      contexts from the 2 domains were collected for analyses  Our findings revealed      that the number of anonymous nodes had a significant negative correlation with      the number of fully defined concepts within a context  p < 0 001   Further, the      Clinical Finding domain had fewer anonymous nodes than the Procedure domain  p <       0 001   Case studies demonstrated that the anonymous nodes are an effective index      for auditing SNOMED CT  CONCLUSION: The anonymous nodes retrieved from FCA-based       analyses are a candidate proxy for the semantic completeness of the SNOMED CT      contents  Our novel FCA-based approach can be useful for auditing the semantic      completeness of SNOMED CT contents, or any large ontology, within or across      domains

PMID- 18952948   - OBJECTIVE: To test whether the anchoring and order cognitive biases experienced      during search by consumers using information retrieval systems can be corrected      to improve the accuracy of, and confidence in, answers to health-related      questions  DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted on 227 undergraduate      students who used an online search engine developed by the authors to find health      information and then answer six randomly assigned consumer health questions  The       search engine was fitted with a baseline user interface and two modified      interfaces specifically designed to debias anchoring or order effect  Each      subject used all three user interfaces, answering two questions with each       MEASUREMENTS: Frequencies of correct answers pre- and post- search and confidence      in answers were collected  Time taken to search and then answer a question, the      number of searches conducted and the number of links accessed in a search session      were also recorded  User preferences for each interface were measured  Chi-square      analyses tested for the presence of biases with each user interface  The      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked for equality of distribution of the evidence      analyzed for each user interface  The test for difference between proportions and      the Wilcoxon signed ranks test were used when comparing interfaces  RESULTS:      Anchoring and order effects were present amongst subjects using the baseline      search interface  anchoring: p < 0 001; order: p = 0 026   With use of the order       debiasing interface, the initial order effect was no longer present  p = 0 34       but there was no significant improvement in decision accuracy  p = 0 23   While      the anchoring effect persisted when using the anchor debiasing interface  p <      0 001 , its use was associated with a 10 3% increase in subjects who had answered      incorrectly pre-search, answering correctly post-search  p = 0 10   Subjects      using either debiasing user interface conducted fewer searches and accessed more       documents compared to baseline  p < 0 001   In addition, the majority of subjects      preferred using a debiasing interface over baseline  CONCLUSION: This study      provides evidence that  i  debiasing strategies can be integrated into the user     interface of a search engine;  ii  information interpretation behaviors can be to      some extent debiased; and that  iii  attempts to debias information searching by       consumers can influence their ability to answer health-related questions      accurately, their confidence in these answers, as well as the strategies used to       conduct searches and retrieve information

PMID- 18952947   - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of computerized requests for     pharmacist-to-dose  PTD , an advanced clinical decision support tool for dosing      guidance, on antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin and aminoglycosides, describe       PTD request utilization, and identify factors that may prolong this process       DESIGN: A retrospective review was conducted of patients hospitalized from Jan      2004 to Jun 2006 with suspected pneumonia who received vancomycin, tobramycin, or     gentamicin via PTD  study  or routine provider order entry  control        MEASUREMENTS: The primary endpoint was time to pharmacist completion of PTD      request  Secondary data points included medication turn-around times for first      doses of vancomycin or aminoglycosides and for first doses of any antibiotic,      dose adjustment for renal dysfunction, medication errors, and time of order     entry  Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of total time      to pharmacist verification and time to administration of first doses of      vancomycin or aminoglycosides  RESULTS: Median time for pharmacist completion of       PTD requests was 29 minutes  Delays were noted in the study group  n = 49  by      comparison with the control group  n = 48  for median time to first dose of      vancomycin or aminoglycoside  185 vs  138 min, p = 0 45  and for any antibiotic       134 vs  118 min, p = 0 42 , respectively  Fewer medication errors were reported       in the study group  5 vs  18 errors, p = 0 002   In a multivariate model, PTD was      not significantly predictive of time to pharmacy verification or medication      turn-around time  CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists completed pharmacist-to-dose      consultations for dosing guidance of vancomycin and aminoglycosides within a      median of 30 minutes  Implementation of a computerized request for clinical      pharmacists to provide medication-related clinical decision support increased      medication turn-around time of vancomycin and aminoglycosides and reduced      medication errors  Consultation of clinical pharmacists by computerized request      for initial antibiotic dosing of medications with narrow therapeutic windows is      an option for medication-related clinical decision support but providers should      be aware that consultation may delay medication turn-around time

PMID- 18952946   - OBJECTIVE: Chemical concepts assigned multiple "Chemical Viewed Structurally"      semantic types  STs  in the Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  are subject to      ambiguous interpretation  The multiple assignments may denote the fact that a      specific represented chemical  combination  is a conjugate, derived via a      chemical reaction of chemicals of the different types, or a complex, composed of       a mixture of such chemicals  The previously introduced Refined Semantic Network       RSN  is modified to properly model these varied multi-typed chemical      combinations  DESIGN: The RSN was previously introduced as an enhanced      abstraction of the UMLS's concepts  It features new types, called intersection      semantic types  ISTs , each of which explicitly captures a unique combination of       ST assignments in one abstract unit  The ambiguous ISTs of different "Chemical      Viewed Structurally" ISTs of the RSN are replaced with two varieties of new      types, called conjugate types and complex types, which explicitly denote the      nature of the chemical interactions  Additional semantic relationships help      further refine that new portion of the RSN rooted at the ST "Chemical Viewed      Structurally " MEASUREMENTS: The number of new conjugate and complex types and      the amount of changes to the type assignment of chemical concepts are presented        RESULTS: The modified RSN, consisting of 35 types and featuring 22 new conjugate       and complex types, is presented  A total of 800  about 98%  chemical concepts      representing multi-typed chemical combinations from "Chemical Viewed      Structurally" STs are uniquely assigned one of the new types  An additional      benefit is the identification of a number of illegal ISTs and ST assignment      errors, some of which are direct violations of exclusion rules defined by the      UMLS Semantic Network  CONCLUSION: The modified RSN provides an enhanced abstract      view of the UMLS's chemical content  Its array of conjugate and complex types      provides a more accurate model of the variety of combinations involving chemicals      viewed structurally  This framework will help streamline the process of type      assignments for such chemical concepts and improve user orientation to the      richness of the chemical content of the UMLS

PMID- 18952945   - OBJECTIVE: Interruptive alerts within electronic applications can cause "alert      fatigue" if they fire too frequently or are clinically reasonable only some of      the time  We assessed the impact of non-interruptive, real-time medication      laboratory alerts on provider lab test ordering  DESIGN: We enrolled 22      outpatient practices into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial  Clinics      either used the existing system or received on-screen recommendations for     baseline laboratory tests when prescribing new medications  Since the warnings      were non-interruptive, providers did not have to act upon or acknowledge the      notification to complete a medication request  MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected       each time providers performed suggested laboratory testing within 14 days of a      new prescription order  Findings were adjusted for patient and provider     characteristics as well as patient clustering within clinics  RESULTS: Among 12      clinics with 191 providers in the control group and 10 clinics with 175 providers      in the intervention group, there were 3673 total events where baseline lab tests       would have been advised: 1988 events in the control group and 1685 in the      intervention group  In the control group, baseline labs were requested for 771       39%  of the medications  In the intervention group, baseline labs were ordered      by clinicians in 689  41%  of the cases  Overall, no significant association      existed between the intervention and the rate of ordering appropriate baseline      laboratory tests  CONCLUSION: We found that non-interruptive medication      laboratory monitoring alerts were not effective in improving receipt of      recommended baseline laboratory test monitoring for medications  Further work is       necessary to optimize compliance with non-critical recommendations

PMID- 18952944   - OBJECTIVE: Interface terminologies are designed to support interactions between      humans and structured medical information  In particular, many interface      terminologies have been developed for structured computer based documentation      systems  Experts and policy-makers have recommended that interface terminologies       be mapped to reference terminologies  The goal of the current study was to      evaluate how well the reference terminology SNOMED CT could map to and represent       two interface terminologies, MEDCIN and the Categorical Health Information      Structured Lexicon  CHISL   DESIGN: Automated mappings between SNOMED CT and 500       terms from each of the two interface terminologies were evaluated by human      reviewers, who also searched SNOMED CT to identify better mappings when this was       judged to be necessary  Reviewers judged whether they believed the interface      terms to be clinically appropriate, whether the terms were covered by SNOMED CT      concepts and whether the terms' implied semantic structure could be represented      by SNOMED CT  MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included concept coverage by SNOMED CT for     study terms and their implied semantics  Agreement statistics and      compositionality measures were calculated  RESULTS: The SNOMED CT terminology      contained concepts to represent 92 4% of MEDCIN and 95 9% of CHISL terms       Semantic structures implied by study terms were less well covered, with some      complex compositional expressions requiring semantics not present in SNOMED CT       Among sampled terms, those from MEDCIN were more complex than those from CHISL,      containing an average 3 8 versus 1 8 atomic concepts respectively, p<0 001       CONCLUSION: Our findings support using SNOMED CT to provide standardized      representations of information created using these two terminologies, but suggest      that enriching SNOMED CT semantics would improve representation of the external      terms

PMID- 18952941   - OBJECTIVE: Few data exist measuring the effect of differentiating drug-drug      interaction  DDI  alerts in computerized provider order entry systems  CPOE  by      level of severity  "tiering"   We sought to determine if rates of provider     compliance with DDI alerts in the inpatient setting differed when a tiered      presentation was implemented  DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of      alert log data on hospitalized patients at two academic medical centers during      the period from 2/1/2004 through 2/1/2005  Both inpatient CPOE systems used the      same DDI checking service, but one displayed alerts differentially by severity      level  tiered presentation, including hard stops for the most severe alerts       while the other did not  Participants were adult inpatients who generated a DDI      alert, and providers who wrote the orders  Alerts were presented during the order     entry process, providing the clinician with the opportunity to change the      patient's medication orders to avoid the interaction  MEASUREMENTS: Rate of      compliance to alerts at a tiered site compared to a non-tiered site  RESULTS: We       reviewed 71,350 alerts, of which 39,474 occurred at the non-tiered site and      31,876 at the tiered site  Compliance with DDI alerts was significantly higher at      the site with tiered DDI alerts compared to the non-tiered site  29% vs  10%, p <      0 001   At the tiered site, 100% of the most severe alerts were accepted, vs       only 34% at the non-tiered site; moderately severe alerts were also more likely      to be accepted at the tiered site  29% vs  10%   CONCLUSION: Tiered alerting by      severity was associated with higher compliance rates of DDI alerts in the      inpatient setting, and lack of tiering was associated with a high override rate      of more severe alerts

PMID- 18952940   - Health care providers are legally obliged to report cases of specified diseases      to public health authorities, but existing manual, provider-initiated reporting      systems generally result in incomplete, error-prone, and tardy information flow        Automated laboratory-based reports are more likely accurate and timely, but lack       clinical information and treatment details  Here, we describe the Electronic      Support for Public Health  ESP  application, a robust, automated, secure,      portable public health detection and messaging system for cases of notifiable      diseases  The ESP application applies disease specific logic to any complete      source of electronic medical data in a fully automated process, and supports an      optional case management workflow system for case notification control  All      relevant clinical, laboratory and demographic details are securely transferred to      the local health authority as an HL7 message  The ESP application has operated      continuously in production mode since January 2007, applying rigorously validated      case identification logic to ambulatory EMR data from more than 600,000 patients       Source code for this highly interoperable application is freely available under     an approved open-source license at http://esphealth org

PMID- 18952939   - Personal health records  PHR  are a modern health technology with the ability to       engage patients more fully in their healthcare  Despite widespread interest,      there has been little discussion around PHR governance at an organizational      level  We develop a governance model and compare it to the practices of some of      the early PHR adopters, including hospitals and ambulatory care settings,      insurers and health plans, government departments, and commercial sectors       Decision-making structures varied between organizations  Business operations were      present in all groups, but patients were not represented in any of the governance      structures surveyed  To improve patient-centered care, policy making for PHRs      needs to include patient representation at a governance level

PMID- 18952938   - Electronic clinical documentation can be useful for activities such as public      health surveillance, quality improvement, and research, but existing methods of      de-identification may not provide sufficient protection of patient data  The      general-purpose natural language processor MedLEE retains medical concepts while       excluding the remaining text so, in addition to processing text into structured      data, it may be able provide a secondary benefit of de-identification  Without      modifying the system, the authors tested the ability of MedLEE to remove      protected health information  PHI  by comparing 100 outpatient clinical notes      with the corresponding XML-tagged output  Of 809 instances of PHI, 26  3 2%  were      detected in output as a result of processing and identification errors  However,       PHI in the output was highly transformed, much appearing as normalized terms for       medical concepts, potentially making re-identification more difficult  The MedLEE      processor may be a good enhancement to other de-identification systems, both      removing PHI and providing coded data from clinical text

PMID- 18952936   - Retention policies for clinical records are set primarily by the states, although      the federal government mandates minimum maintenance periods for certain classes      of patients and selected types of information  State policies vary considerably,       but most jurisdictions permit many types of data to be destroyed after some      period usually shorter than 10 years  Many health care organizations hold records      longer than mandated, but over time much clinical data are discarded or become      difficult to access  For improved care of patients and for support of research,      the nation should recognize that clinical information, both paper and electronic,      constitutes a valuable asset, the national phenome, that deserves long-term      storage in archives that preserve both the records and access to the information       The technical and social problems of establishing archiving are formidable but      offer an opportunity to exploit the potential of clinical information for public       good

PMID- 18952935   - OBJECTIVE: To develop methods for building corpus-specific sense inventories of      abbreviations occurring in clinical documents  DESIGN: A corpus of internal      medicine admission notes was collected and instances of each clinical      abbreviation in the corpus were clustered to different sense clusters  One      instance from each cluster was manually annotated to generate a final list of      senses  Two clustering-based methods  Expectation Maximization--EM and Farthest      First--FF  and one random sampling method for sense detection were evaluated      using a set of 12 clinical abbreviations  MEASUREMENTS: The clustering-based      sense detection methods were evaluated using a set of clinical abbreviations that      were manually sense annotated  "Sense Completeness" and "Annotation Cost" were      used to measure the performance of different methods  Clustering error rates were      also reported for different clustering algorithms  RESULTS: A clustering-based      semi-automated method was developed to build corpus-specific sense inventories      for abbreviations in hospital admission notes  Evaluation demonstrated that this       method could largely reduce manual annotation cost and increase the completeness       of sense inventories when compared with a manual annotation method using random      samples  CONCLUSION: The authors developed an effective clustering-based method      for building corpus-specific sense inventories for abbreviations in a clinical      corpus  To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first time clustering      technologies have been used to help building sense inventories of abbreviations      in clinical text  The results demonstrated that the clustering-based method      performed better than the manual annotation method using random samples for the      task of building sense inventories of clinical abbreviations

PMID- 18952933   - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the value of the Health Level 7/U S  Food      and Drug Administration Structured Product Labeling  SPL  drug knowledge      representation standard and its associated terminology sources for     drug-intolerance  allergy  decision support in computerized provider order entry        CPOE  systems  DESIGN: The Regenstrief Institute CPOE drug-intolerance issue      detection system and its knowledge base was compared with a method based on      existing SPL label content enriched with knowledge sources used with SPL       NDF-RT/MeSH   Both methods were applied to a large set of drug-intolerance       allergy  records, drug orders, and medication dispensing records covering      >50,000 patients over 30 years  MEASUREMENTS: The number of drug-intolerance      issues detected by both methods was counted, as well as the number of patients      with issues, number of distinct drugs, and number of distinct intolerances  The      difference between drug-intolerance issues detected or missed by either method      was qualitatively analyzed  RESULTS: Although <70% of terms were mapped to SPL,      the new approach detected four times as many drug-intolerance issues on twice as       many patients  CONCLUSION: The SPL-based approach is more sensitive and suggests       that mapping local dictionaries to SPL, and enhancing the depth and breadth of      coverage of SPL content are worth accelerating  The study also highlights      specificity problems known to trouble drug-intolerance decision support and      suggests how terminology and methods of recording drug intolerances could be      improved

PMID- 18952932   - This paper evaluates the retrieval effectiveness of relevance ranking strategies       on a collection of 55 queries and about 160,000 MEDLINE  R   citations used in      the 2006 and 2007 Text Retrieval Conference  TREC  Genomics Tracks  The authors      study two relevance ranking strategies: term frequency-inverse document frequency       TF-IDF  weighting and sentence-level co-occurrence, and examine their ability to      rank retrieved MEDLINE documents given user queries  Furthermore, the authors use      the reverse chronological order-PubMed's default display option-as a baseline for     comparison  Retrieval effectiveness is assessed using both mean average precision      and mean rank precision  Experimental results show that retrievals based on the      two strategies had improved performance over the baseline performance, and that      TF-IDF weighting is more effective in retrieving relevant documents based on the       comparison between the two strategies

PMID- 18952931   - OBJECTIVES: The authors study two approaches to assertion classification  One of       these approaches, Extended NegEx  ENegEx , extends the rule-based NegEx algorithm      to cover alter-association assertions; the other, Statistical Assertion      Classifier  StAC , presents a machine learning solution to assertion      classification  DESIGN: For each mention of each medical problem, both approaches      determine whether the problem, as asserted by the context of that mention, is      present, absent, or uncertain in the patient, or associated with someone other     than the patient  The authors use these two systems to  1  extend negation and      uncertainty extraction to recognition of alter-association assertions,  2       determine the contribution of lexical and syntactic context to assertion      classification, and  3  test if a machine learning approach to assertion      classification can be as generally applicable and useful as its rule-based      counterparts  MEASUREMENTS: The authors evaluated assertion classification      approaches with precision, recall, and F-measure  RESULTS: The ENegEx algorithm      is a general algorithm that can be directly applied to new corpora  Despite being      based on machine learning, StAC can also be applied out-of-the-box to new corpora      and achieve similar generality  CONCLUSION: The StAC models that are developed on      discharge summaries can be successfully applied to radiology reports  These      models benefit the most from words found in the +/- 4 word window of the target      and can outperform ENegEx

PMID- 18952929   - The growing numbers of topically relevant biomedical publications readily      available due to advances in document retrieval methods pose a challenge to      clinicians practicing evidence-based medicine  It is increasingly time consuming       to acquire and critically appraise the available evidence  This problem could be       addressed in part if methods were available to automatically recognize rigorous      studies immediately applicable in a specific clinical situation  We approach the       problem of recognizing studies containing useable clinical advice from retrieved       topically relevant articles as a binary classification problem  The gold standard      used in the development of PubMed clinical query filters forms the basis of our     approach  We identify scientifically rigorous studies using supervised machine      learning techniques  Naive Bayes, support vector machine  SVM , and boosting       trained on high-level semantic features  We combine these methods using an      ensemble learning method  stacking   The performance of learning methods is      evaluated using precision, recall and F 1  score, in addition to area under the      receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curve  AUC   Using a training set of      10,000 manually annotated MEDLINE citations, and a test set of an additional      2,000 citations, we achieve 73 7% precision and 61 5% recall in identifying      rigorous, clinically relevant studies, with stacking over five feature-classifier     combinations and 82 5% precision and 84 3% recall in recognizing rigorous studies      with treatment focus using stacking over word + metadata feature vector  Our     results demonstrate that a high quality gold standard and advanced classification      methods can help clinicians acquire best evidence from the medical literature

PMID- 18756002   - Patients, policymakers, providers, payers, employers, and others have increasing       interest in using personal health records  PHRs  to improve healthcare costs,      quality, and efficiency  While organizations now invest millions of dollars in      PHRs, the best PHR architectures, value propositions, and descriptions are not      universally agreed upon  Despite widespread interest and activity, little PHR     research has been done to date, and targeted research investment in PHRs appears       inadequate  The authors reviewed the existing PHR specific literature  100      articles  and divided the articles into seven categories, of which four in      particular--evaluation of PHR functions, adoption and attitudes of healthcare      providers and patients towards PHRs, PHR related privacy and security, and PHR     architecture--present important research opportunities  We also briefly discuss      other research related to PHRs, PHR research funding sources, and PHR business      models  We believe that additional PHR research can increase the likelihood that       future PHR system deployments will beneficially impact healthcare costs, quality,      and efficiency

PMID- 18756001   - Despite recognition that clinical decision support  CDS  can improve patient      care, there has been poor penetration of this technology into healthcare      settings  We used CDS to increase inpatient influenza vaccination during      implementation of an electronic medical record, in which pharmacy and nursing      transactions increasingly became electronic  Over three influenza seasons we      evaluated standing orders, provider reminders, and pre-selected physician orders       A pre-intervention cross-sectional survey showed that most patients  95%  met      criteria for vaccination  During our intervention, physicians were increasingly      likely to accept pre-selected vaccination orders, Year 1  47% , Year 2  77% ,      Year 3  83% ; however vaccine administration by nurses was suboptimal  As      electronic medical record functionality improved, patient receipt of vaccine      increased dramatically, Year 1 [0/36; 0%], Year 2 [8/66; 12%], Year 3 [286/805;      36%]  Successful use of clinical decision support to increase inpatient influenza      vaccination only occurred after initiation of CPOE for all medications and      integration of an electronic medication administration record  Also, since most      patients met criteria for influenza vaccination, complicated logic to identify      high-risk patients was unnecessary

PMID- 18755999   - OBJECTIVE: Infobuttons are decision support tools that provide links within      electronic medical record systems to relevant content in online information      resources  The aim of infobuttons is to help clinicians promptly meet their     information needs  The objective of this study was to determine whether     infobutton links that direct to specific content topics  "topic links"  are more       effective than links that point to general overview content  "nonspecific      links"   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with a control and an intervention      group  Clinicians in the control group had access to nonspecific links, while      those in the intervention group had access to topic links  MEASUREMENTS:      Infobutton session duration, number of infobutton sessions, session success rate,      and the self-reported impact that the infobutton session produced on decision      making  RESULTS: The analysis was performed on 90 subjects and 3,729 infobutton      sessions  Subjects in the intervention group spent 17 4% less time seeking for     information  35 5 seconds vs  43 seconds, p = 0 008  than those in the control      group  Subjects in the intervention group used infobuttons 20 5%  22 sessions vs       17 5 sessions, p = 0 21  more often than in the control group, but the difference      was not significant  The information seeking success rate was equally high in      both groups  89 4% control vs  87 2% intervention, p = 0 99   Subjects reported a      high positive clinical impact  i e , decision enhancement or knowledge update  in      62% of the sessions  Limitations The exclusion of users with a low frequency of      infobutton use and the focus on medication-related information needs may limit      the generalization of the results  The session outcomes measurement was based on       clinicians' self-assessment and therefore prone to bias  CONCLUSION: The results       support the hypothesis that topic links are more efficient than nonspecific links      regarding the time seeking for information  It is unclear whether the statistical      difference demonstrated will result in a clinically significant impact  However,       the overall results confirm previous evidence that infobuttons are effective at      helping clinicians to answer questions at the point of care and demonstrate a      modest incremental change in the efficiency of information delivery for routine      users of this tool

PMID- 18755998   - Development of public health informatics applications often requires the      integration of multiple data sources  This process can be challenging due to      issues such as different file formats, schemas, naming systems, and having to      scrape the content of web pages  A potential solution to these system development      challenges is the use of Web 2 0 technologies  In general, Web 2 0 technologies      are new internet services that encourage and value information sharing and      collaboration among individuals  In this case report, we describe the development      and use of Web 2 0 technologies including Yahoo! Pipes within a public health      application that integrates animal, human, and temperature data to assess the      risk of West Nile Virus  WNV  outbreaks  The results of development and testing      suggest that while Web 2 0 applications are reasonable environments for rapid      prototyping, they are not mature enough for large-scale public health data      applications  The application, in fact a "systems of systems," often failed due      to varied timeouts for application response across web sites and services,      internal caching errors, and software added to web sites by administrators to      manage the load on their servers  In spite of these concerns, the results of this      study demonstrate the potential value of grid computing and Web 2 0 approaches in      public health informatics

PMID- 18755997   - This study investigates the effects of digital image compression on automatic      quantification of immunohistochemical nuclear markers  We examined 188 images      with a previously validated computer-assisted analysis system  A first group was       composed of 47 images captured in TIFF format, and other three contained the same      images converted from TIFF to JPEG format with 3x, 23x and 46x compression       Counts of TIFF format images were compared with the other three groups  Overall,       differences in the count of the images increased with the percentage of      compression  Low-complexity images  < or =100 cells/field, without clusters or     with small-area clusters  had small differences  <5 cells/field in 95-100% of      cases  and high-complexity images showed substantial differences  <35-50      cells/field in 95-100% of cases   Compression does not compromise the accuracy of      immunohistochemical nuclear marker counts obtained by computer-assisted analysis       systems for digital images with low complexity and could be an efficient method      for storing these images

PMID- 18755996   - In order to evaluate the accuracy of existing EMR data in predicting follow-up      providers, a retrospective analysis was performed on six months of data for     inpatient and ED encounters occurring at two hospitals, and on related outpatient      data  Sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value  PPV  were calculated for each of      eight predictors, to determine their effectiveness in predicting follow-up      providers  Our findings indicate that access to longitudinal patient care records      can improve prediction of which providers a patient is likely to see      post-discharge compared to simply using Primary Care Provider data from      admissions records  Of the predictors evaluated, a patient's past appointment      history was the best predictor of which providers they would see in the future       PPV = 48% following inpatient visits, 35% following emergency department      visits   However, even the best performing predictors failed to predict more than      half of the follow-up providers and might generate many "false" alerts

PMID- 18755995   - OBJECTIVE: To externally validate EPICON, a computerized system for grouping      diagnoses from EMRs in general practice into episodes of care  These episodes can      be used for estimating morbidity rates  DESIGN: Comparative observational study        MEASUREMENTS: Morbidity rates from an independent dataset, based on      episode-oriented EMRs, were used as the gold standard  The EMRs in this dataset      contained diagnoses which were manually grouped by GPs  The authors ungrouped      these diagnoses and regrouped them automatically into episodes using EPICON  The       authors then used these episodes to estimate morbidity rates that were compared      to the gold standard  The differences between the two sets of morbidity rates      were calculated and the authors analyzed large as well as structural differences       to establish possible causes  RESULTS: In general, the morbidity rates based on      EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard  Out of 675 diagnoses, 36       5%  were considered to be deviating diagnoses  The deviating diagnoses showed      differences for two main reasons: "differences in rules between the two methods      of episode construction" and "inadequate performance of EPICON " CONCLUSION: The       EPICON system performs well for the large majority of the morbidity rates  We can      therefore conclude that EPICON is useful for grouping episodes to estimate      morbidity rates using EMRs from general practices  Morbidity rates of diseases      with a broad range of symptoms should, however, be interpreted cautiously

PMID- 18755994   - Family health history is a complex, multifaceted tool for assessing disease risk       that can offer insight into the interplay between inherited and social factors      relevant to patient care  Family health history tools in electronic health      records can enable the user to collect, represent, and interpret structured data       that properly supports clinical decisions  If these data can be made      interoperable, important health information can be shared with minimal      duplication of effort among entities involved in the continuum of patient care       This paper reviews the efforts by the American Health Information Community's      Family Health History Multi-Stakeholder Workgroup to create a core data set for     family health history information and to determine requirements to promote      incorporation of such information in electronic health records  The Workgroup is       a component of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services' Personalized      Health Care Initiative

PMID- 18755993   - There has been major progress both in description logics and ontology design      since SNOMED was originally developed  The emergence of the standard Web Ontology      language in its latest revision, OWL 1 1 is leading to a rapid proliferation of      tools  Combined with the increase in computing power in the past two decades,      these developments mean that many of the restrictions that limited SNOMED's      original formulation no longer need apply  We argue that many of the difficulties      identified in SNOMED could be more easily dealt with using a more expressive      language than that in which SNOMED was originally, and still is, formulated  The       use of a more expressive language would bring major benefits including a uniform       structure for context and negation  The result would be easier to use and would      simplify developing software and formulating queries

PMID- 18755992   - OBJECTIVE: Statistical aberrancy-detection algorithms play a central role in      automated public health systems, analyzing large volumes of clinical and      administrative data in real-time with the goal of detecting disease outbreaks      rapidly and accurately  Not all algorithms perform equally well in terms of      sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness in detecting disease outbreaks and the      evidence describing the relative performance of different methods is fragmented      and mainly qualitative  DESIGN: We developed and evaluated a unified model of      aberrancy-detection algorithms and a software infrastructure that uses this model      to conduct studies to evaluate detection performance  We used a task-analytic      methodology to identify the common features and meaningful distinctions among      different algorithms and to provide an extensible framework for gathering      evidence about the relative performance of these algorithms using a number of      evaluation metrics  We implemented our model as part of a modular software      infrastructure  Biological Space-Time Outbreak Reasoning Module, or BioSTORM       that allows configuration, deployment, and evaluation of aberrancy-detection      algorithms in a systematic manner  MEASUREMENT: We assessed the ability of our     model to encode the commonly used EARS algorithms and the ability of the BioSTORM      software to reproduce an existing evaluation study of these algorithms  RESULTS:       Using our unified model of aberrancy-detection algorithms, we successfully      encoded the EARS algorithms, deployed these algorithms using BioSTORM, and were      able to reproduce and extend previously published evaluation results  CONCLUSION:      The validated model of aberrancy-detection algorithms and its software      implementation will enable principled comparison of algorithms, synthesis of      results from evaluation studies, and identification of surveillance algorithms      for use in specific public health settings

PMID- 18755990   - The American Medical Informatics Association  AMIA  recently augmented the scope       of its activities to encompass translational bioinformatics as a third major     domain of informatics  The AMIA has defined translational bioinformatics as "          the development of storage, analytic, and interpretive methods to optimize the      transformation of increasingly voluminous biomedical data into proactive,      predictive, preventative, and participatory health " In this perspective, I will       list eight reasons why this is an excellent time to be studying translational      bioinformatics, including the significant increase in funding opportunities      available for informatics from the United States National Institutes of Health,      and the explosion of publicly-available data sets of molecular measurements  I      end with the significant challenges we face in building a community of future      investigators in Translational Bioinformatics

PMID- 18755989   - Personally controlled health records  PCHRs  enable patients to store, manage,      and share their own health data, and promise unprecedented consumer access to      medical information  To deploy a PCHR in the pediatric population requires      crafting of access and security policies, tailored to a record that is not only      under patient control, but one that may also be accessed by parents, guardians,      and third-party entities  Such hybrid control of health information requires      careful consideration of both the PCHR vendor's access policies, as well as      institutional policies regulating data feeds to the PCHR, to ensure that the      privacy and confidentiality of each user is preserved  Such policies must ensure       compliance with legal mandates to prevent unintended disclosures and must      preserve the complex interactions of the patient-provider relationship  Informed       by our own operational involvement in the implementation of the Indivo PCHR, we      provide a framework for understanding and addressing the challenges posed by      child, adolescent, and family access to PCHRs

PMID- 18755988   - The fields of health informatics and biomedical research increasingly depend on      the availability of aggregated health data  Yet, despite over fifteen years of      policy work on health data issues, the United States  U S   lacks coherent policy      to guide users striving to navigate the ethical, political, technical, and      economic challenges associated with health data use  In 2007, building on more      than a decade of previous work, the American Medical Informatics Association       AMIA  convened a panel of experts to stimulate discussion about and action on a       national framework for health data use  This initiative is being carried out in      the context of rapidly accelerating advances in the fields of health informatics       and biomedical research, many of which are dependent on the availability of      aggregated health data  Use of these data poses complex challenges that must be      addressed by public policy  This paper highlights the results of the meeting,      presents data stewardship as a key building block in the national framework, and       outlines stewardship principles for the management of health information  The      authors also introduce a taxonomy developed to focus definitions and terminology       in the evolving field of health data applications  Finally, they identify areas      for further policy analysis and recommend that public and private sector     organizations elevate consideration of a national framework on the uses of health      data to a top priority

PMID- 18579843   - The advent of electronic medical records and health information exchange raise      the possibility of expanding public health reporting to detect a broad range of      clinical conditions and of monitoring the health of the public on a broad scale        Expanding public health reporting may require patient anonymity, matching      records, re-identifying cases, and recording patient characteristics for     localization  The privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and       Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA  provide several mechanisms for public health      surveillance, including using laws and regulations, public health activities,      de-identification, research waivers, and limited data sets, and in addition,      surveillance may be distributed with aggregate reporting  The appropriateness of       these approaches varies with the definition of what data may be included, the      requirements of the minimum necessary standard, the accounting of disclosures,      and the feasibility of the approach

PMID- 18579842   - OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine the differences between ignoring  naive        and incorporating dependency  nonnaive  among linkage variables on the outcome of      a probabilistic record linkage study  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS We used the      outcomes of a previously developed probabilistic linkage procedure for different       registries in perinatal care assuming independence among linkage variables  We      estimated the impact of ignoring dependency by re-estimating the linkage weights       after constructing a variable that combines the outcomes of the comparison of 2      correlated linking variables  The results of the original naive and the new      nonnaive strategy were systematically compared for 3 scenarios: the empirical      dataset using 9 variables, the empirical dataset using 5 variables, and a      simulated dataset using 5 variables  RESULTS The linking weight for agreement on       2 correlated variables among nonmatches was estimated considerably higher in the       naive strategy than in the nonnaive strategy  16 87 vs  13 55   Therefore,      ignoring dependency overestimates the amount of identifying information if both      correlated variables agree  The impact on the number of pairs that was classified      differently with both approaches was modest in the situation in which there were       many different linking variables but grew substantially with fewer variables  The      simulation study confirmed the results of the empirical study and suggests that      the number of misclassifications can increase substantially by ignoring      dependency under less favorable linking conditions  CONCLUSION Dependency often      exists between linking variables and has the potential to bias the outcome of a      linkage study  The nonnaive approach is a straightforward method for creating      linking weights that accommodate dependency  The impact on the number of      misclassifications depends on the quality and number of linking variables      relative to the number of correlated linking variables

PMID- 18579841   - OBJECTIVE: Existing neuroanatomical ontologies, databases and information      systems, such as the Foundational Model of Anatomy  FMA , represent outgoing      connections from brain structures, but cannot represent the "internal wiring" of       structures and as such, cannot distinguish between different independent      connections from the same structure  Thus, a fundamental aspect of Neuroanatomy,       the functional pathways and functional systems of the brain such as the pupillary      light reflex system, is not adequately represented  This article identifies      underlying anatomical objects which are the source of independent connections       collections of neurons  and uses these as basic building blocks to construct a      model of functional neuroanatomy and its functional pathways  DESIGN: The basic      representational elements of the model are unnamed groups of neurons or groups of      neuron segments  These groups, their relations to each other, and the relations      to the objects of macroscopic anatomy are defined  The resulting model can be      incorporated into the FMA  MEASUREMENTS: The capabilities of the presented model       are compared to the FMA and the Brain Architecture Management System  BAMS        RESULTS: Internal wiring as well as functional pathways can correctly be      represented and tracked  CONCLUSION: This model bridges the gap between      representations of single neurons and their parts on the one hand and      representations of spatial brain structures and areas on the other hand  It is      capable of drawing correct inferences on pathways in a nervous system  The object      and relation definitions are related to the Open Biomedical Ontology effort and      its relation ontology, so that this model can be further developed into an      ontology of neuronal functional systems

PMID- 18579834   - OBJECTIVE: Computerized monitors can effectively detect and potentially prevent      adverse drug events  ADEs   Most monitors have been developed in large academic      hospitals and are not readily usable in other settings  We assessed the ability      of a commercial program to identify and prevent ADEs in a community hospital       DESIGN: and Measurement We prospectively evaluated the commercial application in       a community-based hospital  We examined the frequency and types of alerts      produced, how often they were associated with ADEs and potential ADEs, and the      potential financial impact of monitoring for ADEs  RESULTS: Among 2,407 patients       screened, the application generated 516 high priority alerts  We were able to      review 266 alerts at the time they were generated and among these, 30  11 3%       were considered substantially important to warrant contacting the physician      caring for the patient  These 30 alerts were associated with 4 ADEs and 11      potential ADEs  In all 15 cases, the responsible physician was unaware of the      event, leading to a change in clinical care in 14 cases  Overall, 23% of high      priority alerts were associated with an ADE  95% confidence interval [CI] 12% to       34%  and another 15% were associated with a potential ADE  95% CI 6% to 24%        Active surveillance used approximately 1 5 hours of pharmacist time daily       CONCLUSIONS: A commercially available, computer-based ADE detection tool was      effective at identifying ADEs  When used as part of an active surveillance      program, it can have an impact on preventing or ameliorating ADEs

PMID- 18579832   - The objective of this systematic review is to analyse the relative risk reduction      on medication error and adverse drug events  ADE  by computerized physician order     entry systems  CPOE   We included controlled field studies and pretest-posttest      studies, evaluating all types of CPOE systems, drugs and clinical settings  We      present the results in evidence tables, calculate the risk ratio with 95%      confidence interval and perform subgroup analyses for categorical factors, such      as the level of care, patient group, type of drug, type of system, functionality       of the system, comparison group type, study design, and the method for detecting       errors  Of the 25 studies that analysed the effects on the medication error rate,      23 showed a significant relative risk reduction of 13% to 99%  Six of the nine      studies that analysed the effects on potential ADEs showed a significant relative      risk reduction of 35% to 98%  Four of the seven studies that analysed the effect       on ADEs showed a significant relative risk reduction of 30% to 84%  Reporting      quality and study quality was often insufficient to exclude major sources of      bias  Studies on home-grown systems, studies comparing electronic prescribing to       handwriting prescribing, and studies using manual chart review to detect errors      seem to show a higher relative risk reduction than other studies  Concluding, it       seems that electronic prescribing can reduce the risk for medication errors and      ADE  However, studies differ substantially in their setting, design, quality, and      results  To further improve the evidence-base of health informatics, more      randomized controlled trials  RCTs  are needed, especially to cover a wider range      of clinical and geographic settings  In addition, reporting quality of health      informatics evaluation studies has to be substantially improved

PMID- 18579831   - We created a software tool that accurately removes all patient identifying      information from various kinds of clinical data documents, including laboratory      and narrative reports  We created the Medical De-identification System  MeDS , a       software tool that de-identifies clinical documents, and performed 2 evaluations       Our first evaluation used 2,400 Health Level Seven  HL7  messages from 10      different HL7 message producers  After modifying the software based on the      results of this first evaluation, we performed a second evaluation using 7,190      pathology report HL7 messages  We compared the results of MeDS de-identification       process to a gold standard of human review to find identifying strings  For both       evaluations, we calculated the number of successful scrubs, missed identifiers,      and over-scrubs committed by MeDS and evaluated the readability and      interpretability of the scrubbed messages  We categorized all missed identifiers       into 3 groups:  1  complete HIPAA-specified identifiers,  2  HIPAA-specified      identifier fragments,  3  non-HIPAA-specified identifiers  such as provider names      and addresses   In the results of the first-pass evaluation, MeDS scrubbed 11,273       99 06%  of the 11,380 HIPAA-specified identifiers and 38,095  98 26%  of the      38,768 non-HIPAA-specified identifiers  In our second evaluation  status      postmodification to the software , MeDS scrubbed 79,993  99 47%  of the 80,418      HIPAA-specified identifiers and 12,689  96 93%  of the 13,091 non-HIPAA-specified      identifiers  Approximately 95% of scrubbed messages were both readable and      interpretable  We conclude that MeDS successfully de-identified a wide range of      medical documents from numerous sources and creates scrubbed reports that retain       their interpretability, thereby maintaining their usefulness for research

PMID- 18579830   - OBJECTIVE: There is increasing pressure to share health information and even make      it publicly available  However, such disclosures of personal health information      raise serious privacy concerns  To alleviate such concerns, it is possible to      anonymize the data before disclosure  One popular anonymization approach is      k-anonymity  There have been no evaluations of the actual re-identification      probability of k-anonymized data sets  DESIGN: Through a simulation, we evaluated      the re-identification risk of k-anonymization and three different improvements on      three large data sets  MEASUREMENT: Re-identification probability is measured      under two different re-identification scenarios  Information loss is measured by       the commonly used discernability metric  RESULTS: For one of the      re-identification scenarios, k-Anonymity consistently over-anonymizes data sets,       with this over-anonymization being most pronounced with small sampling fractions       Over-anonymization results in excessive distortions to the data  i e , high      information loss , making the data less useful for subsequent analysis  We found       that a hypothesis testing approach provided the best control over     re-identification risk and reduces the extent of information loss compared to      baseline k-anonymity  CONCLUSION: Guidelines are provided on when to use the      hypothesis testing approach instead of baseline k-anonymity

PMID- 18579829   - OBJECTIVES: Chronic disease prevalence and burden is growing, as is the need for       applicable large community-based clinical trials of potential interventions  To      support the development of clinical trial management systems for such trials, a      community-based primary care research information model is needed  We analyzed      the requirements of trials in this environment, and constructed an information      model to drive development of systems supporting trial design, execution, and      analysis  We anticipate that this model will contribute to a deeper understanding      of all the dimensions of clinical research and that it will be integrated with      other clinical research modeling efforts, such as the Biomedical Research      Integrated Domain Group  BRIDG  model, to complement and expand on current domain      models  DESIGN: We used unified modeling language modeling to develop use cases,       activity diagrams, and a class  object  model to capture components of research      in this setting  The initial primary care research object model  PCROM  scope was      the performance of a randomized clinical trial  RCT   It was validated by domain       experts worldwide, and underwent a detailed comparison with the BRIDG clinical      research reference model  RESULTS: We present a class diagram and associated      definitions that capture the components of a primary care RCT  Forty-five percent      of PCROM objects were mapped to BRIDG, 37% differed in class and/or subclass      assignment, and 18% did not map  CONCLUSION: The PCROM represents an important      link between existing research reference models and the real-world design and      implementation of systems for managing practice-based primary care clinical      trials  Although the high degree of correspondence between PCROM and existing      research reference models provides evidence for validity and comprehensiveness,      existing models require object extensions and modifications to serve primary care      research

PMID- 18579828   - OBJECTIVE: To test whether the use of an evidence retrieval system that uses      clinically targeted meta-search filters can enhance the rate at which clinicians       make correct decisions, reduce the effort involved in locating evidence, and      provide an intuitive match between clinical tasks and search filters  DESIGN: A      laboratory experiment under controlled conditions asked 75 clinicians to answer     eight randomly sequenced clinical questions, using one of two randomly assigned      search engines  The first search engine Quick Clinical  QC  was equipped with      meta-search filters  the combined use of meta-search and search filters  designed      to answer typical clinical questions e g , treatment, diagnosis, and the second      'library model' system  LM  offered free access to an identical evidence set with      no filter support  MEASUREMENTS: Changes in clinical decision making were      measured by the proportion of correct post-search answers provided to questions,       the time taken to answer questions, and the number of searches and links to      documents followed in a search session  The intuitive match between meta-search      filters and clinical tasks was measured by the proportion and distribution of      filters selected for individual clinical questions  RESULTS: Clinicians in the      two groups performed equally well pre-search  Post search answers improved      overall by 21%, with 52 2% of answers correct with QC and 54 7% with LM  chi 2  =      0 33, df = 1, p > 0 05   Users of QC obtained a significantly greater percentage       of their correct answers within the first two minutes of searching compared to LM      users  QC 58 2%; LM 32 9%; chi 2  = 19 203, df = 1, p < 0 001   There was a      statistical difference for QC and LM survival curves, which plotted overall time       to answer questions, irrespective of answer  Wilcoxon, p = 0 019  and for the      average time to provide a correct answer  Wilcoxon, p = 0 006   The QC system      users conducted significantly fewer searches per scenario  m = 3 0 SD = 1 15      versus m = 5 5 SD1 97, t = 6 63, df = 72, p = 0 0001   Clinicians using the QC      system followed fewer document links than did those who used LM  respectively 3 9      links SD = 1 20 versus 4 7 links SD = 1 79, t = 2 13, df = 72, p = 0 0368   In 6       of the 8 questions, two meta-search filters accounted for 89% or more of      clinicians' first choice, suggesting the choice of filter intuitively matched the      clinical decision task at hand  CONCLUSIONS: Meta-search filters result in      clinicians arriving at answers more quickly than unconstrained searches across      information sources, and appear to increase the rate with which correct decisions      are made  In time restricted clinical settings meta-search filters may thus      improve overall decision accuracy, as fewer searches that could otherwise lead to      a correct answer are abandoned  Meta-search filters appear to be intuitive to      use, suggesting that the simplicity of the user model would fit very well into      clinical settings

PMID- 18451034   - The use of doctor-computer interaction devices in the operation room  OR       requires new modalities that support medical imaging manipulation while allowing       doctors' hands to remain sterile, supporting their focus of attention, and      providing fast response times  This paper presents "Gestix," a vision-based hand       gesture capture and recognition system that interprets in real-time the user's      gestures for navigation and manipulation of images in an electronic medical      record  EMR  database  Navigation and other gestures are translated to commands      based on their temporal trajectories, through video capture  "Gestix" was tested       during a brain biopsy procedure  In the in vivo experiment, this interface      prevented the surgeon's focus shift and change of location while achieving a      rapid intuitive reaction and easy interaction  Data from two usability tests      provide insights and implications regarding human-computer interaction based on      nonverbal conversational modalities

PMID- 18436915   - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify opportunities to safely turn off      frequently overridden drug-drug interaction alerts  DDIs  in computerized      physician order entry  CPOE   DESIGN: Quantitative retrospective analysis of drug      safety alerts overridden during 1 month and qualitative interviews with 24      respondents  18 physicians and 6 pharmacists  about turning off frequently      overridden DDI alerts, based on the Dutch drug database, in a hospital setting       Screen shots and complete texts of frequently overridden DDIs were presented to      physicians of internal medicine, cardiology, and surgery and to hospital      pharmacists who were asked whether these could be turned off hospital-wide      without impairing patient safety, and the reasons for their recommendations       RESULTS: Data on the frequency of alerts overridden in 1 month identified 3,089      overrides, of which 1,963 were DDIs  The category DDIs showed 86 different      alerts, of which 24 frequently overridden alerts, accounting for 72% of all DDI      overrides, were selected for further evaluation  The 24 respondents together made      576 assessments  Upon investigation, differences in the reasons for turning off      alerts were found across medical specialties and among respondents within a      specialty  Frequently mentioned reasons for turning off were "alert well known,"       "alert not serious," or "alert not needing  additional  action," or that the      effects of the combination were monitored or intended  For none of the alerts did      all respondents agree that it could be safely turned off hospital-wide  The      highest agreement was 13 of 24 respondents  54%   A positive correlation was      found between the number of alerts overridden and the number of clinicians      recommending to turn them off  CONCLUSION: Although the Dutch drug database is      already a selected reduction from all DDIs mentioned in literature, the majority       of respondents wanted to turn off DDI alerts to reduce alert overload  Turning      off DDI alerts hospital-wide appeared to be problematic because of differences      among physicians regarding drug-related knowledge and of differences across the      hospital in routine drug monitoring practices  Furthermore, several reasons for     suppression of alerts could be questioned from a safety perspective  Further     research should investigate when each of the following might help: changes in      alert texts; new differential alert triggers based on clinician knowledge or     specialty; and nonintrusive alert presentation so long as serum levels and      patient parameters are measured and stay within limits

PMID- 18436914   - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to design and validate a reliable instrument to      assess the quality of physician documentation  DESIGN: Adjectives describing      clinician attitudes about high-quality clinical documentation were gathered      through literature review, assessed by clinical experts, and transformed into a      semantic differential scale  Using the scale, physicians and nurse practitioners       scored the importance of the adjectives for describing quality in three note      types: admission, progress, and discharge notes  Psychometric methods including      exploratory factor analysis were applied to provide preliminary evidence for the       construct validity and internal consistency reliability  RESULTS: A 22-item      Physician Documentation Quality Instrument  PDQI  was developed  Exploratory      factor analysis  n = 67 clinician respondents  on three note types resulted in      solutions ranging from four  discharge  to six  admission and progress  factors,       and explained 65 8%  discharge  to 73%  admission and progress  of the variance        Each factor solution was unique  However, four sets of items consistently      factored together across all note types:  1  up-to-date and current;  2  brief,      concise, succinct;  3  organized and structured; and  4  correct, comprehensible,      consistent  Internal consistency reliabilities were: admission note  factor     scales = 0 52-88, overall = 0 86 , progress note  factor scales = 0 59-0 84,      overall = 0 87 , and discharge summary  factor scales = 0 76-0 85, overall =      0 88   CONCLUSION: The exploratory factor analyses and reliability analyses      provide preliminary evidence for the construct validity and internal consistency       reliability of the PDQI  Two novel dimensions of the construct for document      quality were developed related to form  Well-formed, Compact   Additional work is      needed to assess intrarater and interrater reliability of applying of the      proposed instrument and to examine the reproducibility of the factors in other     samples

PMID- 18436913   - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve naive Bayes prediction of      Medical Subject Headings  MeSH  assignment to documents using optimal training      sets found by an active learning inspired method  DESIGN: The authors selected 20      MeSH terms whose occurrences cover a range of frequencies  For each MeSH term,      they found an optimal training set, a subset of the whole training set  An      optimal training set consists of all documents including a given MeSH term  C1      class  and those documents not including a given MeSH term  C -1  class  that are      closest to the C1 class  These small sets were used to predict MeSH assignments      in the MEDLINE database  MEASUREMENTS: Average precision was used to compare MeSH      assignment using the naive Bayes learner trained on the whole training set,      optimal sets, and random sets  The authors compared 95% lower confidence limits      of average precisions of naive Bayes with upper bounds for average precisions of       a K-nearest neighbor  KNN  classifier  RESULTS: For all 20 MeSH assignments, the       optimal training sets produced nearly 200% improvement over use of the whole      training sets  In 17 of those MeSH assignments, naive Bayes using optimal      training sets was statistically better than a KNN  In 15 of those, optimal      training sets performed better than optimized feature selection  Overall naive      Bayes averaged 14% better than a KNN for all 20 MeSH assignments  Using these      optimal sets with another classifier, C-modified least squares  CMLS , produced      an additional 6% improvement over naive Bayes  CONCLUSION: Using a smaller     optimal training set greatly improved learning with naive Bayes  The performance       is superior to a KNN  The small training set can be used with other sophisticated      learning methods, such as CMLS, where using the whole training set would not be      feasible

PMID- 18436912   - OBJECTIVE: Despite the proliferation of consumer health sites, lay individuals      often experience difficulty finding health information online  The present study       attempts to understand users' information seeking difficulties by drawing on a      hypothesis testing explanatory framework  It also addresses the role of user     competencies and their interaction with internet resources  DESIGN: Twenty      participants were interviewed about their understanding of a hypothetical      scenario about a family member suffering from stable angina and then searched      MedlinePlus consumer health information portal for information on the problem      presented in the scenario  Participants' understanding of heart disease was      analyzed via semantic analysis  Thematic coding was used to describe information       seeking trajectories in terms of three key strategies: verification of the      primary hypothesis, narrowing search within the general hypothesis area and      bottom-up search  RESULTS: Compared to an expert model, participants'      understanding of heart disease involved different key concepts, which were also      differently grouped and defined  This understanding provided the framework for     search-guiding hypotheses and results interpretation  Incorrect or imprecise      domain knowledge led individuals to search for information on irrelevant sites,      often seeking out data to confirm their incorrect initial hypotheses  Online      search skills enhanced search efficiency, but did not eliminate these      difficulties  CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of their web experience and general search       skills, lay individuals may experience difficulty with health information      searches  These difficulties may be related to formulating and evaluating      hypotheses that are rooted in their domain knowledge  Informatics can provide      support at the levels of health information portals, individual websites, and      consumer education tools

PMID- 18436911   - Clinical decision support systems  CDSS  integrated within Electronic Medical      Records  EMR  hold the promise of improving healthcare quality  To date the      effectiveness of CDSS has been less than expected, especially concerning the      ambulatory management of chronic diseases  This is due, in part, to the fact that      clinicians do not use CDSS fully  Barriers to clinicians' use of CDSS have      included lack of integration into workflow, software usability issues, and      relevance of the content to the patient at hand  At Partners HealthCare, we are      developing "Smart Forms" to facilitate documentation-based clinical decision      support  Rather than being interruptive in nature, the Smart Form enables writing      a multi-problem visit note while capturing coded information and providing      sophisticated decision support in the form of tailored recommendations for care        The current version of the Smart Form is designed around two chronic diseases:      coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus  The Smart Form has potential to      improve the care of patients with both acute and chronic conditions

PMID- 18436910   - All methods of identifying medication prescribing errors are fraught with      inaccuracies and systematic bias  A systematic, efficient, and inexpensive way of      measuring and quantifying prescribing errors would be a useful step for reducing       them  We ask if rapid discontinuations of prescription-orders--where physicians      stop their orders within 2 hours--would be an expedient proxy for prescribing      errors? To study this we analyzed CPOE-system medication orders entered and then       discontinued within 2 hours  We investigated these phenomena in real time via      interviews with corresponding ordering physicians  Each order was also      independently reviewed by a clinical pharmacist or physicians  We found that of      114 rapidly discontinued orders by 75 physicians, two-thirds  35 of 53, PPV = 66;      95% CI = 53-77  of medication orders discontinued within 45 minutes were deemed      inappropriate  overdose, underdose, etc    Overall, 55%  63 of 114; 95% CI =      46-64%  of medication orders discontinued within 2 hours were deemed      inappropriate  This measure offers a rapid, constant, inexpensive, and objective       method to identify medication orders with a high probability of error  It may      also serve as a screening and teaching mechanism for physicians-in-training

PMID- 18436908   - A team of physicians, pharmacists, and informatics professionals developed a CDSS      added to a commercial electronic medical record system to provide prescribers      with patient-specific maximum dosing recommendations based on renal function  We       tracked the time spent by team members and used US national averages of relevant       hourly wages to estimate costs  The team required 924 5 hours and $48,668 57 in      estimated costs to develop 94 alerts for 62 drugs  The most time intensive phase       of the project was preparing the contents of the CDSS  482 25 hours, $27,455 61        Physicians were the team members with the highest time commitment  414 25 hours,       $25,902 04   Estimates under alternative scenarios found lower total cost      estimates with the existence of a valid renal dosing database  $34,200 71  or an       existing decision support add-on for renal dosing  $23,694 51   Development of a       CDSS for a commercial computerized prescriber order entry system requires      extensive commitment of personnel, particularly among clinical staff

PMID- 18436907   - Shortcomings surrounding the care of patients with diabetes have been attributed       largely to a fragmented, disorganized, and duplicative health care system that      focuses more on acute conditions and complications than on managing chronic      disease  To address these shortcomings, we developed a diabetes registry      population management application to change the way our staff manages patients      with diabetes  Use of this new application has helped us coordinate the      responsibilities for intervening and monitoring patients in the registry among      different users  Our experiences using this combined workflow-informatics      intervention system suggest that integrating a chronic disease registry into      clinical workflow for the treatment of chronic conditions creates a useful and      efficient tool for managing disease

PMID- 18436906   - OBJECTIVE: This study has two objectives: first, to identify and characterize      consumer health terms not found in the Unified Medical Language System  UMLS       Metathesaurus  2007 AB ; second, to describe the procedure for creating new      concepts in the process of building a consumer health vocabulary  How do the      unmapped consumer health concepts relate to the existing UMLS concepts? What is      the place of these new concepts in professional medical discourse? DESIGN: The      consumer health terms were extracted from two large corpora derived in the      process of Open Access Collaboratory Consumer Health Vocabulary  OAC CHV       building  Terms that could not be mapped to existing UMLS concepts via machine      and manual methods prompted creation of new concepts, which were then ascribed      semantic types, related to existing UMLS concepts, and coded according to      specified criteria  RESULTS: This approach identified 64 unmapped concepts, 17 of      which were labeled as uniquely "lay" and not feasible for inclusion in      professional health terminologies  The remaining terms constituted potential      candidates for inclusion in professional vocabularies, or could be constructed by      post-coordinating existing UMLS terms  The relationship between new and existing       concepts differed depending on the corpora from which they were extracted       CONCLUSION: Non-mapping concepts constitute a small proportion of consumer health      terms, but a proportion that is likely to affect the process of consumer health      vocabulary building  We have identified a novel approach for identifying such      concepts

PMID- 18436905   - OBJECTIVE: Recommendations for routine laboratory monitoring to reduce the risk      of adverse medication events are not consistently followed  We evaluated the      impact of electronic reminders delivered to primary care physicians on rates of      appropriate routine medication laboratory monitoring  DESIGN: We enrolled 303      primary care physicians caring for 1,922 patients across 20 ambulatory clinics      that had at least one overdue routine laboratory test for a given medication      between January and June 2004  Clinics were randomized so that physicians      received either usual care or electronic reminders at the time of office visits      focused on potassium, creatinine, liver function, thyroid function, and      therapeutic drug levels  MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were the receipt of      recommended laboratory monitoring within 14 days following an outpatient clinic      visit  The effect of the intervention was assessed for each reminder after     adjusting for clustering within clinics, as well as patient and provider     characteristics  RESULTS: Medication-laboratory monitoring non-compliance ranged       from 1 6%  potassium monitoring with potassium-supplement use  to 6 3%  liver     function monitoring with HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitor use   Rates of appropriate      laboratory monitoring following an outpatient visit ranged from 14%  therapeutic       drug levels  to 64%  potassium monitoring with potassium-sparing diuretic use        Reminders for appropriate laboratory monitoring had no impact on rates of      receiving appropriate testing for creatinine, potassium, liver function, renal      function, or therapeutic drug level monitoring  CONCLUSION: We identified high      rates of appropriate laboratory monitoring, and electronic reminders did not      significantly improve these monitoring rates  Future studies should focus on      settings with lower baseline adherence rates and alternate drug-laboratory      combinations

PMID- 18436904   - OBJECTIVES: Prescribing alerts generated by computerized drug decision support       CDDS  may prevent drug-related morbidity  However, the vast majority of alerts      are ignored because of clinical irrelevance  The ability to customize commercial       alert systems should improve physician acceptance because the physician can      select the circumstances and types of drug alerts that are viewed  We tested the       effectiveness of two approaches to medication alert customization to reduce      prevalence of prescribing problems: on-physician-demand versus computer-triggered      decision support  Physicians in each study condition were able to preset levels      that triggered alerts  DESIGN: This was a cluster trial with 28 primary care      physicians randomized to either automated or on-demand CDDS in the MOXXI drug      management system for 3,449 of their patients seen over the next 6 months       MEASUREMENTS: The CDDS generated alerts for prescribing problems that could be      customized by severity level  Prescribing problems included dosing errors,      drug-drug, age, allergy, and disease interactions  Physicians randomized to      on-demand activated the drug review when they considered it clinically relevant,       whereas physicians randomized to computer-triggered decision support viewed all      alerts for electronic prescriptions in accordance with the severity level they      selected for both prevalent and incident problems  Data from administrative      claims and MOXXI were used to measure the difference in the prevalence of      prescribing problems at the end of follow-up  RESULTS: During follow-up, 50% of      the physicians receiving computer-triggered alerts modified the alert threshold       n = 7 , and 21% of the physicians in the alert-on-demand group modified the      alert level  n = 3   In the on-demand group 4,445 prescribing problems were      identified, 41  0 9%  were seen by requested drug review, and in 31 problems       75 6%  the prescription was revised  In comparison, 668  10 3%  of the 6,505      prescribing problems in the computer-triggered group were seen, and 81  12 1%       were revised  The majority of alerts were ignored because the benefit was judged       greater than the risk, the interaction was known, or the interaction was      considered clinically not important  computer-triggered: 75 8% of 585 ignored      alerts; on-demand: 90% of 10 ignored alerts   At the end of follow-up, there was       a significant reduction in therapeutic duplication problems in the      computer-triggered group  odds ratio 0 55; p = 0 02  but no difference in the      overall prevalence of prescribing problems  CONCLUSION: Customization of      computer-triggered alert systems is more useful in detecting and resolving      prescribing problems than on-demand review, but neither approach was effective in      reducing prescribing problems  New strategies are needed to maximize the use of      drug decision support systems to reduce drug-related morbidity

PMID- 18436903   - The authors develop a typology of clinicians' workarounds when using barcoded      medication administration  BCMA  systems  Authors then identify the causes and      possible consequences of each workaround  The BCMAs usually consist of handheld      devices for scanning machine-readable barcodes on patients and medications  They       also interface with electronic medication administration records  Ideally, BCMAs       help confirm the five "rights" of medication administration: right patient, drug,      dose, route, and time  While BCMAs are reported to reduce medication      administration errors--the least likely medication error to be intercepted--these      claims have not been clearly demonstrated  The authors studied BCMA use at five      hospitals by:  1  observing and shadowing nurses using BCMAs at two hospitals,       2  interviewing staff and hospital leaders at five hospitals,  3  participating       in BCMA staff meetings,  4  participating in one hospital's      failure-mode-and-effects analyses,  5  analyzing BCMA override log data  The      authors identified 15 types of workarounds, including, for example, affixing      patient identification barcodes to computer carts, scanners, doorjambs, or     nurses' belt rings; carrying several patients' prescanned medications on carts       The authors identified 31 types of causes of workarounds, such as unreadable      medication barcodes  crinkled, smudged, torn, missing, covered by another label ;      malfunctioning scanners; unreadable or missing patient identification wristbands        chewed, soaked, missing ; nonbarcoded medications; failing batteries; uncertain       wireless connectivity; emergencies  The authors found nurses overrode BCMA alerts      for 4 2% of patients charted and for 10 3% of medications charted  Possible      consequences of the workarounds include wrong administration of medications,      wrong doses, wrong times, and wrong formulations  Shortcomings in BCMAs' design,       implementation, and workflow integration encourage workarounds  Integrating BCMAs      within real-world clinical workflows requires attention to in situ use to ensure       safety features' correct use

PMID- 18436902   - OBJECTIVE: A common measure of Internet search engine effectiveness is its      ability to find documents that a user perceives as 'relevant'  This study sought       to test whether user provided relevance ratings for documents retrieved by an      Internet search engine correlate with the decision outcome after use of a search       engine  DESIGN: 227 university students were asked to answer four randomly      assigned consumer health questions, then to conduct an Internet search on one of       two randomly assigned search engines of different performance, and to again      answer the question  MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked to provide a relevance      score for each document retrieved as well as a pre and post search answer to each      question  RESULTS: User relevance rankings had little or no predictive power       Relevance rankings were unable to predict whether the user of a search engine      could correctly answer a question after search and could not differentiate      between two search engines with statistically different performance in the hands       of users  Only when users had strong prior knowledge of the questions, and the      decision task was of low complexity, did relevance appear to have modest      predictive power  CONCLUSIONS: User provided relevance rankings taken in      isolation seem to be of limited to no value when designing a search engine that      will be used in a general-purpose setting  Relevance rankings may have a place in      situations in which experts provide rankings, and decision tasks are of      complexity commensurate with the abilities of the raters  A more natural metric      of search engine performance may be a user's ability to accurately complete a      task, as this removes the inherent subjectivity of relevance rankings, and      provides a direct and repeatable outcome measure which directly correlates with      the performance of the search technology in the hands of users

PMID- 18436898   - Patients who are asymptomatic carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus      aureus  MRSA  are major reservoirs for transmission of MRSA to other patients       Medical personnel are usually not aware when these high-risk patients are      hospitalized  We developed and tested an enterprise-wide electronic surveillance       system to identify patients at high risk for MRSA carriage at hospital admission       and during hospitalization  During a two-month study, nasal swabs from 153      high-risk patients were tested for MRSA carriage using polymerase chain reaction        PCR  of which 31  20 3%  were positive compared to 12 of 293  4 1%, p < 0 001       low-risk patients  The mean interval from admission to availability of PCR test      results was 19 2 hours  Computer alerts for patients at high-risk of MRSA      carriage were found to be reliable, timely and offer the potential to replace      testing all patients  Previous MRSA colonization was the best predictor but other     risk factors were needed to increase the sensitivity of the algorithm

PMID- 18436897   - OBJECTIVES: To develop mechanisms to formulate queries over the semantic      representation of cancer-related data services available through the cancer     Biomedical Informatics Grid  caBIG   DESIGN: The semCDI query formulation uses a       view of caBIG semantic concepts, metadata, and data as an ontology, and defines a      methodology to specify queries using the SPARQL query language, extended with      Horn rules  semCDI enables the joining of data that represent different concepts       through associations modeled as object properties, and the merging of data      representing the same concept in different sources through Common Data Elements       CDE  modeled as datatype properties, using Horn rules to specify additional      semantics indicating conditions for merging data  Validation In order to validate      this formulation, a prototype has been constructed, and two queries have been      executed against currently available caBIG data services  DISCUSSION: The semCDI       query formulation uses the rich semantic metadata available in caBIG to build      queries and integrate data from multiple sources  Its promise will be further     enhanced as more data services are registered in caBIG, and as more linkages can       be achieved between the knowledge contained within caBIG's NCI Thesaurus and the       data contained in the Data Services  CONCLUSION: semCDI provides a formulation      for the creation of queries on the semantic representation of caBIG  This      constitutes the foundation to build a semantic data integration system for more      efficient and effective querying and exploratory searching of cancer-related      data

PMID- 18308991   - Transfusion-related acute lung injury  TRALI , the leading cause of      transfusion-related death, is underreported by clinicians  For TRALI research, a       clinician-independent, computerized system has been developed to detect patients       with acute respiratory distress posttransfusion  A computer system generates an      alert when a blood gas result indicated a PaO2:FiO2 ratio below 300, within      twelve hours of blood issued from the blood bank for a patient  The system was      prospectively compared to conventional daily rounds in intensive care units       ICUs   We found that ICU rounds detected 9 of 14 patients  64% , while the      computer system detected 13 of 14 patients  93% , p = 0 125  ICU rounds took two       to three hours per day, while the computer system took one to one and one-half      hours per day of investigator time  In conclusion, an automatic computer alert      system was more efficient, and was as effective as conventional daily ICU rounds,      in detecting patients with posttransfusion acute respiratory distress

PMID- 18308989   - Preventive care measures remain underutilized despite recommendations to increase      their use  The objective of this review was to examine the characteristics,      types, and effects of paper- and computer-based interventions for preventive care      measures  The study provides an update to a previous systematic review  We      included randomized controlled trials that implemented a physician reminder and      measured the effects on the frequency of providing preventive care  Of the 1,535       articles identified, 28 met inclusion criteria and were combined with the 33      studies from the previous review  The studies involved 264 preventive care      interventions, 4,638 clinicians and 144,605 patients  Implementation strategies      included combined paper-based with computer generated reminders in 34 studies       56% , paper-based reminders in 19 studies  31% , and fully computerized      reminders in 8 studies  13%   The average increase for the three strategies in      delivering preventive care measures ranged between 12% and 14%  Cardiac care and       smoking cessation reminders were most effective  Computer-generated prompts were       the most commonly implemented reminders  Clinician reminders are a successful      approach for increasing the rates of delivering preventive care; however, their     effectiveness remains modest  Despite increased implementation of electronic      health records, randomized controlled trials evaluating computerized reminder     systems are infrequent

PMID- 18308988   - BACKGROUND: The authors define a DNA biobank as a repository of genetic      information correlated with patient medical records  DNA biobanks may assist in      the research and identification of genetic factors influencing disease and drug      interactions, but may raise ethical issues  How healthcare providers perceive DNA      biobanks is unknown  OBJECTIVES: To determine how useful healthcare professionals      believe DNA biobanks will be and whether these attitudes differ between private      and socialized healthcare systems  DESIGN: The authors surveyed 200 healthcare      professionals, including research and non-research focused doctors, nurses and      other staff from medical centers and independent practice in both the United      States and Scotland  The survey included fifteen items evaluated for general      receptiveness toward biobanks, presumed usefulness of biobanks and perceived      attitudes in recruiting patients for a biobank  MEASUREMENTS: A total of 81  45%       of 179 eligible participants responded: 41 from the U S  and 40 from Scotland  Of      these respondents, most  70%  were from academic centers  RESULTS: Results      indicate that there is a broadly favorable attitude in both locations toward the       creation of a DNA biobank  83%  and its perceived benefit  75%   This enthusiasm       is tempered in Scotland when respondents evaluated their comfort in consenting      patients for entry into a biobank; 16 of 40 respondents  40%  were uncomfortable       doing so, representing a significant difference from those in the U S   p=0 001        CONCLUSIONS: Despite systematic differences in healthcare practice between the      U S  and Scotland, health care professionals in both nations believe DNA biobanks      will be useful in curing disease  This finding appears to support further     development of such a research tool

PMID- 18308985   - As health care organizations dramatically increase investment in information      technology  IT  and the scope of their IT projects, implementation failures      become critical events  Implementation failures cause stress on clinical units,      increase risk to patients, and result in massive costs that are often not      recoverable  At an estimated 28% success rate, the current level of investment      defies management logic  This paper asserts that there are "chasms" in IT      implementations that represent risky stages in the process  Contributors to the      chasms are classified into four categories: design, management, organization, and      assessment  The American College of Medical Informatics symposium participants      recommend bold action to better understand problems and challenges in      implementation and to improve the ability of organizations to bridge these      implementation chasms  The bold action includes the creation of a Team Science      for Implementation strategy that allows for participation from multiple      institutions to address the long standing and costly implementation issues  The      outcomes of this endeavor will include a new focus on interdisciplinary research       and an inter-organizational knowledge base of strategies and methods to optimize       implementations and subsequent achievement of organizational objectives

PMID- 18308983   - OBJECTIVES: Effective health communication is often hindered by a "vocabulary      gap" between language familiar to consumers and jargon used in medical practice      and research  To present health information to consumers in a comprehensible      fashion, we need to develop a mechanism to quantify health terms as being more      likely or less likely to be understood by typical members of the lay public       Prior research has used approaches including syllable count, easy word list, and       frequency count, all of which have significant limitations  DESIGN: In this      article, we present a new method that predicts consumer familiarity using      contextual information  The method was applied to a large query log data set and       validated using results from two previously conducted consumer surveys       MEASUREMENTS: We measured the correlation between the survey result and the      context-based prediction, syllable count, frequency count, and log normalized      frequency count  RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between the context-based      prediction and the survey result was 0 773  p < 0 001 , which was higher than the      correlation coefficients between the survey result and the syllable count,      frequency count, and log normalized frequency count  p < or = 0 012        CONCLUSIONS: The context-based approach provides a good alternative to the      existing term familiarity assessment methods

PMID- 18308980   - OBJECTIVES: The College of American Pathologists  CAP  Category 1 quality      measures, tumor stage, Gleason score, and surgical margin status, are used by      physicians and cancer registrars to categorize patients into groups for clinical       trials and treatment planning  This study was conducted to evaluate the      effectiveness of an application designed to automatically extract these quality      measures from the postoperative pathology reports of patients having undergone      prostatectomies for treatment of prostate cancer  DESIGN: An application was      developed with the Clinical Outcomes Assessment Toolkit that uses an information       pipeline of regular expressions and support vector machines to extract CAP      Category 1 quality measures  System performance was evaluated against a gold      standard of 676 pathology reports from the University of California at Los      Angeles Medical Center and Brigham and Women's Hospital  To evaluate the      feasibility of clinical implementation, all pathology reports were gathered using      administrative codes with no manual preprocessing of the data performed       MEASUREMENTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of system      performance were measured for all three quality measures  Performance at both      hospitals was compared, and a detailed failure analysis was conducted to identify      errors caused by poor data quality versus system shortcomings  RESULTS:      Accuracies for Gleason score were 99 7%, tumor stage 99 1%, and margin status      97 2%, for an overall accuracy of 98 67%  System performance on data from both      hospitals was comparable  Poor clinical data quality led to a decrease in overall      accuracy of only 0 3% but accounted for 25 9% of the total errors  CONCLUSION:      Despite differences in document format and pathologists' reporting styles, strong      system performance indicates the potential of using a combination of regular     expressions and support vector machines to automatically extract CAP Category 1      quality measures from postoperative prostate cancer pathology reports

PMID- 18096917   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a multiple perspectives model of clinical      information system implementation, the CONTEXTual Implementation Model  CIM        Although other implementation models have been developed, few are grounded in      data and others fail to take adequate account of the clinical environment and      users' requirements  DESIGN: The CIM arose from qualitative data collected from      four clinical units in two large Australian teaching hospitals  The aim of the      study was to explore physicians' test management work practices associated with      the compulsory use of a hospital-wide, mandatory computerized provider order     entry  CPOE  system  1  The dataset consisted of non-participatory observations      of physicians using CPOE  n=55 sessions  and interviews with health professionals       n=28  about test management work practices  Data were analyzed by two      researchers independently using an iterative grounded approach  RESULTS: A core      underlying theme of 'contextual differences' emerged which explained physicians'       use of the CPOE system in the sites  The CIM focuses attention on diversity at      three contextual levels: the organizational level; the clinical or departmental      level, and the individual level  Within each of these levels there are dimensions      for consideration  for example, organizational culture, leadership and diverse      ways of working  which affect physicians' attitudes to, and use of, CPOE       CONCLUSION: The CIM provides a contextual differences perspective which can be      used to facilitate the implementation of clinical information systems  Developing      a clinical information system implementation model serves as a framework to guide      future implementations to ensure their safe and efficient use and also improve      the likelihood of uptake by physicians

PMID- 18096916   - The development of regional data-sharing among healthcare organizations is viewed      as an important step in the development of health information technology  HIT ,      but little is known about this complex task  This is a case study of a regional      perinatal data system that involved four hospitals, together responsible for over     10,000 births annually  Using standard qualitative methods, we chronicled project      milestones, and identified 31 "critical incidents" that delayed or prevented      their achievement  We then used these critical incidents to articulate six      organizational capacity domains associated with the achievement of project      milestones, and a seventh domain consisting of organizational incentives       Finally, we analyzed the relationship of milestone achievement to the presence of      these capacities and incentives  This data center case suggests four requirements      for sharing data across organizations: 1  a readiness assessment; 2  a perceived       mandate; 3  a formal governance structure; and 4  a third party IT component

PMID- 18096906   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a model designed to enable rapid detection and      assessment of biological threats that may require swift intervention by the      international public health community  DESIGN: We utilized Strauss' grounded      theory to develop an expanded model of social disruption due to biological events      based on retrospective and prospective case studies  We then applied this model      to the temporal domain and propose a heuristic staging model, the Wilson-Collmann      Scale for assessing biological event evolution  MEASUREMENTS: We retrospectively       and manually examined hard copy archival local media reports in the native      vernacular for three biological events associated with substantial social      disruption  The model was then tested prospectively through media harvesting      based on keywords corresponding to the model parameters  RESULTS: Our heuristic      staging model provides valuable information about the features of a biological      event that can be used to determine the level of concern warranted, such as      whether the pathogen in question is responding to established public health      disease control measures, including the use of antimicrobials or vaccines;      whether the public health and medical infrastructure of the country involved is      adequate to mount the necessary response; whether the country's officials are      providing an appropriate level of information to international public health      authorities; and whether the event poses a international threat  The approach is       applicable for monitoring open-source  public-domain  media for indications and      warnings of such events, and specifically for markers of the social disruption      that commonly occur as these events unfold  These indications and warnings can      then be used as the basis for staging the biological threat in the same manner     that the United States National Weather Service currently uses storm warning      models  such as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale  to detect and assess      threatening weather conditions  CONCLUSION: Used as a complement to current      epidemiological surveillance methods, our approach could aid global public health      officials and national political leaders in responding to biological threats of      international public health significance

PMID- 17947628   - OBJECTIVE: To develop an electronic health record that facilitates rapid capture       of detailed narrative observations from clinicians, with partial structuring of      narrative information for integration and reuse  DESIGN: We propose a design in      which unstructured text and coded data are fused into a single model called      structured narrative  Each major clinical event  e g , encounter or procedure  is      represented as a document that is marked up to identify gross structure       sections, fields, paragraphs, lists  as well as fine structure within sentences        concepts, modifiers, relationships   Marked up items are associated with      standardized codes that enable linkage to other events, as well as efficient      reuse of information, which can speed up data entry by clinicians  Natural      language processing is used to identify fine structure, which can reduce the need      for form-based entry  VALIDATION: The model is validated through an example of      use by a clinician, with discussion of relevant aspects of the user interface,      data structures and processing rules  DISCUSSION: The proposed model represents      all patient information as documents with standardized gross structure       templates   Clinicians enter their data as free text, which is coded by natural       language processing in real time making it immediately usable for other     computation, such as alerts or critiques  In addition, the narrative data      annotates and augments structured data with temporal relations, severity and      degree modifiers, causal connections, clinical explanations and rationale       CONCLUSION: Structured narrative has potential to facilitate capture of data      directly from clinicians by allowing freedom of expression, giving immediate      feedback, supporting reuse of clinical information and structuring data for     subsequent processing, such as quality assurance and clinical research

PMID- 17947626   - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the relationship of workarounds related      to the implementation of an electronic medication administration record and      medication safety practices in five Midwestern nursing homes  DESIGN: As a part      of a larger study, this qualitative evaluation was conducted to identify      workarounds associated with the implementation of an electronic medication      administration record  Data were collected using multimethods including direct      observation, process mapping, key informant interviews, and review of field notes      from medication safety team meetings  MEASUREMENTS: Open and axial coding      techniques were used to identify and categorize types of workarounds in relation       to work flow blocks  RESULTS: Workarounds presented in two distinct patterns,      those related to work flow blocks introduced by technology and those related to      organizational processes not reengineered to effectively integrate with the      technology  Workarounds such as safety alert overrides and shortcuts to      documentation resulted from first-order problem solving of immediate blocks       Nursing home staff as individuals frequently used first-order problem solving      instead of the more sophisticated second-order problem solving approach used by      the medication safety team  CONCLUSION: This study provides important practical      examples of how nursing home staff work around work flow blocks encountered      during the implementation of technology  Understanding these workarounds as a      means of first-order problem solving is an important consideration to      understanding risk to medication safety

PMID- 17947625   - OBJECTIVE: Explore the automated acquisition of knowledge in biomedical and      clinical documents using text mining and statistical techniques to identify      disease-drug associations  DESIGN: Biomedical literature and clinical narratives       from the patient record were mined to gather knowledge about disease-drug      associations  Two NLP systems, BioMedLEE and MedLEE, were applied to Medline      articles and discharge summaries, respectively  Disease and drug entities were      identified using the NLP systems in addition to MeSH annotations for the Medline       articles  Focusing on eight diseases, co-occurrence statistics were applied to      compute and evaluate the strength of association between each disease and      relevant drugs  RESULTS: Ranked lists of disease-drug pairs were generated and      cutoffs calculated for identifying stronger associations among these pairs for     further analysis  Differences and similarities between the text sources  i e ,      biomedical literature and patient record  and annotations  i e , MeSH and      NLP-extracted UMLS concepts  with regards to disease-drug knowledge were      observed  CONCLUSION: This paper presents a method for acquiring disease-specific      knowledge and a feasibility study of the method  The method is based on applying       a combination of NLP and statistical techniques to both biomedical and clinical      documents  The approach enabled extraction of knowledge about the drugs      clinicians are using for patients with specific diseases based on the patient      record, while it is also acquired knowledge of drugs frequently involved in      controlled trials for those same diseases  In comparing the disease-drug      associations, we found the results to be appropriate: the two text sources      contained consistent as well as complementary knowledge, and manual review of the      top five disease-drug associations by a medical expert supported their     correctness across the diseases

PMID- 17947624   - The authors organized a Natural Language Processing  NLP  challenge on      automatically determining the smoking status of patients from information found      in their discharge records  This challenge was issued as a part of the i2b2       Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside  project, to survey,      facilitate, and examine studies in medical language understanding for clinical      narratives  This article describes the smoking challenge, details the data and      the annotation process, explains the evaluation metrics, discusses the      characteristics of the systems developed for the challenge, presents an analysis       of the results of received system runs, draws conclusions about the state of the       art, and identifies directions for future research  A total of 11 teams      participated in the smoking challenge  Each team submitted up to three system      runs, providing a total of 23 submissions  The submitted system runs were      evaluated with microaveraged and macroaveraged precision, recall, and F-measure        The systems submitted to the smoking challenge represented a variety of machine      learning and rule-based algorithms  Despite the differences in their approaches      to smoking status identification, many of these systems provided good results       There were 12 system runs with microaveraged F-measures above 0 84  Analysis of      the results highlighted the fact that discharge summaries express smoking status       using a limited number of textual features  e g , "smok", "tobac", "cigar",      Social History, etc    Many of the effective smoking status identifiers benefit      from these features

PMID- 17947622   - This article describes our system entry for the 2006 I2B2 contest "Challenges in       Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data" for the task of identifying the      smoking status of patients  Our system makes the simplifying assumption that      patient-level smoking status determination can be achieved by accurately      classifying individual sentences from a patient's record  We created our system      with reusable text analysis components built on the Unstructured Information      Management Architecture and Weka  This reuse of code minimized the development      effort related specifically to our smoking status classifier  We report      precision, recall, F-score, and 95% exact confidence intervals for each metric       Recasting the classification task for the sentence level and reusing code from      other text analysis projects allowed us to quickly build a classification system       that performs with a system F-score of 92 64 based on held-out data tests and of       85 57 on the formal evaluation data  Our general medical natural language engine       is easily adaptable to a real-world medical informatics application  Some of the       limitations as applied to the use-case are negation detection and temporal      resolution

PMID- 17947620   - As part of the 2006 i2b2 NLP Shared Task, we explored two methods for determining      the smoking status of patients from their hospital discharge summaries when      explicit smoking terms were present and when those same terms were removed  We      developed a simple keyword-based classifier to determine smoking status from      de-identified hospital discharge summaries  We then developed a Naive Bayes      classifier to determine smoking status from the same records after all      smoking-related words had been manually removed  the smoke-blind dataset   The      performance of the Naive Bayes classifier was compared with the performance of      three human annotators on a subset of the same training dataset  n = 54  and      against the evaluation dataset  n = 104 records   The rule-based classifier was      able to accurately extract smoking status from hospital discharge summaries when       they contained explicit smoking words  On the smoke-blind dataset, where explicit      smoking cues are not available, two Naive Bayes systems performed less well than       the rule-based classifier, but similarly to three expert human annotators

PMID- 17947619   - The Clinical Language Understanding group at Nuance Communications has developed       a medical information extraction system that combines a rule-based extraction      engine with machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize references to       patient smoking in clinical reports  The extraction engine identifies smoking      references; documents that contain no smoking references are classified as      UNKNOWN  For the remaining documents, the extraction engine uses linguistic      analysis to associate features such as status and time to smoking mentions       Machine learning is used to classify the documents based on these features  This       approach shows overall accuracy in the 90s on all data sets used  Classification       using engine-generated and word-based features outperforms classification using      only word-based features for all data sets, although the difference gets smaller       as the data set size increases  These techniques could be applied to identify      other risk factors, such as drug and alcohol use, or a family history of a      disease

PMID- 17947616   - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of individual terminology systems should be driven in part      by the intended usages of such systems  Clinical interface terminologies support       interactions between healthcare providers and computer-based applications  They      aid practitioners in converting clinical "free text" thoughts into the      structured, formal data representations used internally by application programs        Interface terminologies also serve the important role of presenting existing      stored, encoded data to end users in human-understandable and actionable formats       The authors present a model for evaluating functional utility of interface      terminologies based on these intended uses  DESIGN: Specific parameters defined      in the manuscript comprise the metrics for the evaluation model  MEASUREMENTS:      Parameters include concept accuracy, term expressivity, degree of semantic      consistency for term construction and selection, adequacy of assertional      knowledge supporting concepts, degree of complexity of pre-coordinated concepts,       and the "human readability" of the terminology  The fundamental metric is how      well the interface terminology performs in supporting correct, complete, and      efficient data encoding or review by humans  RESULTS: Authors provide examples      demonstrating performance of the proposed evaluation model in selected instances       CONCLUSION: A formal evaluation model will permit investigators to evaluate      interface terminologies using a consistent and principled approach  Terminology      developers and evaluators can apply the proposed model to identify areas for     improving interface terminologies

PMID- 17947615   - Over the past year, several payers, employers, and commercial vendors have      announced personal health record projects  Few of these are widely deployed and      few are fully integrated into ambulatory or hospital-based electronic record      systems  The earliest adopters of personal health records have many lessons      learned that can inform these new initiatives  We present three case      studies--MyChart at Palo Alto Medical Foundation, PatientSite at Beth Israel      Deaconess Medical Center, and Indivo at Children's Hospital Boston  We describe      our implementation challenges from 1999 to 2007 and postulate the evolving      challenges we will face over the next five years

PMID- 17947614   - OBJECTIVE: Broadly, this research aims to improve the outbreak detection      performance and, therefore, the cost effectiveness of automated syndromic      surveillance systems by building novel, recombinant temporal aberration detection      algorithms from components of previously developed detectors  METHODS: This study      decomposes existing temporal aberration detection algorithms into two sequential       stages and investigates the individual impact of each stage on outbreak detection      performance  The data forecasting stage  Stage 1  generates predictions of time      series values a certain number of time steps in the future based on historical      data  The anomaly measure stage  Stage 2  compares features of this prediction to      corresponding features of the actual time series to compute a statistical anomaly      measure  A Monte Carlo simulation procedure is then used to examine the      recombinant algorithms' ability to detect synthetic aberrations injected into      authentic syndromic time series  RESULTS: New methods obtained with procedural      components of published, sometimes widely used, algorithms were compared to the      known methods using authentic datasets with plausible stochastic injected      signals  Performance improvements were found for some of the recombinant methods,      and these improvements were consistent over a range of data types, outbreak      types, and outbreak sizes  For gradual outbreaks, the WEWD MovAvg7+WEWD Z-Score      recombinant algorithm performed best; for sudden outbreaks, the HW+WEWD Z-Score      performed best  CONCLUSION: This decomposition was found not only to yield      valuable insight into the effects of the aberration detection algorithms but also      to produce novel combinations of data forecasters and anomaly measures with      enhanced detection performance

PMID- 17823086   - OBJECTIVE: The anonymization of medical records is of great importance in the      human life sciences because a de-identified text can be made publicly available      for non-hospital researchers as well, to facilitate research on human diseases       Here the authors have developed a de-identification model that can successfully      remove personal health information  PHI  from discharge records to make them      conform to the guidelines of the Health Information Portability and      Accountability Act  DESIGN: We introduce here a novel, machine learning-based      iterative Named Entity Recognition approach intended for use on semi-structured      documents like discharge records  Our method identifies PHI in several steps       First, it labels all entities whose tags can be inferred from the structure of      the text and it then utilizes this information to find further PHI phrases in the      flow text parts of the document  MEASUREMENTS: Following the standard evaluation       method of the first Workshop on Challenges in Natural Language Processing for     Clinical Data, we used token-level Precision, Recall and F beta=1  measure      metrics for evaluation  RESULTS: Our system achieved outstanding accuracy on the       standard evaluation dataset of the de-identification challenge, with an F measure      of 99 7534% for the best submitted model  CONCLUSION: We can say that our system       is competitive with the current state-of-the-art solutions, while we describe      here several techniques that can be beneficial in other tasks that need to handle      structured documents such as clinical records

PMID- 17712094   - OBJECTIVE: To characterize global structural features of large-scale biomedical      terminologies using currently emerging statistical approaches  DESIGN: Given      rapid growth of terminologies, this research was designed to address scalability       We selected 16 terminologies covering a variety of domains from the UMLS      Metathesaurus, a collection of terminological systems  Each was modeled as a      network in which nodes were atomic concepts and links were relationships asserted      by the source vocabulary  For comparison against each terminology we created      three random networks of equivalent size and density  MEASUREMENTS: Average node       degree, node degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average path length       RESULTS: Eight of 16 terminologies exhibited the small-world characteristics of a      short average path length and strong local clustering  An overlapping subset of      nine exhibited a power law distribution in node degrees, indicative of a      scale-free architecture  We attribute these features to specific design      constraints  Constraints on node connectivity, common in more synthetic      classification systems, localize the effects of changes and deletions  In      contrast, small-world and scale-free features, common in comprehensive medical      terminologies, promote flexible navigation and less restrictive organic-like      growth  CONCLUSION: While thought of as synthetic, grid-like structures, some      controlled terminologies are structurally indistinguishable from natural language      networks  This paradoxical result suggests that terminology structure is shaped      not only by formal logic-based semantics, but by rules analogous to those that      govern social networks and biological systems  Graph theoretic modeling shows      early promise as a framework for describing terminology structure  Deeper     understanding of these techniques may inform the development of scalable      terminologies and ontologies

PMID- 17712093   - Cancer staging provides a basis for planning clinical management, but also allows      for meaningful analysis of cancer outcomes and evaluation of cancer care      services  Despite this, stage data in cancer registries is often incomplete,      inaccurate, or simply not collected  This article describes a prototype software       system  Cancer Stage Interpretation System, CSIS  that automatically extracts      cancer staging information from medical reports  The system uses text      classification techniques to train support vector machines  SVMs  to extract      elements of stage listed in cancer staging guidelines  When processing new      reports, CSIS identifies sentences relevant to the staging decision, and      subsequently assigns the most likely stage  The system was developed using a      database of staging data and pathology reports for 710 lung cancer patients, then      validated in an independent set of 179 patients against pathologic stage assigned      by two independent pathologists  CSIS achieved overall accuracy of 74% for tumor        T  staging and 87% for node  N  staging, and errors were observed to mirror     disagreements between human experts

PMID- 17712091   - We implemented an automated vaccine adverse event surveillance and reporting      system based in an ambulatory electronic medical record to improve underreporting      and incomplete reporting that prevails in spontaneous systems  This automated      system flags potential vaccine adverse events for the clinician when a diagnosis       is entered, prompts clinicians to consider the vaccine as a cause of the      condition, and facilitates reporting of suspected adverse events to the Vaccine      Adverse Event Reporting System  VAERS   During five months, a total of 33,420      vaccinations were administered during 14,466 encounters  There were 5,914      follow-up contacts by vaccinees within 14 days of the vaccination visits; 686       11 6%  generated an alert  Clinicians submitted VAERS reports for 23 of these       0 69 per 1,000 vaccine doses , which is almost 6 times the dose-based reporting       rate to VAERS   1  Clinician surveys indicated that it took a minimal amount of      time to respond to the alerts  Of those who felt that an alert corresponded to an      actual vaccine adverse event, the majority used the reporting feature to file a      VAERS report  We believe that elicited surveillance via real time prompts to      clinicians holds substantial promise  By coupling simplified reporting with the      initial prompt, clinicians can consider and report a vaccine adverse event      electronically in a few moments during the office visit

PMID- 17712089   - Background Up to 38% of inpatient medication errors occur at the administration      stage  Although they reduce prescribing errors, computerized provider order entry       CPOE  systems do not prevent administration errors or timing discrepancies  This      study determined the degree to which CPOE medication orders matched actual dose      administration times  METHODS At a 658-bed academic hospital with CPOE but      lacking electronic medication administration charting, authors randomly selected       adult patients with eligible medication orders from historical 1999-2003 CPOE log      files  Retrospective manual chart audits compared expected  from CPOE  and actual      timing of medication administrations  Outcomes included: dose omissions, median      lag times between ordered and charted administrations, unauthorized doses, wrong       dose errors, and the rate of nurses' medication schedule shifting  RESULTS Dose      omissions occurred in 756 of 6019  12 6%  audited administration opportunities;      only 313 of the omissions  5 2% of opportunities  were unexplained  Wrong doses      and unexpected doses occurred for 0 1% and 0 7% of opportunities, respectively       Median lag from expected first dose to actual charted administration time was 27       minutes  IQR 0-127   Nursing staff shifted from ordered to alternate      administration schedules for 10 7% of regularly scheduled recurring medication      orders  Chart review identified reasons for dose omissions, delays, and dose      shifting  CONCLUSION Inpatient CPOE orders are legible and conveyed      electronically to nurses and the pharmacy  Nonetheless, ward-based medication      administrations do not consistently occur as ordered  Medication administration      discrepancies are likely to persist even after implementing CPOE and bar-coded      medication administration unless recommended interventions are made to address      issues such as determining the true urgency of medication administration,      avoiding overlapping duplicative medication orders, and developing a safe means      for shifting dosing schedules

PMID- 17712088   - Electronic prescribing has improved the quality and safety of care  One barrier     preventing widespread adoption is the potential detrimental impact on workflow       We used time-motion techniques to compare prescribing times at three ambulatory      care sites that used paper-based prescribing, desktop, or laptop e-prescribing       An observer timed all prescriber  n = 27  and staff  n = 42  tasks performed      during a 4-hour period  At the sites with optional e-prescribing >75% of      prescription-related events were performed electronically  Prescribers at      e-prescribing sites spent less time writing, but time-savings were offset by      increased computer tasks  After adjusting for site, prescriber and prescription      type, e-prescribing tasks took marginally longer than hand written prescriptions        12 0 seconds; -1 6, 25 6 CI   Nursing staff at the e-prescribing sites spent      longer on computer tasks  5 4 minutes/hour; 0 0, 10 7 CI   E-prescribing was not       associated with an increase in combined computer and writing time for     prescribers  If carefully implemented, e-prescribing will not greatly disrupt      workflow

PMID- 17712087   - OBJECTIVES: Languages used to specify computer-interpretable guidelines  CIGs       differ in their approaches to addressing particular modeling challenges  The main      goals of this article are:  1  to examine the expressive power of CIG modeling      languages, and  2  to define the differences, from the control-flow perspective,       between process languages in workflow management systems and modeling languages      used to design clinical guidelines  DESIGN: The pattern-based analysis was      applied to guideline modeling languages Asbru, EON, GLIF, and PROforma  We      focused on control-flow and left other perspectives out of consideration       MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated the selected CIG modeling languages and identified      their degree of support of 43 control-flow patterns  We used a set of explicitly       defined evaluation criteria to determine whether each pattern is supported      directly, indirectly, or not at all  RESULTS: PROforma offers direct support for       22 of 43 patterns, Asbru 20, GLIF 17, and EON 11  All four directly support basic      control-flow patterns, cancellation patterns, and some advance branching and      synchronization patterns  None support multiple instances patterns  They offer     varying levels of support for synchronizing merge patterns and state-based      patterns  Some support a few scenarios not covered by the 43 control-flow      patterns  CONCLUSION: CIG modeling languages are remarkably close to traditional       workflow languages from the control-flow perspective, but cover many fewer     workflow patterns  CIG languages offer some flexibility that supports modeling of      complex decisions and provide ways for modeling some decisions not covered by      workflow management systems  Workflow management systems may be suitable for     clinical guideline applications

PMID- 17712086   - OBJECTIVES: Large databases of published medical research can support clinical      decision making by providing physicians with the best available evidence  The      time required to obtain optimal results from these databases using traditional      systems often makes accessing the databases impractical for clinicians  This      article explores whether a hybrid approach of augmenting traditional information       retrieval with knowledge-based methods facilitates finding practical clinical      advice in the research literature  DESIGN: Three experimental systems were      evaluated for their ability to find MEDLINE citations providing answers to      clinical questions of different complexity  The systems  SemRep, Essie, and      CQA-1 0 , which rely on domain knowledge and semantic processing to varying      extents, were evaluated separately and in combination  Fifteen therapy and      prevention questions in three categories  general, intermediate, and specific      questions  were searched  The first 10 citations retrieved by each system were      randomized, anonymized, and evaluated on a three-point scale  The reasons for     ratings were documented  MEASUREMENTS: Metrics evaluating the overall performance      of a system  mean average precision, binary preference  and metrics evaluating      the number of relevant documents in the first several presented to a physician      were used  RESULTS: Scores  mean average precision = 0 57, binary preference =      0 71  for fusion of the retrieval results of the three systems are significantly        p < 0 01  better than those for any individual system  All three systems present      three to four relevant citations in the first five for any question type       CONCLUSION: The improvements in finding relevant MEDLINE citations due to      knowledge-based processing show promise in assisting physicians to answer     questions in clinical practice

PMID- 17712085   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate:  1  the effectiveness of wireless handheld computers for       online information retrieval in clinical settings;  2  the role of MEDLINE in      answering clinical questions raised at the point of care  DESIGN: A prospective      single-cohort study: accompanying medical teams on teaching rounds, five internal      medicine residents used and evaluated MD on Tap, an application for handheld      computers, to seek answers in real time to clinical questions arising at the      point of care  MEASUREMENTS: All transactions were stored by an intermediate      server  Evaluators recorded clinical scenarios and questions, identified MEDLINE       citations that answered the questions, and submitted daily and summative reports       of their experience  A senior medical librarian corroborated the relevance of the      selected citation to each scenario and question  RESULTS: Evaluators answered 68%      of 363 background and foreground clinical questions during rounding sessions      using a variety of MD on Tap features in an average session length of less than      four minutes  The evaluator, the number and quality of query terms, the total      number of citations found for a query, and the use of auto-spellcheck      significantly contributed to the probability of query success  CONCLUSION:      Handheld computers with Internet access are useful tools for healthcare providers      to access MEDLINE in real time  MEDLINE citations can answer specific clinical      questions when several medical terms are used to form a query  The MD on Tap      application is an effective interface to MEDLINE in clinical settings, allowing      clinicians to quickly find relevant citations

PMID- 17712084   - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine public opinion on alternatives to      project-specific consent for use of their personal information for health      research  DESIGN: The authors conducted a fixed-response random-digit dialed      telephone survey of 1,230 adults across Canada  MEASUREMENTS: We measured      attitudes toward privacy and health research; trust in different institutions to       keep information confidential; and consent choice for research use of one's own      health information involving medical record review, automated abstraction of      information from the electronic medical record, and linking education or income      with health data  RESULTS: Support was strong for both health research and      privacy protection  Studying communicable diseases and quality of health care had      greatest support  85% to 89%   Trust was highest for data institutes, university       researchers, hospitals, and disease foundations  78% to 80%   Four percent of      respondents thought information from their paper medical record should not be      used at all for research, 32% thought permission should be obtained for each use,      29% supported broad consent, 24% supported notification and opt out, and 11% felt      no need for notification or consent  Opinions were more polarized for automated      abstraction of data from the electronic medical record  Respondents were more      willing to link education with health data than income  CONCLUSIONS: Most of the       public supported alternatives to study-specific consent, but few supported use      without any notification or consent  Consent choices for research use of one's      health information should be documented in the medical record  The challenge      remains how best to elicit those choices and ensure that they are up-to-date

PMID- 17712083   - OBJECTIVE: Few research designs look at the deep structure of complex social      systems  We report the design and implementation of a multimethod evaluation      model to assess the impact of computerized order entry systems on both the      technical and social systems within a health care organization  DESIGN: We      designed a multimethod evaluation model informed by sociotechnical theory and an       appreciation of the nature of wicked problems  We mobilized this model to assess       the impact of an electronic medication management system via a three-year program      of research at a major academic hospital  MEASUREMENTS: Model components include       measurements relating to three dimensions of system impact: safety and quality,      organizational culture, and work and communication patterns  RESULTS: Application      of the evaluation model required the development and testing of purpose-built      measurement tools such as software to collect multidimensional work measurement      data  The model applied established research methods including medication error     audits and social network analysis  Design features of these tools and techniques      are described, along with the practical challenges of their implementation  The      distinctiveness of doing research within a unique paradigm of complex systems,      explicating the wickedness and the dimensionality of sociotechnical theory, is      articulated  CONCLUSION: Designing an effective evaluation model requires a deep       understanding of the nature and complexity of the problems that information      technology interventions in health care are trying to address  Adopting a      sociotechnical perspective for model generation improves our ability to develop      evaluation models that are adaptive and sensitive to the characteristics of      wicked problems and provides a strong theoretical basis from which to analyze and      interpret findings

PMID- 17712082   - The purpose of this review is to organize various published conceptions of health      numeracy and to discuss how health numeracy contributes to the productive use of       quantitative information for health  We define health numeracy as the      individual-level skills needed to understand and use quantitative health      information, including basic computation skills, ability to use information in      documents and non-text formats such as graphs, and ability to communicate orally       We also identify two other factors affecting whether a consumer can use      quantitative health information: design of documents and other information      artifacts, and health-care providers' communication skills  We draw upon the      distributed cognition perspective to argue that essential ingredients for the      productive use of quantitative health information include not only health      numeracy but also good provider communication skills, as well as documents and      devices that are designed to enhance comprehension and cognition

PMID- 17712079   - BACKGROUND: Health information exchange  HIE  is a potentially powerful      technology that can improve the quality of care delivered in emergency      departments, but little is known about emergency physicians' current perceptions       of HIE  OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess emergency physicians' perceived      needs and knowledge of HIE  METHODS: A questionnaire was developed based on      heuristics from the literature and implemented in a Web-based tool  The survey      was sent as a hyperlink via e-mail to 371 attending emergency physicians at 12      hospitals in New York City  RESULTS: The response rate was 58%  n = 216        Although 63% said more than one quarter of their patients would benefit from      external health information, the barriers to obtain it without HIE are too      high--85% said it was difficult or very difficult to obtain external data, taking      an average of 66 minutes, 72% said that their attempts fail half of the time, and      56% currently attempt to obtain external data less than 10% of the time  When      asked to create a rank-order list, electrocardiograms  ECGs  were ranked the      highest, followed by discharge summaries  Respondents also chose images over     written reports for ECGs and X-rays, but preferred written reports for advanced      imaging and cardiac studies  CONCLUSION: There is a strong perceived need for     HIE, most respondents were not aware of HIE prior to this study, and there are      certain types of data and presentations of data that are preferred by emergency      physicians in the New York City region

PMID- 17600107   - OBJECTIVE: Inefficiencies in clinical trial data collection cause delays,      increase costs, and may reduce clinician participation in medical research  In      this proof-of-concept study, we examine the feasibility of using point-of-care      data capture for both the medical record and clinical research in the setting of       a working clinical trial  We hypothesized that by doing so, we could increase      reuse of patient data, eliminate redundant data entry, and minimize disruption to      clinic workflow  DESIGN: We developed and used a point-of-care electronic data      capture system to record data during patient visits  The standards-based system      was used for clinical research and to generate the clinic note for the medical      record  The system worked in parallel with data collection procedures already in       place for an ongoing multicenter clinical trial  Our system was iteratively      designed after analyzing case report forms and clinic notes, and observing clinic      workflow patterns and business procedures  Existing data standards from CDISC and      HL7 were used for database insertion and clinical document exchange  RESULTS: Our     system was successfully integrated into the clinic environment and used in two      live test cases without disrupting existing workflow  Analyses performed during      system design yielded detailed information on practical issues affecting      implementation of systems that automatically extract, store, and reuse healthcare      data  CONCLUSION: Although subject to the limitations of a small feasibility      study, our study demonstrates that electronic patient data can be reused for     prospective multicenter clinical research and patient care, and demonstrates a      need for further development of therapeutic area standards that can facilitate      researcher use of healthcare data

PMID- 17600106   - OBJECTIVE: Computerized clinical reminders  CRs  were designed to reduce      clinicians' reliance on their memory and to present evidence-based guidelines at       point of care  However, the literature indicates that CR adoption and      effectiveness has been variable  We examined the impact of four design      modifications to CR software on learnability, efficiency, usability, and workload      for intake nursing personnel in an outpatient clinic setting  These modifications      were included in a redesign primarily to address barriers to effective CR use      identified during a previous field study  DESIGN: In a simulation experiment, 16       nurses used prototypes of the current and redesigned system in a within-subject      comparison for five simulated patient encounters  Prior to the experimental      session, participants completed an exploration session, where "learnability" of      the current and redesigned systems was assessed  MEASUREMENTS: Time, performance,      and survey data were analyzed in conjunction with semi-structured debrief      interview data  RESULTS: The redesign was found to significantly increase      learnability for first-time users as measured by time to complete the first CR,      efficiency as measured by task completion time for two of five patient scenarios,      usability as determined by all three groupings of questions taken from a commonly      used survey instrument, and two of six workload subscales of the NASA Task Load      Index  TLX  survey: mental workload and frustration  CONCLUSION: Modest design      modifications to existing CR software positively impacted variables that likely      would increase the willingness for first-time nursing personnel to adopt and      consistently use CRs

PMID- 17600104   - OBJECTIVE: A major problem faced in biomedical informatics involves how best to      present information retrieval results  When a single query retrieves many      results, simply showing them as a long list often provides poor overview  With a       goal of presenting users with reduced sets of relevant citations, this study      developed an approach that retrieved and organized MEDLINE citations into      different topical groups and prioritized important citations in each group       DESIGN: A text mining system framework for automatic document clustering and      ranking organized MEDLINE citations following simple PubMed queries  The system      grouped the retrieved citations, ranked the citations in each cluster, and      generated a set of keywords and MeSH terms to describe the common theme of each      cluster  MEASUREMENTS: Several possible ranking functions were compared,      including citation count per year  CCPY , citation count  CC , and journal impact      factor  JIF   We evaluated this framework by identifying as "important" those      articles selected by the Surgical Oncology Society  RESULTS: Our results showed      that CCPY outperforms CC and JIF, i e , CCPY better ranked important articles      than did the others  Furthermore, our text clustering and knowledge extraction      strategy grouped the retrieval results into informative clusters as revealed by      the keywords and MeSH terms extracted from the documents in each cluster       CONCLUSIONS: The text mining system studied effectively integrated text      clustering, text summarization, and text ranking and organized MEDLINE retrieval       results into different topical groups

PMID- 17600103   - OBJECTIVE: To specify and identify disease and patient care processes represented      by temporal patterns in clinical events and observations, and retrieve patient      populations containing those patterns from clinical data repositories, in support      of clinical research, outcomes studies, and quality assurance  DESIGN: A data      processing method called PROTEMPA  Process-oriented Temporal Analysis  was      developed for defining and detecting clinically relevant temporal and      mathematical patterns in retrospective data  PROTEMPA provides for portability      across data sources, "pluggable" data processing environments, and the creation      of libraries of pattern definitions and data processing algorithms  MEASUREMENTS:      A proof-of-concept implementation of PROTEMPA in Java was evaluated against      standard SQL queries for its ability to identify patients from a large clinical      data repository who show the features of HELLP syndrome, and categorize those      patients by disease severity and progression based on time sequence      characteristics in their clinical laboratory test results  RESULTS were verified       by manual case review  RESULTS: The proof-of-concept implementation was more      accurate than SQL in identifying patients with HELLP and correctly assigned      severity and disease progression categories, which was not possible using SQL      only  CONCLUSIONS: PROTEMPA supports the identification and categorization of      patients with complex disease based on the characteristics of and relationships      between time sequences in multiple data types  Identifying patient populations      who share these types of patterns may be useful when patient features of interest      do not have standard codes, are poorly-expressed in coding schemes, may be      inaccurately or incompletely coded, or are not represented explicitly as data      values

PMID- 17600101   - OBJECTIVE: In recent years, influenza surveillance data has expanded to include      alternative sources such as emergency department data, absenteeism reports,      pharmaceutical sales, website access and health advice calls  This study presents      a review of alternative data sources for influenza surveillance, summarizes the      time advantage or timeliness of each source relative to traditional reporting and      discusses the strengths and weaknesses of competing approaches  METHODS: A      literature search was conducted on Medline to identify relevant articles      published after 1990  A total of 15 articles were obtained that reported the      timeliness of an influenza surveillance system  Timeliness was described by peak       comparison, aberration detection comparison and correlation  RESULTS: Overall,      the data sources were highly correlated with traditional sources and had variable      timeliness  Over-the-counter pharmaceutical sales, emergency visits, absenteeism       and health calls appear to be more timely than physician diagnoses, sentinel      influenza-like-illness surveillance and virological confirmation  CONCLUSIONS:      The methods used to describe timeliness vary greatly between studies and hence no      strong conclusions regarding the most timely source/s of data can be reached       Future studies should apply the aberration detection method to determine data      source timeliness in preference to the peak comparison method and correlation

PMID- 17600100   - In this report, we describe the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated       Surveillance system  AEGIS , developed for real-time population health monitoring      in the state of Massachusetts  AEGIS provides public health personnel with      automated near-real-time situational awareness of utilization patterns at      participating healthcare institutions, supporting surveillance of bioterrorism      and naturally occurring outbreaks  As real-time public health surveillance      systems become integrated into regional and national surveillance initiatives,      the challenges of scalability, robustness, and data security become increasingly       prominent  A modular and fault tolerant design helps AEGIS achieve scalability      and robustness, while a distributed storage model with local autonomy helps to      minimize risk of unauthorized disclosure  The report includes a description of      the evolution of the design over time in response to the challenges of a regional      and national integration environment

PMID- 17600099   - Part-of-speech tagging represents an important first step for most medical      natural language processing  NLP  systems  The majority of current      statistically-based POS taggers are trained using a general English corpus       Consequently, these systems perform poorly on medical text  Annotated medical      corpora are difficult to develop because of the time and labor required  We      investigated a heuristic-based sample selection method to minimize annotated      corpus size for retraining a Maximum Entropy  ME  POS tagger  We developed a      manually annotated domain specific corpus  DSC  of surgical pathology reports and      a domain specific lexicon  DL   We sampled the DSC using two heuristics to      produce smaller training sets and compared the retrained performance against  1        the original ME modeled tagger trained on general English,  2  the ME tagger     retrained on the DL, and  3  the MedPost tagger trained on MEDLINE abstracts       RESULTS showed that the ME tagger retrained with a DSC was superior to the tagger     retrained with the DL, and also superior to MedPost  Heuristic methods for sample      selection produced performance equivalent to use of the entire training set, but       with many fewer sentences  Learning curve analysis showed that sample selection      would enable an 84% decrease in the size of the training set without a decrement       in performance  We conclude that heuristic sample selection can be used to      markedly reduce human annotation requirements for training of medical NLP      systems

PMID- 17600097   - OBJECTIVE: To test whether individuals experience cognitive biases whilst      searching using information retrieval systems  Biases investigated are anchoring,      order, exposure and reinforcement  DESIGN: A retrospective analysis and a      prospective experiment were conducted to investigate whether cognitive biases      affect the way that documentary evidence is interpreted while searching online       The retrospective analysis was conducted on the search and decision behaviors of       75 clinicians  44 doctors, 31 nurses , answering questions for 8 clinical      scenarios within 80 minutes in a controlled setting  The prospective study was      conducted on 227 undergraduate students, who used the same search engine to      answer two of six randomly assigned consumer health questions  MEASUREMENTS:      Frequencies of correct answers pre- and post- search, and confidence in answers      were collected  The impact of reading a document on the final decision was      measured by the population likelihood ratio  LR  of the frequency of reading the       document and the frequency of obtaining a correct answer  Documents with a LR > 1      were most likely to be associated with a correct answer, and those with a LR < 1       were most likely to be associated with an incorrect answer to a question       Agreement between a subject and the evidence they read was estimated by a      concurrence rate, which measured the frequency that subjects' answers agreed with      the likelihood ratios of a group of documents, normalized for document order,      time exposure or reinforcement through repeated access  Serial position curves      were plotted for the relationship between subjects' pre-search confidence,      document order, the number of times and length of time a document was accessed,      and concurrence with post-search answers  Chi-square analyses tested for the      presence of biases, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked for equality of      distribution of evidence in the comparison populations  RESULTS: A person's prior     belief  anchoring  has a significant impact on their post-search answer      retrospective: P < 0 001; prospective: P < 0 001   Documents accessed at      different positions in a search session  order effect [retrospective: P = 0 76;      prospective: P = 0 026] , and documents processed for different lengths of time       exposure effect [retrospective: P = 0 27; prospective: P = 0 0081]  also      influenced decision post-search more than expected in the prospective experiment       but not in the retrospective analysis  Reinforcement through repeated exposure to      a document did not yield statistical differences in decision outcome post-search        retrospective: P = 0 31; prospective: P = 0 81   CONCLUSION: People may      experience anchoring, exposure and order biases while searching for information,       and these biases may influence the quality of decision making during and after     the use of information retrieval systems

PMID- 17600096   - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes a successful approach to de-identification that      was developed to participate in a recent AMIA-sponsored challenge evaluation       METHOD: Our approach focused on rapid adaptation of existing toolkits for named      entity recognition using two existing toolkits, Carafe and LingPipe  RESULTS: The      "out of the box" Carafe system achieved a very good score  phrase F-measure of      0 9664  with only four hours of work to adapt it to the de-identification task       With further tuning, we were able to reduce the token-level error term by over     36% through task-specific feature engineering and the introduction of a lexicon,       achieving a phrase F-measure of 0 9736  CONCLUSIONS: We were able to achieve good      performance on the de-identification task by the rapid retargeting of existing      toolkits  For the Carafe system, we developed a method for tuning the balance of       recall vs  precision, as well as a confidence score that correlated well with the      measured F-score

PMID- 17600095   - Parallel to the monumental problem of replacing paper-and-pen-based patient      information management systems with electronic ones is the problem of evaluating       the extent to which the change represents an improvement  All clinicians must      grapple with this daunting challenge; those with little or no informatics      expertise may be particularly surprised by the attendant difficulties  To do so      successfully, they must be able to explicitly conceptualize the daily clinical      work-a prerequisite for appreciating and reasonably evaluating it  Further, few      of these evaluators may have reflected on the dynamic interaction between their     work and their tools-how changing a tool necessarily changes the work  This      article illuminates these problems by telling the story of how one patient care      information systems committee first learned to think about the purpose of a      patient information management system, and second, how to evaluate the impact of       its implementation

PMID- 17600094   - To facilitate and survey studies in automatic de-identification, as a part of the      i2b2  Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside  project, authors      organized a Natural Language Processing  NLP  challenge on automatically removing      private health information  PHI  from medical discharge records  This manuscript       provides an overview of this de-identification challenge, describes the data and       the annotation process, explains the evaluation metrics, discusses the nature of       the systems that addressed the challenge, analyzes the results of received system      runs, and identifies directions for future research  The de-indentification      challenge data consisted of discharge summaries drawn from the Partners      Healthcare system  Authors prepared this data for the challenge by replacing      authentic PHI with synthesized surrogates  To focus the challenge on      non-dictionary-based de-identification methods, the data was enriched with      out-of-vocabulary PHI surrogates, i e , made up names  The data also included      some PHI surrogates that were ambiguous with medical non-PHI terms  A total of      seven teams participated in the challenge  Each team submitted up to three system      runs, for a total of sixteen submissions  The authors used precision, recall, and      F-measure to evaluate the submitted system runs based on their token-level and      instance-level performance on the ground truth  The systems with the best      performance scored above 98% in F-measure for all categories of PHI  Most      out-of-vocabulary PHI could be identified accurately  However, identifying      ambiguous PHI proved challenging  The performance of systems on the test data set      is encouraging  Future evaluations of these systems will involve larger data sets      from more heterogeneous sources

PMID- 17600093   - Many unintended and undesired consequences of Healthcare Information Technologies       HIT  flow from interactions between the HIT and the healthcare organization's      sociotechnical system-its workflows, culture, social interactions, and      technologies  This paper develops and illustrates a conceptual model of these      processes that we call Interactive Sociotechnical Analysis  ISTA   ISTA captures       common types of interaction with special emphasis on recursive processes, i e ,      feedback loops that alter the newly introduced HIT and promote second-level      changes in the social system  ISTA draws on prior studies of unintended      consequences, along with research in sociotechnical systems, ergonomics, social      informatics, technology-in-practice, and social construction of technology  We      present five types of sociotechnical interaction and illustrate each with cases      from published research  The ISTA model should further research on emergent and      recursive processes in HIT implementation and their unintended consequences       Familiarity with the model can also foster practitioners' awareness of      unanticipated consequences that only become evident during HIT implementation

PMID- 17460139   - OBJECTIVES: A  Identify the current state of data management needs of academic      biomedical researchers  B  Explore their anticipated data management and analysis      needs  C  Identify barriers to addressing those needs  DESIGN: A multimodal needs      analysis was conducted using a combination of an online survey and in-depth      one-on-one semi-structured interviews  Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list      representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific      Northwest  MEASUREMENTS: The results from 286 survey respondents were used to      provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15      semi-structured in-depth interviews  RESULTS: Three major themes were identified:      1  there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for     core data management; 2  there is broad perceived need for additional support in       managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3  the barriers to acquiring currently      available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and       unmet expectations of institutional support  CONCLUSION: Themes identified in      this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be      served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve      their own problems  Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on      three components: 1  facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange      models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of      interoperability and analysis; 2  improve the ability of researchers to maintain       provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the      leveraging of standards; and 3  develop and support information management      service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing      researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a      spectrum of informatics capabilities

PMID- 17460138   - Clinical investigators often preprocess, process, and analyze their data without       benefit of formally organized research centers to oversee data management  This      article outlines a practical three-file structure to help guide these      investigators track and document their data through processing and analyses  The       proposed process can be implemented without additional training or specialized      software  Thus, it is particularly well suited for research projects with small      budgets or limited access to viable research/data coordinating centers

PMID- 17460137   - This paper provides a systematic literature review of CPOE evaluation studies in       the outpatient setting on: safety; cost and efficiency; adherence to guideline;      alerts; time; and satisfaction, usage, and usability  Thirty articles with      original data  randomized clinical trial, non-randomized clinical trial, or     observational study designs  met the inclusion criteria  Only four studies      assessed the effect of CPOE on safety  The effect was not significant on the      number of adverse drug events  Only one study showed a significant reduction of      the number of medication errors  Three studies showed significant reductions in      medication costs; five other studies could not support this  Most studies on      adherence to guidelines showed a significant positive effect  The relatively      small number of evaluation studies published to date do not provide adequate      evidence that CPOE systems enhance safety and reduce cost in the outpatient      settings  There is however evidence for  a  increasing adherence to guidelines,       b  increasing total prescribing time, and  c  high frequency of ignored alerts

PMID- 17460136   - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore physician organizations' adoption of      chronic care guidelines in order entry systems and to investigate the      organizational and market-related factors associated with this adoption  DESIGN:       A quantitative nationwide survey of all primary care medical groups in the United      States with 20 or more physicians; data were collected on 1,104 physician      organizations, representing a 70% response rate  MEASUREMENTS: Measurements were       the presence of an asthma, diabetes, or congestive heart failure guideline in a      physician organization's order entry system; size; age of the organization;      number of clinic locations; type of ownership; health maintenance organization      market penetration; urban/rural location; and presence of external incentives to       improve quality of care  RESULTS: Only 27% of organizations reported access to      order entry with decision support for chronic disease care  External incentives      for quality is the only factor significantly associated with adoption of these      tools  Organizations experiencing greater external incentives for quality are      more likely to adopt order entry with decision support  CONCLUSION: Because      external incentives are strong drivers of adoption, policies requiring reporting       of chronic care measurements and rewarding improvement as well as financial      incentives for use of specific information technology tools are likely to      accelerate adoption of order entry with decision support

PMID- 17460135   - OBJECTIVE: Communication of abnormal test results in the outpatient setting is      prone to error  Using information technology can improve communication and      improve patient safety  We standardized processes and procedures in a      computerized test result notification system and examined their effectiveness to       reduce errors in communication of abnormal imaging results  DESIGN: We      prospectively analyzed outcomes of computerized notification of abnormal test      results  alerts  that providers did not explicitly acknowledge receiving in the      electronic medical record of an ambulatory multispecialty clinic  MEASUREMENTS:      In the study period, 190,799 outpatient visits occurred and 20,680 outpatient      imaging tests were performed  We tracked 1,017 transmitted alerts electronically       Using a taxonomy of communication errors, we focused on alerts in which errors in      acknowledgment and reception occurred  Unacknowledged alerts were identified      through electronic tracking  Among these, we performed chart reviews to determine      any evidence of documented response, such as ordering a follow-up test or     consultation  If no response was documented, we contacted providers by telephone       to determine their awareness of the test results and any follow-up action they      had taken  These processes confirmed the presence or absence of alert reception        RESULTS: Providers failed to acknowledge receipt of over one-third  368 of 1,017       of transmitted alerts  In 45 of these cases  4% of abnormal results , the imaging      study was completely lost to follow-up 4 weeks after the date of study  Overall,       0 2% of outpatient imaging was lost to follow-up  The rate of lost to follow-up      imaging was 0 02% per outpatient visit  CONCLUSION: Imaging results continue to      be lost to follow-up in a computerized test result notification system that      alerted physicians through the electronic medical record  Although comparison      data from previous studies are limited, the rate of results lost to follow-up      appears to be lower than that reported in systems that do not use information      technology comparable to what we evaluated

PMID- 17460134   - BACKGROUND: We assessed whether medication safety improved when a medication      profiling program was added to a computerized provider order entry system       DESIGN: Between June 2001 and January 2002 we profiled outpatients with potential      prescribing errors using computerized retrospective drug utilization software  We      focused primarily on drug interactions  Patients were randomly assigned either to      Provider Feedback or to Usual Care  Subsequent adverse drug event  ADE  incidence      and other outcomes, including ADE preventability and severity, occurring up to 1       year following the last profiling date were evaluated retrospectively by a      pharmacist blinded to patient assignment  MEASUREMENTS: Data were abstracted      using a study-designed instrument  An ADE was defined by an Adverse Drug Reaction      Probability scale score of 1 or more  Statistical analyses included negative      binomial regression for comparing ADE incidence  RESULTS: Of 913 patients in the       analytic sample, 371 patients  41%  had one or more ADEs  Incidence, by      individual, was not significantly different between Usual Care and Provider     Feedback groups  37% vs  45%; p = 0 06; Coefficient, 0 19; 95% CI: -0 008,      0 390   ADE severity was also similar  For example, 51% of ADEs in the Usual Care      and 58% in the Provider Feedback groups involved symptoms that were not serious       95% CI for the difference, -15%, 2%   Finally, ADE preventability did not      differ  For example, 16% in the Usual Care group and 17% in the Provider Feedback      group had an associated warning  95% CI for the difference, -7 to 5%; p = 0 79         CONCLUSION: Medications safety did not improve with the addition of a medication       profiling program to an electronic prescribing system

PMID- 17460133   - OBJECTIVE: Approximately 25% of all general dentists practicing in the United      States use a computer in the dental operatory  Only 1 8% maintain completely      electronic records  Anecdotal evidence suggests that dental computer-based      patient records  CPR  do not represent clinical information with the same degree       of completeness and fidelity as paper records  The objective of this study was to      develop a basic content model for clinical information in paper-based records and      examine its degree of coverage by CPRs  DESIGN: We compiled a baseline dental      record  BDR  from a purposive sample of 10 paper record formats  two from dental       schools and four each from dental practices and commercial sources   We extracted      all clinical data fields, removed duplicates, and organized the resulting      collection in categories/subcategories  We then mapped the fields in four     market-leading dental CPRs to the BDR  MEASUREMENTS: We calculated frequency      counts of BDR categories and data fields for all paper-based and computer-based      record formats, and cross-mapped information coverage at both the category and      the data field level  RESULTS: The BDR had 20 categories and 363 data fields  On       average, paper records and CPRs contained 14 categories, and 210 and 174 fields,       respectively  Only 72, or 20%, of the BDR fields occurred in five or more paper     records  Categories related to diagnosis were missing from most paper-based and      computer-based record formats  The CPRs rarely used the category names and      groupings of data fields common in paper formats  CONCLUSION: Existing paper     records exhibit limited agreement on what information dental records should      contain  The CPRs only cover this information partially, and may thus impede the       adoption of electronic patient records

PMID- 17460132   - Personal health records  PHRs  hold great promise for empowering patients and      increasing the accuracy and completeness of health information  We reviewed two      small USB-based PHR devices that allow a patient to easily store and transport      their personal health information  Both devices offer password protection and      encryption features  Analysis of the devices shows that they store their data in       a Microsoft Access database  Due to a flaw in the encryption of this database,      recovering the user's password can be accomplished with minimal effort  Our     analysis also showed that, rather than encrypting health information with the      password chosen by the user, the devices stored the user's password as a string      in the database and then encrypted that database with a common password set by      the manufacturer  This is another serious vulnerability  This article describes      the weaknesses we discovered, outlines three critical flaws with the security      model used by the devices, and recommends four guidelines for improving the      security of similar devices

PMID- 17460131   - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to develop a functional taxonomy of rule-based      clinical decision support  DESIGN: The rule-based clinical decision support      content of a large integrated delivery network with a long history of      computer-based point-of-care decision support was reviewed and analyzed along      four functional dimensions: trigger, input data elements, interventions, and      offered choices  RESULTS: A total of 181 rule types were reviewed, comprising      7,120 different instances of rule usage  A total of 42 taxa were identified      across the four categories  Many rules fell into multiple taxa in a given      category  Entered order and stored laboratory result were the most common      triggers; laboratory result, drug list, and hospital unit were the most frequent       data elements used  Notify and log were the most common interventions, and write       order, defer warning, and override rule were the most common offered choices       CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of taxa successfully described a large body      of clinical knowledge  These taxa can be directly mapped to functions of clinical      systems and decision support systems, providing feature guidance for developers,       implementers, and certifiers of clinical information systems

PMID- 17460130   - OBJECTIVE: Despite demonstrated benefits, few healthcare organizations have      implemented clinical event monitors to detect adverse drug events  ADEs   The      objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of pharmacy and      laboratory signals used by clinical event monitors to detect ADEs in hospitalized      adults  DESIGN: We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINHAL and EMBASE      to identify studies published between 1985 through 2006  Studies were included if      they: described a clinical event monitor to detect ADEs in an adult hospital      setting; described laboratory or pharmacy ADE signals; and, provided positive      predictive values  PPVs  or information to allow the calculation of PPVs for     individual ADE signals  MEASUREMENTS: We calculated overall estimates of PPVs and      95% confidence intervals  CIs  for signals reported in 2 or more studies and      contained no evidence heterogeneity  Results were examined by signal category:      medication levels, laboratory tests, or antidotes  RESULTS: We identified 12      observational studies describing 36 unique ADE signals  Fifteen signals  3      antidotes, 4 medication levels, and 8 laboratory values  contained no evidence of      heterogeneity  The pooled PPVs for these individual signals ranged from 0 03      [CI=0 03-0 03] for hypokalemia, to 0 50 [CI=0 39-0 61] for supratherapeutic      quinidine level  In general, antidotes  range=0 09-0 11  had the lowest PPVs,      followed by laboratory values  0 03-0 27 , and medication levels  0 03-0 50        CONCLUSION: Results from this study should help clinical information system and      computerized decision support producers develop or improve existing clinical      event monitors to detect ADEs in their own hospitals by prioritizing those      signals with the highest PPVs [corrected]

PMID- 17460128   - OBJECTIVE: To compare consistency of coding among professional SNOMED CT coders      representing three commercial providers of coding services when coding clinical      research concepts with SNOMED CT  DESIGN: A sample of clinical research questions      from case report forms  CRFs  generated by the NIH-funded Rare Disease Clinical      Research Network  RDCRN  were sent to three coding companies with instructions to      code the core concepts using SNOMED CT  The sample consisted of 319      question/answer pairs from 15 separate studies  The companies were asked to      select SNOMED CT concepts  in any form, including post-coordinated  that capture       the core concept s  reflected in the question  Also, they were asked to state      their level of certainty, as well as how precise they felt their coding was       MEASUREMENTS: Basic frequencies were calculated to determine raw level agreement       among the companies and other descriptive information  Krippendorff's alpha was      used to determine a statistical measure of agreement among the coding companies      for several measures  semantic, certainty, and precision   RESULTS: No      significant level of agreement among the experts was found  CONCLUSION: There is       little semantic agreement in coding of clinical research data items across coders      from 3 professional coding services, even using a very liberal definition of      agreement

PMID- 17460127   - BACKGROUND: Computerized provider order entry  CPOE  systems can help hospitals      improve health care quality, but they can also introduce new problems  The extent      to which hospitals experience unintended consequences of CPOE, which include more      than errors, has not been quantified in prior research  OBJECTIVE: To discover     the extent and importance of unintended adverse consequences related to CPOE      implementation in U S  hospitals  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Building on       a prior qualitative study involving fieldwork at five hospitals, we developed and      then administered a telephone survey concerning the extent and importance of      CPOE-related unintended adverse consequences to representatives from 176      hospitals in the U S  that have CPOE  MEASUREMENTS: Self report by key informants      of the extent and level of importance to the overall function of the hospital of       eight types of unintended adverse consequences experienced by sites with      inpatient CPOE  RESULTS We found that hospitals experienced all eight types of      unintended adverse consequences, although respondents identified several they      considered more important than others  Those related to new work/more work,      workflow, system demands, communication, emotions, and dependence on the      technology were ranked as most severe, with at least 72% of respondents ranking      them as moderately to very important  Hospital representatives are less sure      about shifts in the power structure and CPOE as a new source of errors  There is       no relation between kinds of unintended consequences and number of years CPOE has      been used  Despite the relatively short length of time most hospitals have had      CPOE  median five years , it is highly infused, or embedded, within work practice      at most of these sites  CONCLUSIONS: The unintended consequences of CPOE are      widespread and important to those knowledgeable about CPOE in hospitals  They can      be positive, negative, or both, depending on one's perspective, and they continue      to exist over the duration of use  Aggressive detection and management of adverse      unintended consequences is vital for CPOE success

PMID- 17460122   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of unanswered clinical questions and      propose interventions that could improve the chance of finding answers  DESIGN:      In a previous study, investigators observed primary care physicians in their     offices and recorded questions that arose during patient care  Questions that      were pursued by the physician, but remained unanswered, were grouped into generic      types  In the present study, investigators attempted to answer these questions      and developed recommendations aimed at improving the success rate of finding      answers  MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of unanswered question types and recommendations      to increase the chance of finding answers  RESULTS: In an earlier study, 48      physicians asked 1062 questions during 192 half-day office observations       Physicians could not find answers to 237  41%  of the 585 questions they pursued       The present study grouped the unanswered questions into 19 generic types  Three      types accounted for 128  54%  of the unanswered questions:  1  "Undiagnosed      finding" questions asked about the management of abnormal clinical findings, such      as symptoms, signs, and test results  What is the approach to finding X? ;  2       "Conditional" questions contained qualifying conditions that were appended to      otherwise simple questions  What is the management of X, given Y? where "given Y"      is the qualifying condition that makes the question difficult  ; and  3       "Compound" questions asked about the association between two highly specific      elements  Can X cause Y?   The study identified strategies to improve clinical      information retrieval, listed below  CONCLUSION: To improve the chance of finding      answers, physicians should change their search strategies by rephrasing their     questions and searching more clinically oriented resources  Authors of clinical      information resources should anticipate questions that may arise in practice, and      clinical information systems should provide clearer and more explicit answers

PMID- 17356070   - We agree with Weiner, et al that adoption of the term e-Iatrogenesis 1  is both      timely and necessary as we begin to identify what we have called new kinds of      errors 2  resulting from CPOE implementation  The computerization of clinical      information capture with software tools such as CPOE will doubtlessly cause the      emergence of a wide variety of new kinds of errors: e-Iatrogenesis provides a      clear and concise rubric for these unintended and undesired consequences

PMID- 17329734   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the electronic health record  EHR  on cost       i e , payments to providers  and process measures of quality of care  STUDY      DESIGN: Retrospective before-after-study-control  From the database of a large      managed care organization  MCO , we obtained the claims of patients from four     community physician practices that implemented the EHR and from about 50      comparison practices without the EHR in the same counties  The diverse patient      and practice populations were chosen to be a sample more representative of      typical private practices than has previously been studied  MEASUREMENTS: For     four chronic conditions, we used commercially-available software to analyze cost       per episode over a year and the rate of adherence to clinical guidelines as a      measure of quality  RESULTS: The implementation of the EHR had a modest positive       impact on the quality measure of guideline adherence for hypertension and      hyperlipidemia, but no significant impact for diabetes and coronary artery      disease  No measurable impact on the short-term cost per episode was found       Discussions with the study practices revealed that the timing and      comprehensiveness of EHR implementation varied across practices, creating an      intervention variable that was heterogeneous  CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence      increased across practices without EHRs and slightly faster in practices with      EHRs  Measuring the impact of EHRs on cost per episode was challenging, because      of the difficulty of completely capturing the long-term episodic costs of a      chronic condition  Few practices associated with the study MCO had implemented      EHRs in any form, much less utilizing standardized protocols

PMID- 17329732   - The current mechanism for monitoring toxicity symptoms in cancer trials depends      on a complex paper-based process  Electronic collection of patient-reported      outcomes  PROs  may be more efficient and accurate  An online PRO platform was      created including a simple data entry interface, real-time report generation, and      an alert system to e-mail clinicians when patients self-report serious      toxicities  Feasibility assessment involving 180 chemotherapy patients      demonstrated high levels of use at up to 40 follow-up clinic visits per patient      over 16 months  85% of patients at any given visit , with high levels of patient       and clinician acceptance and satisfaction  >95%   Alerts were used as the basis      for delayed chemotherapy treatments, dose modifications, and scheduling changes        These results demonstrate that online patient-reporting is a feasible strategy      for chemotherapy toxicity symptom monitoring, and may improve safety and      satisfaction with care  Ongoing multi-center research will evaluate the impact of      this approach on clinical and administrative outcomes

PMID- 17329730   - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to learn how the editorial staffs of      bioinformatics and medical informatics journals provide support for     cross-community exposure  Models such as co-citation and co-author analysis      measure the relationships between researchers; but they do not capture how      environments that support knowledge transfer across communities are organized       METHODS: In this paper, we propose a social network analysis model to study how      editorial boards integrate researchers from disparate communities  We evaluate      our model by building relational networks based on the editorial boards of      approximately 40 journals that serve as research outlets in medical informatics      and bioinformatics  We track the evolution of editorial relationships through a      longitudinal investigation over the years 2000 through 2005  RESULTS: Our     findings suggest that there are research journals that support the collocation of      editorial board members from the bioinformatics and medical informatics      communities  Network centrality metrics indicate that editorial board members are      located in the intersection of the communities and that the number of individuals      in the intersection is growing with time  CONCLUSIONS: Social network analysis      methods provide insight into the relationships between the medical informatics      and bioinformatics communities  The number of editorial board members      facilitating the publication intersection of the communities has grown, but the      intersection remains dependent on a small group of individuals and fragile

PMID- 17329729   - This article describes the algorithms implemented in the Essie search engine that      is currently serving several Web sites at the National Library of Medicine  Essie      is a phrase-based search engine with term and concept query expansion and      probabilistic relevancy ranking  Essie's design is motivated by an observation      that query terms are often conceptually related to terms in a document, without      actually occurring in the document text  Essie's performance was evaluated using       data and standard evaluation methods from the 2003 and 2006 Text REtrieval      Conference  TREC  Genomics track  Essie was the best-performing search engine in       the 2003 TREC Genomics track and achieved results comparable to those of the      highest-ranking systems on the 2006 TREC Genomics track task  Essie shows that a       judicious combination of exploiting document structure, phrase searching, and      concept based query expansion is a useful approach for information retrieval in      the biomedical domain

PMID- 17329728   - OBJECTIVE: Contemporary error research suggests that the quest to eradicate error     is misguided  Error commission, detection, and recovery are an integral part of      cognitive work, even at the expert level  In collaborative workspaces, the      perception of potential error is directly observable: workers discuss and respond      to perceived violations of accepted practice norms  As perceived violations are      captured and corrected preemptively, they do not fit Reason's widely accepted      definition of error as "failure to achieve an intended outcome " However,      perceived violations suggest the aversion of potential error, and consequently      have implications for error prevention  This research aims to identify and      describe perceived violations of the boundaries of accepted procedure in a      psychiatric emergency department  PED , and how they are resolved in practice       DESIGN: Clinical discourse from fourteen PED patient rounds was audio-recorded       Excerpts from recordings suggesting perceived violations or incidents of      miscommunication were extracted and analyzed using qualitative coding methods       The results are interpreted in relation to prior research on vulnerabilities to      error in the PED  RESULTS: Thirty incidents of perceived violations or     miscommunication are identified and analyzed  Of these, only one medication error     was formally reported  Other incidents would not have been detected by a      retrospective analysis  CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of perceived violations expands      the data available for error analysis beyond occasional reported adverse events        These data are prospective: responses are captured in real time  This analysis      supports a set of recommendations to improve the quality of care in the PED and      other critical care contexts

PMID- 17329727   - The full impact of IT in health care has not been realized because of the failure      to recognize that  1  the path from availability of applications to the      anticipated benefits passes through a series of steps; and  2  progress can be      stopped at any one of those steps  As a result, strategies for diffusion,      adoption, and use have been incomplete and have produced disappointing results       In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for identifying factors that       affect the spread, use, and effects of IT in the U S  health care sector  The      framework can be used by researchers to focus their efforts on unanswered      questions, by practitioners considering IT adoption, and by policymakers      searching for ways to spread IT throughout the system

PMID- 17329726   - OBJECTIVE: Few instruments are available to measure the performance of intensive       care unit  ICU  clinical information systems  Our objectives were: 1  to develop       a survey-based metric that assesses the automation and usability of an ICU's      clinical information system; 2  to determine whether higher scores on this      instrument correlate with improved outcomes in a multi-institution quality      improvement collaborative  DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of the medical      directors of 19 Michigan ICUs participating in a state-wide quality improvement      collaborative designed to reduce the rate of catheter-related blood stream      infections  CRBSI   Respondents completed a survey assessing their ICU's      information systems  MEASUREMENTS: The mean of 54 summed items on this instrument      yields the clinical information technology  CIT  index, a global measure of the      ICU's information system performance on a 100 point scale  The dependent variable      in this study was the rate of CRBSI after the implementation of several      evidence-based recommendations  A multivariable linear regression analysis was      used to examine the relationship between the CIT score and the post-intervention       CRBSI rates after adjustment for the pre-intervention rate  RESULTS: In this      cross-sectional analysis, we found that a 10 point increase in the CIT score is      associated with 4 6 fewer catheter related infections per 1,000 central line days      for ICUs who participate in the quality improvement intervention for 1 year  95%       CI: 1 0 to 8 0   CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a new instrument to examine ICU      information system effectiveness  The results suggest that the presence of more      sophisticated information systems was associated with greater reductions in the      bloodstream infection rate

PMID- 17329725   - OBJECTIVE: Home telemonitoring represents a patient management approach combining      various information technologies for monitoring patients at distance  This study       presents a systematic review of the nature and magnitude of outcomes associated      with telemonitoring of four types of chronic illnesses: pulmonary conditions,      diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases  METHODS: A comprehensive      literature search was conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library to identify      relevant articles published between 1990 and 2006  A total of 65 empirical      studies were obtained  18 pulmonary conditions, 17 diabetes, 16 cardiac diseases,      14 hypertension  mostly conducted in the United States and Europe  RESULTS: The      magnitude and significance of the telemonitoring effects on patients' conditions        e g , early detection of symptoms, decrease in blood pressure, adequate      medication, reduced mortality  still remain inconclusive for all four chronic      illnesses  However, the results of this study suggest that regardless of their     nationality, socioeconomic status, or age, patients comply with telemonitoring      programs and the use of technologies  Importantly, the telemonitoring effects on       clinical effectiveness outcomes  e g , decrease in the emergency visits, hospital      admissions, average hospital length of stay  are more consistent in pulmonary and      cardiac studies than diabetes and hypertension  Lastly, economic viability of      telemonitoring was observed in very few studies and, in most cases, no in-depth      cost-minimization analyses were performed  CONCLUSION: Home telemonitoring of      chronic diseases seems to be a promising patient management approach that      produces accurate and reliable data, empowers patients, influences their     attitudes and behaviors, and potentially improves their medical conditions       Future studies need to build evidence related to its clinical effects, cost      effectiveness, impacts on services utilization, and acceptance by health care      providers

PMID- 17329724   - Concerned about evidence-based health informatics, the authors conducted a      limited pilot survey attempting to determine how many IT evaluation studies in      health care are never published, and why  A survey distributed to 722 academics      had a low response rate, with 136 respondents giving instructive comments on 217       evaluation studies  Of those studies, half were published in international      journals, and more than one-third were never published  Reasons for not      publishing  with multiple reasons per study possible  included: "results not of      interest for others"  1/3 of all studies , "publication in preparation"  1/3 ,      "no time for publication"  1/5 , "limited scientific quality of study"  1/6 ,      "political or legal reasons"  1/7 , and "study only conducted for internal use"       1/8   Those reasons for non-publication in health informatics resembled those      reported in other fields  Publication bias  preference for positive studies  did       not appear to be a major issue  The authors believe that widespread application      of guidelines in conducting health informatics evaluation studies and utilization      of a registry for evaluation study results could improve the evidence base of the      field

PMID- 17329723   - OBJECTIVE: Negation is common in clinical documents and is an important source of      poor precision in automated indexing systems  Previous research has shown that      negated terms may be difficult to identify if the words implying negations       negation signals  are more than a few words away from them  We describe a novel       hybrid approach, combining regular expression matching with grammatical parsing,       to address the above limitation in automatically detecting negations in clinical       radiology reports  DESIGN: Negations are classified based upon the syntactical      categories of negation signals, and negation patterns, using regular expression      matching  Negated terms are then located in parse trees using corresponding      negation grammar  MEASUREMENTS: A classification of negations and their     corresponding syntactical and lexical patterns were developed through manual      inspection of 30 radiology reports and validated on a set of 470 radiology      reports  Another 120 radiology reports were randomly selected as the test set on       which a modified Delphi design was used by four physicians to construct the gold       standard  RESULTS: In the test set of 120 reports, there were a total of 2,976      noun phrases, of which 287 were correctly identified as negated  true positives ,      along with 23 undetected true negations  false negatives  and 4 mistaken      negations  false positives   The hybrid approach identified negated phrases with       sensitivity of 92 6%  95% CI 90 9-93 4% , positive predictive value of 98 6%  95%      CI 96 9-99 4% , and specificity of 99 87%  95% CI 99 7-99 9%   CONCLUSION: This      novel hybrid approach can accurately locate negated concepts in clinical      radiology reports not only when in close proximity to, but also at a distance      from, negation signals

PMID- 17329721   - This paper describes NeuroExtract, a pilot system which facilitates the      integrated retrieval of Internet-based information relevant to the neurosciences       The approach involved extracting descriptive metadata from the sources using      domain-specific queries; retrieving, processing, and organizing the data into      structured text files; searching the data files using text-based queries; and,      providing the results in a Web page along with descriptions to entries and URL      links to the original sources  NeuroExtract has been implemented for three      bioscience resources, SWISSPROT, GEO, and PDB, which provide neuroscience-related      information as sub-topics  We discuss several issues that arose in the course of       NeuroExtract's implementation  This project is a first step in exploring how this      general approach might be used, in conjunction with other query mediation      approaches, to facilitate the integration of many Internet-accessible resources      relevant to the neurosciences

PMID- 17329720   - OBJECTIVE: Although demand for information about the effectiveness and efficiency      of health care information technology grows, large-scale resource-intensive      randomized controlled trials of health care information technology remain      impractical  New methods are needed to translate more commonly available clinical      process measures into potential impact on clinical outcomes  DESIGN: The authors       propose a method for building mathematical models based on published evidence      that provides an evidence bridge between process changes and resulting clinical      outcomes  This method combines tools from systematic review, influence      diagramming, and health care simulations  MEASUREMENTS: The authors apply this      method to create an evidence bridge between retinopathy screening rates and      incidence of blindness in diabetic patients  RESULTS: The resulting model uses      changes in eye examination rates and other evidence-based population parameters      to generate clinical outcomes and costs in a Markov model  CONCLUSION: This      method may serve as an alternative to more expensive study designs and provide      useful estimates of the impact of health care information technology on clinical       outcomes through changes in clinical process measures

PMID- 17213496   - Our goal is to assess how clinical information from previous visits is used in      the emergency department  We used detailed user audit logs to measure access to      different data types  We found that clinician-authored notes and laboratory and      radiology data were used most often  common data types were used up to 5% to 20%       of the time   Data were accessed less than half the time  up to 20% to 50%  even       when the user was alerted to the presence of data  Our access rate indicates that      health information exchange projects should be conservative in estimating how      often shared data will be used and the wide breadth of data accessed indicates      that although a clinical summary is likely to be useful, an ideal solution will      supply a broad variety of data

PMID- 17213494   - OBJECTIVE: Determine effects of computer-based tutoring on diagnostic performance      gains, meta-cognition, and acceptance using two different problem      representations  Describe impact of tutoring on spectrum of diagnostic skills      required for task performance  Identify key features of student-tutor interaction      contributing to learning gains  DESIGN: Prospective, between-subjects study,      controlled for participant level of training  Resident physicians in two academic      pathology programs spent four hours using one of two interfaces which differed      mainly in external problem representation  The case-focused representation      provided an open-learning environment in which students were free to explore      evidence-hypothesis relationships within a case, but could not visualize the      entire diagnostic space  The knowledge-focused representation provided an      interactive representation of the entire diagnostic space, which more tightly      constrained student actions  MEASUREMENTS: Metrics included results of pretest,      post-test and retention-test for multiple choice and case diagnosis tests, ratios      of performance to student reported certainty, results of participant survey,      learning curves, and interaction behaviors during tutoring  RESULTS: Students had      highly significant learning gains after one tutoring session  Learning was      retained at one week  There were no differences between the two interfaces in      learning gains on post-test or retention test  Only students in the      knowledge-focused interface exhibited significant metacognitive gains from      pretest to post-test and pretest to retention test  Students rated the      knowledge-focused interface significantly higher than the case-focused interface       CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive tutoring is associated with improved diagnostic      performance in a complex medical domain  The effect is retained at one-week      post-training  Knowledge-focused external problem representation shows an      advantage over case-focused representation for metacognitive effects and user     acceptance

PMID- 17213492   - OBJECTIVE: Broadly, to create a bidirectional communication link between public      health surveillance and clinical practice  Specifically, to measure the impact of      integrating public health surveillance data into an existing clinical prediction       rule  We incorporate data about recent local trends in meningitis epidemiology      into a prediction model differentiating aseptic from bacterial meningitis  DESIGN      AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of all 696 children with      meningitis admitted to a large urban pediatric hospital from 1992 to 2000  We      modified a published bacterial meningitis score by adding a new epidemiological      context adjustor variable  We examined 540 possible rules for this adjustor,      varying both the number of aseptic meningitis cases that needed to be seen, and      the recent time window in which they were seen  We performed sensitivity analyses      with each of 540 possibilities in order to identify the optimal rule--namely, the      one that included the most cases of aseptic meningitis without missing additional      cases of bacterial meningitis, as compared with the published prediction model       We used bootstrap methods to validate this new score  RESULTS: The optimal rule      was found to be: "at least four cases of aseptic meningitis in the previous 10      days " The epidemiological context adjustor based on surveillance of recent cases      of meningitis allowed the correct identification of an additional 47 cases  7%       of aseptic meningitis without missing any additional cases of bacterial      meningitis  The epidemiological context adjustor was validated, showing      significance in 84% of 1,000 bootstrap samples  CONCLUSION: Epidemiological      contextual information can improve the performance of a clinical prediction rule       We provide a methodological framework for leveraging regional surveillance data      to improve medical decision-making

PMID- 17114640   - Confusion about patients' medication regimens during the hospital admission and      discharge process accounts for many preventable and serious medication errors       Many organizations have begun to redesign their clinical processes to address      this patient safety concern  Partners HealthCare, an integrated delivery network       in Boston, Massachusetts, has answered this interdisciplinary challenge by      leveraging its multiple outpatient electronic medical records  EMR  and inpatient      computerized provider order entry  CPOE  systems to facilitate the process of      medication reconciliation  This manuscript describes the design of a novel      application and the associated services that aggregate medication data from EMR     and CPOE systems so that clinicians can efficiently generate an accurate      pre-admission medication list  Information collected with the use of this      application subsequently supports the writing of admission and discharge orders      by physicians, performance of admission assessment by nurses, and reconciliation       of inpatient orders by pharmacists  Results from early pilot testing suggest that      this new medication reconciliation process is well accepted by clinicians and has      significant potential to prevent medication errors during transitions of care

PMID- 17077453   - Computerized physician order entry  CPOE  is an application that is used to      electronically write physician orders either in the hospital or in the outpatient      setting  It is used in about 15% of U S  Hospitals and a smaller percentage of      ambulatory clinics  It is linked with clinical decision support, which provides      much of the value of implementing it  A number of studies have assessed the      impact of CPOE with respect to a variety of parameters, including costs of care,       medication safety, use of guidelines or protocols, and other measures of the      effectiveness or quality of care  Most of these studies have been undertaken at      CPOE exemplar sites with homegrown clinical information systems  With the      increasing implementation of commercial CPOE systems in various settings of care       has come evidence that some implementation approaches may not achieve previously       published results or may actually cause new errors or even harm  This has lead to      new initiatives to evaluate CPOE systems, which have been undertaken by both      vendors and other groups who evaluate vendors, focused on CPOE vendor     capabilities and effective approaches to implementation that can achieve benefits      seen in published studies  In addition, an electronic health record  EHR  vendor       certification process is ongoing under the province of the Certification      Commission for Health Information Technology  CCHIT   which includes CPOE  that      will affect the purchase and use of these applications by hospitals and clinics      and their participation in public and private health insurance programs  Large      employers have also joined this focus by developing flight simulation tools to      evaluate the capabilities of these CPOE systems once implemented, potentially      linking the results of such programs to reimbursement through pay for performance      programs  The increasing role of CPOE systems in health care has invited much      more scrutiny about the effectiveness of these systems in actual practice which      has the potential to improve their ultimate performance

PMID- 17077452   - Secondary use of health data applies personal health information  PHI  for uses      outside of direct health care delivery  It includes such activities as analysis,       research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider     certification or accreditation, marketing, and other business applications,      including strictly commercial activities  Secondary use of health data can      enhance health care experiences for individuals, expand knowledge about disease      and appropriate treatments, strengthen understanding about effectiveness and      efficiency of health care systems, support public health and security goals, and       aid businesses in meeting customers' needs  Yet, complex ethical, political,      technical, and social issues surround the secondary use of health data  While not      new, these issues play increasingly critical and complex roles given current      public and private sector activities not only expanding health data volume, but      also improving access to data  Lack of coherent policies and standard "good      practices" for secondary use of health data impedes efforts to strengthen the      U S  health care system  The nation requires a framework for the secondary use of      health data with a robust infrastructure of policies, standards, and best      practices  Such a framework can guide and facilitate widespread collection,      storage, aggregation, linkage, and transmission of health data  The framework      will provide appropriate protections for legitimate secondary use

PMID- 17068356   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a model for analysis of chronic disease      prescribing action over time in terms of transitions in status of therapy as      indicated in electronic prescribing records  The quality of alerts derived from      these therapeutic state transitions is assessed in the context of      antihypertensive prescribing  DESIGN: A set of alert criteria is developed based       on analysis of state-transition in past antihypertensive prescribing of a rural      Australian General Practice  Thirty active patients coded as hypertensive with      alerts on six months of previously un-reviewed prescribing, and 30 hypertensive      patients without alerts, are randomly sampled and independently reviewed by the      practice's two main general practice physicians  GPs , each GP reviewing 20 alert      and 20 non-alert cases  providing 10 alert and 10 non-alert cases for agreement      assessment   MEASUREMENTS: GPs provide blind assessment of quality of      hypertension management and retrospective assessment of alert relevance  RESULTS:      Alerts were found on 66 of 611 cases with coded hypertension with 37 alerts on      the 30 sampled alert cases  GPs assessed alerting sensitivity as 74%  CI 52% -      89%  and specificity as 61%  CI 45% - 74%  for the sample, which is estimated as       26% sensitivity and 93% specificity for the antihypertensive population       Agreement between the GPs on assessment of alert relevance was fair  kappa =      0 37   CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven development of alerts from electronic prescribing      records using analysis of therapeutic state transition shows promise for     derivation of high-specificity alerts to improve the quality of chronic disease      management activities

PMID- 17068353   - Bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases such as influenza have spurred      research into rapid outbreak detection  One primary thrust of this research has      been to identify data sources that provide early indication of a disease outbreak      by being leading indicators relative to other established data sources       Researchers tend to rely on the sample cross-correlation function  CCF  to      quantify the association between two data sources  There has been, however,      little consideration by medical informatics researchers of the influence of      methodological choices on the ability of the CCF to identify a lead-lag      relationship between time series  We draw on experience from the econometric and       environmental health communities, and we use simulation to demonstrate that the      sample CCF is highly prone to bias  Specifically, long-scale phenomena tend to      overwhelm the CCF, obscuring phenomena at shorter wave lengths  Researchers      seeking lead-lag relationships in surveillance data must therefore stipulate the       scale length of the features of interest  e g , short-scale spikes versus      long-scale seasonal fluctuations  and then filter the data appropriately--to      diminish the influence of other features, which may mask the features of      interest  Otherwise, conclusions drawn from the sample CCF of bi-variate      time-series data will inevitably be ambiguous and often altogether misleading

PMID- 17068352   - Order sets provide straightforward clinical decision support within computerized       provider order entry systems  They make "the right thing" easier to do because      they are much faster than writing single orders; they deliver real-time,      evidence-based prompts; they are easy to update; and they support coverage of      multiple patient problems through linkages among order sets  This viewpoint paper     discusses controversies surrounding use of order sets--advantages and pitfalls,      decision-making criteria, and organizational considerations, including      suggestions for vendors  Order sets have the potential to improve clinician      efficiency, provide real-time guidance, facilitate compliance with Joint      Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and Centers for Medicare       and Medicaid Services performance measure sets, and encourage overall acceptance       of computerized provider order entry, but may not do so unless these      controversies are addressed

PMID- 17068351   - OBJECTIVE: Despite emerging evidence that electronic health records  EHRs  can      improve the efficiency and quality of medical care, most physicians in office      practice in the United States do not currently use an EHR  We sought to measure      the correlates of EHR adoption  DESIGN: Mailed survey to a stratified random      sample of all medical practices in Massachusetts in 2005, with one physician per       practice randomly selected for survey  MEASUREMENTS: EHR adoption rates  RESULTS:      The response rate was 71%  1345/1884   Overall, while 45% of physicians were      using an EHR, EHRs were present in only 23% of practices  In multivariate      analysis, practice size was strongly correlated with EHR adoption; 52% of      practices with 7 or more physicians had an EHR, as compared with 14% of solo      practices  adjusted odds ratio, 3 66; 95% confidence interval, 2 28-5 87        Hospital-based practices  adjusted odds ratio, 2 44; 95% confidence interval,      1 53-3 91  and practices that teach medical students or residents  adjusted odds       ratio, 2 30; 95% confidence interval, 1 60-3 31  were more likely to have an EHR       The most frequently cited barriers to adoption were start-up financial costs       84% , ongoing financial costs  82% , and loss of productivity  81%        CONCLUSIONS: While almost half of physicians in Massachusetts are using an EHR,      fewer than one in four practices in Massachusetts have adopted EHRs  Adoption      rates are lower in smaller practices, those not affiliated with hospitals, and      those that do not teach medical students or residents  Interventions to expand      EHR use must address both financial and non-financial barriers, especially among       smaller practices

PMID- 17068350   - Data sparsity and schema evolution issues affecting clinical informatics and      bioinformatics communities have led to the adoption of vertical or     object-attribute-value-based database schemas to overcome limitations posed when       using conventional relational database technology  This paper explores these      issues and discusses why biomedical data are difficult to model using      conventional relational techniques  The authors propose a solution to these      obstacles based on a relational database engine using a sparse, column-store      architecture  The authors provide benchmarks comparing the performance of queries      and schema-modification operations using three different strategies:  1  the      standard conventional relational design;  2  past approaches used by biomedical      informatics researchers; and  3  their sparse, column-store architecture  The      performance results show that their architecture is a promising technique for     storing and processing many types of data that are not handled well by the other       two semantic data models

PMID- 17068349   - New reimbursement policies and pay-for-performance programs to reward providers      for producing better outcomes are proliferating  Although electronic health      record  EHR  systems could provide essential clinical data upon which to base      quality measures, most metrics in use were derived from administrative claims      data  We compared commonly used quality measures calculated from administrative      data to those derived from clinical data in an EHR based on a random sample of      125 charts of Medicare patients with diabetes  Using standard definitions based      on administrative data  which require two visits with an encounter diagnosis of      diabetes during the measurement period , only 75% of diabetics determined by      manually reviewing the EHR  the gold standard  were identified  In contrast, 97%       of diabetics were identified using coded information in the EHR  The      discrepancies in identified patients resulted in statistically significant      differences in the quality measures for frequency of HbA1c testing, control of      blood pressure, frequency of testing for urine protein, and frequency of eye      exams for diabetic patients  New development of standardized quality measures      should shift from claims-based measures to clinically based measures that can be       derived from coded information in an EHR  Using data from EHRs will also leverage      their clinical content without adding burden to the care process

PMID- 17068347   - The distinction between authorship and other forms of credit for contribution to       a publication has been a persisting controversy that has resulted in numerous      guidelines outlining the expected contributions of those claiming authorship       While there have been flagrant, well-publicized deviations from widely accepted      standards, they are largely outnumbered by cases that are not publicity-worthy,      and therefore remain known to only those directly involved with the inappropriate      conduct  We discuss the definition and ethical requirements of authorship, offer       a case example of the authorship debate created by a technical tool at our     institution, and review parallels that support and dispute the authorship claims       of our software developers  Ultimately, we conclude that development of a      technical tool that enables data collection does not adequately substitute for     contributions to study design and manuscript preparation for authorship purposes       Unless the designers of such a technical tool prospectively participate as a part      of the project, they would not have an adequate understanding of the      publication's genesis to defend it publicly and cannot be listed as authors       Therefore, it is incumbent upon project members to invite tool developers to      participate at the beginning of such projects, and for tool developers to      contribute to study design and manuscript preparation when they desire authorship      listings

PMID- 17068346   - OBJECTIVES: To assess Veterans Affairs  VA  prescribers' and pharmacists'      opinions about computer-generated drug-drug interaction  DDI  alerts and obtain      suggestions for improving DDI alerts  DESIGN: A mail survey of 725 prescribers      and 142 pharmacists from seven VA medical centers across the United States       MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire asked respondents about their sources of drug and      DDI information, satisfaction with the combined inpatient and outpatient      computerized prescriber order entry  CPOE  system, attitude toward DDI alerts,      and suggestions for improving DDI alerts  RESULTS: The overall response rate was       40%  prescribers: 36%; pharmacists: 59%   Both prescribers and pharmacists      indicated that the CPOE system had a neutral to positive impact on their jobs       DDI alerts were not viewed as a waste of time and the majority  61%  of      prescribers felt that DDI alerts had increased their potential to prescribe      safely  However, only 30% of prescribers felt DDI alerts provided them with what       they needed most of the time  Both prescribers and pharmacists agreed that DDI      alerts should be accompanied by management alternatives  73% and 82%,      respectively  and more detailed information  65% and 89%, respectively   When      asked about suggestions for improving DDI alerts, prescribers most preferred      including management options whereas pharmacists most preferred making it more      difficult to override lethal interactions  Prescribers and pharmacists reported      primarily relying on electronic references for general drug information  62% and       55%, respectively  and DDI information  51% and 79%, respectively   CONCLUSION:      Respondents reported neutral to positive views regarding the effect of CPOE on      their jobs  Their opinions suggest DDI alerts are useful but still require      additional work to increase their clinical utility

PMID- 17068345   - OBJECTIVE: Computerized Provider Order Entry  CPOE  with electronic      documentation, and computerized decision support dramatically changes the      information environment of the practicing clinician  Prior work patterns based on      paper, verbal exchange, and manual methods are replaced with automated,      computerized, and potentially less flexible systems  The objective of this study       is to explore the information management strategies that clinicians use in the      process of adapting to a CPOE system using cognitive task analysis techniques       DESIGN: Observation and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 88      primary-care clinicians at 10 Veterans Administration Medical Centers       MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were taped, transcribed, and extensively analyzed to      identify key information management goals, strategies, and tasks  Tasks were      aggregated into groups, common components across tasks were clarified, and      underlying goals and strategies identified  RESULTS: Nearly half of the      identified tasks were not fully supported by the available technology  Six core      components of tasks were identified  Four meta-cognitive information management      goals emerged: 1  Relevance Screening; 2  Ensuring Accuracy; 3  Minimizing memory      load; and 4  Negotiating Responsibility  Strategies used to support these goals      are presented  CONCLUSION: Users develop a wide array of information management      strategies that allow them to successfully adapt to new technology  Supporting      the ability of users to develop adaptive strategies to support meta-cognitive      goals is a key component of a successful system

PMID- 16929044   - OBJECTIVE: To develop and test an auditing methodology for detecting errors in      medical terminologies satisfying systematic inheritance  This methodology is      based on various abstraction taxonomies that provide high-level views of a      terminology and highlight potentially erroneous concepts  DESIGN: Our auditing      methodology is based on dividing concepts of a terminology into smaller, more      manageable units  First, we divide the terminology's concepts into areas      according to their relationships/roles  Then each multi-rooted area is further     divided into partial-areas  p-areas  that are singly-rooted  Each p-area contains      a set of structurally and semantically uniform concepts  Two kinds of abstraction      networks, called the area taxonomy and p-area taxonomy, are derived  These      taxonomies form the basis for the auditing approach  Taxonomies tend to highlight      potentially erroneous concepts in areas and p-areas  Human reviewers can focus      their auditing efforts on the limited number of problematic concepts following      two hypotheses on the probable concentration of errors  RESULTS: A sample of the       area taxonomy and p-area taxonomy for the Biological Process  BP  hierarchy of      the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus  NCIT  was derived from the application      of our methodology to its concepts  These views led to the detection of a number       of different kinds of errors that are reported, and to confirmation of the      hypotheses on error concentration in this hierarchy  CONCLUSION: Our auditing      methodology based on area and p-area taxonomies is an efficient tool for     detecting errors in terminologies satisfying systematic inheritance of roles, and      thus facilitates their maintenance  This methodology concentrates a domain      expert's manual review on portions of the concepts with a high likelihood of      errors

PMID- 16929043   - This case study examined the utility of regular expressions to identify clinical       data relevant to the epidemiology of treatment of hypertension  We designed a      software tool that employed regular expressions to identify and extract instances      of documented blood pressure values and anti-hypertensive treatment      intensification from the text of physician notes  We determined sensitivity,      specificity and precision of identification of blood pressure values and      anti-hypertensive treatment intensification using a gold standard of manual      abstraction of 600 notes by two independent reviewers  The software processed 370      Mb of text per hour, and identified elevated blood pressure documented in free      text physician notes with sensitivity and specificity of 98%, and precision of      93 2%  Anti-hypertensive treatment intensification was identified with      sensitivity 83 8%, specificity of 95 0%, and precision of 85 9%  Regular     expressions can be an effective method for focused information extraction tasks      related to high-priority disease areas such as hypertension

PMID- 16929042   - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinician-selected electronic information resources      improve primary care physicians' abilities to answer simulated clinical      questions  DESIGN: Observational study using hour-long interviews in physician      offices and think-aloud protocols  PARTICIPANTS: answered 23 multiple-choice      questions and chose 2 to obtain further information using their own information      resources  We established which resources physicians chose, processes used, and      results obtained when looking for information to support their answers       MEASUREMENTS: Correctness of answers before and after searching, resources used,       and searching techniques  RESULTS: 23 physicians sought answers to 46 questions      using their own information resources  They spent a mean of 13 0  SD 5 5  minutes      searching for information for the two questions using an average of 1 8 resources      per question and a wide variety of searching techniques  On average 43 5% of the       answers to the original 23 questions were correct  For the questions that were      searched, 18  39 1%  of the 46 answers were correct before searching  After     searching, the number of correct answers was 19  42 1%   This difference of 1      correct answer was attributed to 6 questions  13 0%  going from an incorrect to      correct answer and 5  10 9%  questions going from a correct to incorrect answer        We found differences in the ability of various resources to provide correct      answers  CONCLUSION: For the primary care physicians studied, electronic      information resources of choice did not always provide support for finding      correct answers to simulated clinical questions and in some instances, individual      resources may have contributed to an initially correct answer becoming incorrect

PMID- 16929041   - OBJECTIVE: Clinicians are increasingly using handheld computers  HC  during      patient care  We sought to assess the role of HC-based clinical reference      software in medical practice by conducting a survey and assessing actual usage      behavior  DESIGN: During a 2-week period in February 2005, 3600 users of a      HC-based clinical reference application were asked by e-mail to complete a survey      and permit analysis of their usage patterns  The software includes a      pharmacopeia, an infectious disease reference, a medical diagnostic and      therapeutic reference and transmits medical alerts and other notifications during      HC synchronizations  Software usage data were captured during HC synchronization       for the 4 weeks prior to survey completion  MEASUREMENTS: Survey responses and      software usage data  RESULTS: The survey response rate was 42%  n = 1501        Physicians reported using the clinical reference software for a mean of 4 years      and 39% reported using the software during more than half of patient encounters        Physicians who synchronized their HC during the data collection period  n = 1249;      83%  used the pharmacopeia for unique drug lookups a mean of 6 3 times per day       SD 12 4   The majority of users  61%  believed that in the prior 4 weeks, use of      the clinical reference prevented adverse drug events or medication errors 3 or     more times  Physicians also believed that alerts and other notifications improved      patient care if they were public health warnings  e g  about influenza , new      immunization guidelines or drug alert warnings  e g  rofecoxib withdrawal        CONCLUSION: Current adopters of HC-based medical references use these tools      frequently, and found them to improve patient care and be valuable in learning of      recent alerts and warnings

PMID- 16929040   - OBJECTIVE: Many Norwegian hospitals that are equipped with an electronic medical       record  EMR  system now have proceeded to withdraw the paper-based medical record      from clinical workflow  In two previous survey-based studies on the effect of      removing the paper-based medical record on the work of physicians, nurses and      medical secretaries, we concluded that to scan and eliminate the paper based      record was feasible, but that the medical secretaries were the group that      reported to benefit the most from the change  To further explore the effects of      removing the paper based record, especially in regard to medical personnel, we      now have conducted a follow up study of a hospital that has scanned and      eliminated its paper-based record  DESIGN: A survey of 27 physicians, 60 nurses      and 30 medical secretaries was conducted  The results were compared with those      from a previous study conducted three years earlier at the same department       MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire  see online Appendix  covered the frequency of      use of the EMR system for specific tasks by physicians, nurses and medical      secretaries, the ease of performing these tasks compared to previous routines,      user satisfaction and computer literacy  RESULTS: Both physicians and nurses      displayed increased use of the EMR compared to the previous study, while medical       secretaries reported generally unchanged but high use  CONCLUSION: The increase      in use was not accompanied by a similar change in factors such as computer     literacy or technical changes, suggesting that these typical success factors are       necessary but not sufficient

PMID- 16929039   - This review describes recent experimental and focus group research on graphics as      a method of communication about quantitative health risks  Some of the studies      discussed in this review assessed effect of graphs on quantitative reasoning,      others assessed effects on behavior or behavioral intentions, and still others      assessed viewers' likes and dislikes  Graphical features that improve the      accuracy of quantitative reasoning appear to differ from the features most likely      to alter behavior or intentions  For example, graphs that make part-to-whole      relationships available visually may help people attend to the relationship      between the numerator  the number of people affected by a hazard  and the      denominator  the entire population at risk , whereas graphs that show only the      numerator appear to inflate the perceived risk and may induce risk-averse      behavior  Viewers often preferred design features such as visual simplicity and      familiarity that were not associated with accurate quantitative judgments       Communicators should not assume that all graphics are more intuitive than text;      many of the studies found that patients' interpretations of the graphics were      dependent upon expertise or instruction  Potentially useful directions for     continuing research include interactions with educational level and numeracy and       successful ways to communicate uncertainty about risk

PMID- 16929038   - OBJECTIVE: Authors developed a picture-graphics display for pulmonary function to      present typical respiratory data used in perioperative and intensive care      environments  The display utilizes color, shape and emergent alerting to      highlight abnormal pulmonary physiology  The display serves as an adjunct to      traditional operating room displays and monitors  DESIGN: To evaluate the      prototype, nineteen clinician volunteers each managed four adverse respiratory      events and one normal event using a high-resolution patient simulator which      included the new displays  intervention subjects  and traditional displays       control subjects   Between-group comparisons included  i  time to diagnosis and       treatment for each adverse respiratory event;  ii  the number of unnecessary      treatments during the normal scenario; and  iii  self-reported workload estimates      while managing study events  MEASUREMENTS: Two expert anesthesiologists reviewed       video-taped transcriptions of the volunteers to determine time to treat and time       to diagnosis  Time values were then compared between groups using a      Mann-Whitney-U Test  Estimated workload for both groups was assessed using the      NASA-TLX and compared between groups using an ANOVA  P-values < 0 05 were      considered significant  RESULTS: Clinician volunteers detected and treated      obstructed endotracheal tubes and intrinsic PEEP problems faster with graphical      rather than conventional displays  p < 0 05   During the normal scenario      simulation, 3 clinicians using the graphical display, and 5 clinicians using the       conventional display gave unnecessary treatments  Clinician-volunteers reported      significantly lower subjective workloads using the graphical display for the      obstructed endotracheal tube scenario  p < 0 001  and the intrinsic PEEP scenario       p < 0 03   CONCLUSION: Authors conclude that the graphical pulmonary display may      serve as a useful adjunct to traditional displays in identifying adverse      respiratory events

PMID- 16929037   - The VeriChip is a Radio-Frequency Identification  RFID  tag produced commercially      for implantation in human beings  Its proposed uses include identification of      medical patients, physical access control, contactless retail payment, and even      the tracing of kidnapping victims  As the authors explain, the VeriChip is      vulnerable to simple, over-the-air spoofing attacks  In particular, an attacker     capable of scanning a VeriChip, eavesdropping on its signal, or simply learning      its serial number can create a spoof device whose radio appearance is      indistinguishable from the original  We explore the practical implications of      this security vulnerability  The authors argue that:1 The VeriChip should serve      exclusively for identification, and not authentication or access control  2      Paradoxically, for bearer safety, a VeriChip should be easy to spoof; an attacker     then has less incentive to coerce victims or extract VeriChips from victims'      bodies

PMID- 16799130   - A risk analysis framework was used to examine the implementation barriers that      may hamper the successful implementation of interorganizational clinical      information systems  ICIS   In terms of study design, an extensive literature      review was first performed in order to elaborate a comprehensive model of project      risk factors  To test the applicability of the model, we next conducted a      longitudinal multiple-case study of two large-scale ICIS demonstration projects      carried out in Quebec, Canada  Variations in the levels of several risk      dimensions measured throughout the duration of the projects were analyzed to      determine their impact on successful implementation  The analysis shows that the       proposed framework, composed of five risk dimensions, was very robust, and      suitable for conducting a thorough risk analysis  The results also show that      there are links between the quality of the risk management and the level of      project outcomes  To be successful, it is important that the implementation      efforts be distributed proportionally according to the importance of each of the       risk factors  Furthermore, because the risks evolve dynamically, there is a need       for high responsiveness to emerging implementation problems  Thus, implementation      success lies in the ability of the project management team to be aware of and to       manage several risk threats simultaneously and coherently since they evolve      dynamically through time and interact with one another

PMID- 16799129   - Nearly all general practice physicians  GPs  in the United Kingdom  UK  have      electronic health record  EHR  systems in their practices compared with perhaps      15% of primary care physicians in the United States  U S    Based on interviews      of 13 general GPs and review of current literature, the authors argue that the      historical experience of widespread electronic health record uptake in the UK      provides insight into features that might motivate broad adoption in the United      States  These features include electronic prescribing, improved quality and      consistency of care, practice efficiencies that have both timesaving and revenue       generating effects, and potential shielding from malpractice claims

PMID- 16799127   - OBJECTIVE: Acquiring and representing biomedical knowledge is an increasingly      important component of contemporary bioinformatics  A critical step of the      process is to identify and retrieve relevant documents among the vast volume of      modern biomedical literature efficiently  In the real world, many information      retrieval tasks are difficult because of high data dimensionality and the lack of      annotated examples to train a retrieval algorithm  Under such a scenario, the      performance of information retrieval algorithms is often unsatisfactory,      therefore improvements are needed  DESIGN: We studied two approaches that enhance      the text categorization performance on sparse and high data dimensionality:  1       semantic-preserving dimension reduction by representing text with      semantic-enriched features; and  2  augmenting training data with semi-supervised      learning  A probabilistic topic model was applied to extract major semantic      topics from a corpus of text of interest  The representation of documents was      projected from the high-dimensional vocabulary space onto a semantic topic space       with reduced dimensionality  A semi-supervised learning algorithm based on graph       theory was applied to identify potential positive training cases, which were      further used to augment training data  The effects of data transformation and      augmentation on text categorization by support vector machine  SVM  were      evaluated  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Semantic-enriched data transformation and the       pseudo-positive-cases augmented training data enhance the efficiency and      performance of text categorization by SVM

PMID- 16799125   - OBJECTIVE: Human classification of diagnoses is a labor intensive process that      consumes significant resources  Most medical practices use specially trained      medical coders to categorize diagnoses for billing and research purposes       METHODS: We have developed an automated coding system designed to assign codes to      clinical diagnoses  The system uses the notion of certainty to recommend      subsequent processing  Codes with the highest certainty are generated by matching      the diagnostic text to frequent examples in a database of 22 million manually      coded entries  These code assignments are not subject to subsequent manual      review  Codes at a lower certainty level are assigned by matching to previously      infrequently coded examples  The least certain codes are generated by a naive      Bayes classifier  The latter two types of codes are subsequently manually      reviewed  MEASUREMENTS: Standard information retrieval accuracy measurements of      precision, recall and f-measure were used  Micro- and macro-averaged results were      computed  RESULTS At least 48% of all EMR problem list entries at the Mayo Clinic      can be automatically classified with macro-averaged 98 0% precision, 98 3% recall      and an f-score of 98 2%  An additional 34% of the entries are classified with      macro-averaged 90 1% precision, 95 6% recall and 93 1% f-score  The remaining 18%      of the entries are classified with macro-averaged 58 5%  CONCLUSION: Over two      thirds of all diagnoses are coded automatically with high accuracy  The system      has been successfully implemented at the Mayo Clinic, which resulted in a      reduction of staff engaged in manual coding from thirty-four coders to seven      verifiers

PMID- 16799124   - OBJECTIVE: Develop and analyze results from an image retrieval test collection       METHODS: After participating research groups obtained and assessed results from      their systems in the image retrieval task of Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, we       assessed the results for common themes and trends  In addition to overall      performance, results were analyzed on the basis of topic categories  those most      amenable to visual, textual, or mixed approaches  and run categories  those      employing queries entered by automated or manual means as well as those using      visual, textual, or mixed indexing and retrieval methods   We also assessed      results on the different topics and compared the impact of duplicate relevance      judgments  RESULTS: A total of 13 research groups participated  Analysis was      limited to the best run submitted by each group in each run category  The best      results were obtained by systems that combined visual and textual methods  There       was substantial variation in performance across topics  Systems employing textual      methods were more resilient to visually oriented topics than those using visual      methods were to textually oriented topics  The primary performance measure of      mean average precision  MAP  was not necessarily associated with other measures,       including those possibly more pertinent to real users, such as precision at 10 or     30 images  CONCLUSIONS: We developed a test collection amenable to assessing      visual and textual methods for image retrieval  Future work must focus on how      varying topic and run types affect retrieval performance  Users' studies also are      necessary to determine the best measures for evaluating the efficacy of image      retrieval systems

PMID- 16799123   - The authors evaluated the retrieval power of PubMed "Clinical Queries," narrow      search string, about therapy in comparison with a modified search string to avoid      possible retrieval bias  PubMed search strategy was compared to a slightly      modified string that included the Britannic English term "randomised " The      authors tested the two strings joined onto each of four terms concerning topics      of broad interest: hypertension, hepatitis, diabetes, and heart failure  In      particular, precision was computed for not-indexed citations  The added word      "randomised" improved total citation retrieval in any case  Total retrieval gain       for not-indexed citations ranged from 11 1% to 21 4%  A significant number of      Randomized Controlled Trial s   RCT s  9 1-18 2%  was retrieved for each of the      selected topics  They were often recently published RCTs  The authors think that       correction of the Clinical Queries filter  when they focus on therapy and use      narrow searches  is necessary to avoid biased search results with loss of      relevant and up-to-date scientifically sound information

PMID- 16799122   - OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing  NLP  approaches have been explored to      manage and mine information recorded in biological literature  A critical step      for biological literature mining is biological named entity tagging  BNET  that      identifies names mentioned in text and normalizes them with entries in biological      databases  The aim of this study was to provide quantitative assessment of the      complexity of BNET on protein entities through BioThesaurus, a thesaurus of      gene/protein names for UniProt knowledgebase  UniProtKB  entries that was      acquired using online resources  METHODS: We evaluated the complexity through      several perspectives: ambiguity  i e , the number of genes/proteins represented      by one name , synonymy  i e , the number of names associated with the same      gene/protein , and coverage  i e , the percentage of gene/protein names in text      included in the thesaurus   We also normalized names in BioThesaurus and measures      were obtained twice, once before normalization and once after  RESULTS: The      current version of BioThesaurus has over 2 6 million names or 2 1 million      normalized names covering more than 1 8 million UniProtKB entries  The average      synonymy is 3 53  2 86 after normalization , ambiguity is 2 31 before      normalization and 2 32 after, while the coverage is 94 0% based on the      BioCreAtive data set comprising MEDLINE abstracts containing genes/proteins       CONCLUSION: The study indicated that names for genes/proteins are highly      ambiguous and there are usually multiple names for the same gene or protein  It      also demonstrated that most gene/protein names appearing in text can be found in       BioThesaurus

PMID- 16799121   - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the coverage provided by SNOMED CT for clinical research      concepts represented by the items on case report forms  CRFs , as well as the      semantic nature of those concepts relevant to post-coordination methods  DESIGN:       Convenience samples from CRFs developed by rheumatologists conducting several      longitudinal, observational studies of vasculitis were selected  A total of 17      CRFs were used as the basis of analysis for this study, from which a total set of      616  unique  items were identified  Each unique data item was classified as      either a clinical finding or procedure  The items were coded by the presence and       nature of SNOMED CT coverage and classified into semantic types by 2 coders       MEASUREMENTS: Basic frequency analysis was conducted to determine levels of      coverage provided by SNOMED CT  Estimates of coverage by various semantic      characterizations were estimated  RESULTS: Most of the core clinical concepts       88%  from these clinical research data items were covered by SNOMED CT; however,      far fewer of the concepts were fully covered  that is, where all aspects of the      CRF item could be represented completely without post-coordination; 23%   In      addition, a large majority of the concepts  83%  required post-coordination,      either to clarify context  e g , time  or to better capture complex clinical      concepts  e g , disease-related findings   For just over one third of the sampled      CRF data items, both types of post-coordination were necessary to fully represent      the meaning of the item  CONCLUSION: SNOMED CT appears well-suited for     representing a variety of clinical concepts, yet is less suited for representing       the full amount of information collected on CRFs

PMID- 16799119   - Physician leadership is a critical success factor for health information      technology initiatives, but best practices for structuring the role and skills      required for such leadership remain undefined  The authors conducted structured      interviews with five physician information technology leaders, or Chief Medical      Information Officers  CMIOs , at health systems that broadly used health      information technology  The study aimed to identify the individual skills and      organizational structure necessary for a CMIO to be effective  The interviews      found that the CMIOs had significant management experience prior to serving as a       CMIO and were positioned and supported within each health system similar to other     executive leaders; only one of the five CMIOs had formal informatics training  A       review of the findings advocates for the CMIO to have a strong background and      role as a physician executive supported by knowledge in informatics, as opposed      to being a highly trained informaticist with secondary management expertise or     support

PMID- 16622171   - OBJECTIVE: Computerized physician order entry with clinical decision support has       been shown to improve medication safety in adult inpatients, but few data are      available regarding its usefulness in the long-term care setting  The objective      of this study was to examine opportunities for improving medication safety in      that clinical setting by determining the proportion of medication orders that      would generate a warning message to the prescriber via a computerized clinical      decision support system and assessing the extent to which these alerts would      affect prescribers' actions  DESIGN: The study was set within a randomized      controlled trial of computerized clinical decision support conducted in the      long-stay units of a large, academically-affiliated long-term care facility  In      March 2002, a computer-based clinical decision support system  CDSS  was added to      an existing computerized physician order entry  CPOE  system  Over a subsequent      one-year study period, prescribers ordering drugs for residents on three      resident-care units of the facility were presented with alerts; these alerts were      not displayed to prescribers in the four control units  MEASUREMENTS: We assessed      the frequency of drug orders associated with various categories of alerts across       all participating units of the facility  To assess the impact of actually      receiving an alert on prescriber behavior during drug ordering, we calculated      separately for the intervention and control units the proportion of the alerts,      within each category, that were followed by an appropriate action and estimated      the relative risk of an appropriate action in the intervention units compared to       the control units  RESULTS: During the 12 months of the study, there were 445      residents on the participating units of the facility, contributing 3,726      resident-months of observation time  During this period, 47,997 medication orders      were entered through the CPOE system-approximately 9 medication orders per     resident per month  9,414 alerts were triggered  2 5 alerts per resident-month         The alert categories most often triggered were related to risks of central      nervous system side-effects such as over-sedation  20%   Alerts for risk of      drug-associated constipation  13%  or renal insufficiency/electrolyte imbalance       12%  were also common  Twelve percent of the alerts were related to orders for     warfarin  Overall, prescribers who received alerts were only slightly more likely      to take an appropriate action  relative risk 1 11, 95% confidence interval 1 00,       1 22   Alerts related to orders for warfarin or central nervous system side      effects were most likely to engender an appropriate action, such as ordering a      recommended laboratory test or canceling an ordered drug  CONCLUSION: Long-term      care facilities must implement new system-level approaches with the potential to       improve medication safety for their residents  The number of medication orders      that triggered a warning message in this study suggests that CPOE with a clinical      decision support system may represent one such tool  However, the relatively low       rate of response to these alerts suggests that further refinements to such      systems are required, and that their impact on medication errors and adverse drug      events must be carefully assessed

PMID- 16622166   - The literature of home telehealth technology recommends that systems be designed       to minimize their obtrusiveness to end users  However, this term is neither     explicitly defined nor consistently used  This paper presents a definition of the      concept of obtrusiveness  Within this definition, twenty-two categories of what      may be perceived as obtrusive in home telehealth technology are proposed based on      a review of the literature  These categories are grouped into eight dimensions       This effort represents an initial step toward developing measures of      obtrusiveness associated with home telehealth technology  A validated and      reliable instrument would allow for evaluation of individual applications as well      as theory-building across applications

PMID- 16622165   - OBJECTIVE: The present study explores the discriminatory performance of existing       and novel gold-standard-specific machine learning  GSS-ML  focused filter models        i e , models built specifically for a retrieval task and a gold standard against      which they are evaluated  and compares their performance to citation count and      impact factors, and non-specific machine learning  NS-ML  models  i e , models      built for a different task and/or different gold standard   DESIGN: Three gold      standard corpora were constructed using the SSOAB bibliography, the ACPJ-cited      treatment articles, and the ACPJ-cited etiology articles  Citation counts and      impact factors were obtained for each article  Support vector machine models were      used to classify the articles using combinations of content, impact factors, and       citation counts as predictors  MEASUREMENTS: Discriminatory performance was      estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and      n-fold cross-validation  RESULTS: For all three gold standards and tasks, GSS-ML       filters outperformed citation count, impact factors, and NS-ML filters       Combinations of content with impact factor or citation count produced no or     negligible improvements to the GSS machine learning filters  CONCLUSIONS: These      experiments provide evidence that when building information retrieval filters      focused on a retrieval task and corresponding gold standard, the filter models      have to be built specifically for this task and gold standard  Under those      conditions, machine learning filters outperform standard citation metrics       Furthermore, citation counts and impact factors add marginal value to      discriminatory performance  Previous research that claimed better performance of       citation metrics than machine learning in one of the corpora examined here is      attributed to using machine learning filters built for a different gold standard       and task

PMID- 16622162   - OBJECTIVE: Many hospitals utilize antimicrobial management teams  AMTs  to      improve patient care  However, most function with minimal computer support  We      evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a computerized clinical      decision support system for the management of antimicrobial utilization  DESIGN:       A randomized controlled trial in adult inpatients between May 10 and August 3,      2004  Antimicrobial utilization was managed by an existing AMT using the system      in the intervention arm and without the system in the control arm  The system was      developed to alert the AMT of potentially inadequate antimicrobial therapy       MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes assessed were hospital antimicrobial expenditures,      mortality, length of hospitalization, and time spent managing antimicrobial      utilization  RESULTS: The AMT intervened on 359  16%  of 2,237 patients in the      intervention arm and 180  8%  of 2,270 in the control arm, while spending      approximately one hour less each day on the intervention arm  Hospital      antimicrobial expenditures were $285,812 in the intervention arm and $370,006 in       the control arm, for a savings of $84,194  23% , or $37 64 per patient  No      significant difference was observed in mortality  3 26% vs  2 95%, p = 0 55  or     length of hospitalization  3 84 vs  3 99 days, p = 0 38   CONCLUSION: Use of the       system facilitated the management of antimicrobial utilization by allowing the      AMT to intervene on more patients receiving inadequate antimicrobial therapy and       to achieve substantial time and cost savings for the hospital  This is the first       study that demonstrates in a patient-randomized controlled trial that      computerized clinical decision support systems can improve existing antimicrobial      management programs

PMID- 16622161   - There is a critical gap in our nation's ability to accurately measure and manage       the quality of medical care  A robust healthcare quality information system       HQIS  has the potential to address this deficiency through the capture,      codification, and analysis of information about patient treatments and related      outcomes  Because non-technical issues often present the greatest challenges,      this paper provides an overview of these socio-technical issues in building a      successful HQIS, including the human, organizational, and knowledge management       KM  perspectives  Through an extensive literature review and direct experience      in building a practical HQIS  the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Outcomes       Research Database system , we have formulated an "informatics blueprint" to guide      the development of such systems  While the blueprint was developed to facilitate       healthcare quality information collection, management, analysis, and reporting,      the concepts and advice provided may be extensible to the development of other     types of clinical research information systems

PMID- 16622159   - OBJECTIVES: To compare the rates and nature of ADEs at an academic medical center     and a community hospital using a single computerized ADE surveillance system       DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of patients admitted to two tertiary care      hospitals  Outcome Measure Adverse drug events identified by automated      surveillance and voluntary reporting  METHODS: We implemented an automated      surveillance system across an academic medical center and a community hospital       Potential events identified by the computer were reviewed in detail by medication      safety pharmacists and scored for causality and severity  Findings were compared       between the two hospitals, and with voluntary reports from nurses and      pharmacists  RESULTS: Over the 8 month study period, 25,177 patients were      admitted to the university hospital and 8,029 to the community hospital  There      were 1,116 ADEs in 900 patients at the university hospital for an overall rate of      4 4 ADEs per 100 admissions  At the community hospital, 399 patients experienced       501 ADEs for a rate of 6 2 events per 100 admissions  Rates of      antibiotic-associated colitis, drug-induced hypoglycemia, and      anticoagulation-related ADEs were significantly higher at the community hospital       compared with the university hospital  Computerized surveillance detected ADEs at      a rate 3 6 times that of voluntary reporting at the university hospital and 12 3       times that at the community hospital  CONCLUSIONS: Operation of a common      automated ADE surveillance system across hospitals permits meaningful comparison       of ADE rates in different inpatient settings  Automated surveillance detects ADEs      at rates far higher than voluntary reporting, and the difference may be greater     in the community hospital setting  Community hospitals may experience higher     rates of certain types of ADEs compared with academic medical centers

PMID- 16501186   - OBJECTIVE: To automate the mapping of disparate databases to standardized medical      vocabularies  Background: Merging of clinical systems and medical databases, or     aggregation of information from disparate databases, frequently requires a      process whereby vocabularies are compared and similar concepts are mapped       DESIGN: Using a normalization phase followed by a novel alignment stage inspired       by DNA sequence alignment methods, automated lexical mapping can map terms from      various databases to standard vocabularies such as the UMLS  Unified Medical      Language System  and LOINC  Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes        MEASUREMENTS: This automated lexical mapping was evaluated using three real-world      laboratory databases from different health care institutions  The authors report       the sensitivity, specificity, percentage correct  true positives plus true      negatives divided by total number of terms , and true positive and true negative       rates as measures of system performance  RESULTS: The alignment algorithm was      able to map 57% to 78%  average of 63% over all runs and databases  of equivalent      concepts through lexical mapping alone  True positive rates ranged from 18% to      70%; true negative rates ranged from 5% to 52%  CONCLUSION: Lexical mapping can      facilitate the integration of data from diverse sources and decrease the time and      cost required for manual mapping and integration of clinical systems and medical       databases

PMID- 16501184   - OBJECTIVE: The development and application of data-driven decision-support      systems for medical triage, diagnostics, and prognostics pose special      requirements on physiologic data  In particular, that data are reliable in order       to produce meaningful results  The authors describe a method that automatically      estimates the reliability of reference heart rates  HRr  derived from      electrocardiogram  ECG  waveforms and photoplethysmogram  PPG  waveforms recorded      by vital-signs monitors  The reliability is quantitatively expressed through a      quality index  QI  for each HRr  DESIGN: The proposed method estimates the      reliability of heart rates from vital-signs monitors by  1  assessing the quality      of the ECG and PPG waveforms,  2  separately computing heart rates from these      waveforms, and  3  concisely combining this information into a QI that considers       the physical redundancy of the signal sources and independence of heart rate      calculations  The assessment of the waveforms is performed by a Support Vector     Machine classifier and the independent computation of heart rate from the      waveforms is performed by an adaptive peak identification technique, termed      ADAPIT, which is designed to filter out motion-induced noise  RESULTS: The      authors evaluated the method against 158 randomly selected data samples of trauma      patients collected during helicopter transport, each sample consisting of      7-second ECG and PPG waveform segments and their associated HRr  They compared      the results of the algorithm against manual analysis performed by human experts      and found that in 92% of the cases, the algorithm either matches or is more      conservative than the human's QI qualification  In the remaining 8% of the cases,      the algorithm infers a less conservative QI, though in most cases this was      because of algorithm/human disagreement over ambiguous waveform quality  If these      ambiguous waveforms were relabeled, the misclassification rate would drop from 8%      to 3%  CONCLUSION: This method provides a robust approach for automatically      assessing the reliability of large quantities of heart rate data and the      waveforms from which they are derived

PMID- 16501182   - Electronic health record  EHR  systems are increasingly being adopted in      pediatric practices; however, requirements for integrated growth charts are      poorly described and are not standardized in current systems  The authors      integrated growth chart functionality into an EHR system being developed and      installed in a multispecialty pediatric clinic in an academic medical center       During a three-year observation period, rates of electronically documented values      for weight, stature, and head circumference increased from fewer than ten total      per weekday, up to 488 weight values, 293 stature values, and 74 head      circumference values  p<0 001 for each measure   By the end of the observation      period, users accessed the growth charts an average 175 times per weekday,      compared to 127 patient visits per weekday to the sites that most closely      monitored pediatric growth  Because EHR systems and integrated growth charts can       manipulate data, perform calculations, and adapt to user preferences and patient       characteristics, users may expect greater functionality from electronic growth      charts than from paper-based growth charts

PMID- 16501181   - Previous investigators have defined clinical interface terminology as a      systematic collection of health care-related phrases  terms  that supports      clinicians' entry of patient-related information into computer programs, such as       clinical "note capture" and decision support tools  Interface terminologies also       can facilitate display of computer-stored patient information to clinician-users       Interface terminologies "interface" between clinicians' own unfettered,      colloquial conceptualizations of patient descriptors and the more structured,      coded internal data elements used by specific health care application programs       The intended uses of a terminology determine its conceptual underpinnings,      structure, and content  As a result, the desiderata for interface terminologies      differ from desiderata for health care-related terminologies used for storage       e g , SNOMED-CT , information retrieval  e g , MeSH , and classification  e g ,       ICD9-CM   Necessary but not sufficient attributes for an interface terminology      include adequate synonym coverage, presence of relevant assertional knowledge,      and a balance between pre- and post-coordination  To place interface      terminologies in context, this article reviews historical goals and challenges of      clinical terminology development in general and then focuses on the unique      features of interface terminologies

PMID- 16501180   - Health care provides many opportunities in which the sharing of data between      independent sites is highly desirable  Several standards are required to produce       the functional and semantic interoperability necessary to support the exchange of      such data: a common reference information model, a common set of data elements, a      common terminology, common data structures, and a common transport standard  This      paper addresses one component of that set of standards: the ability to create a      document that supports the exchange of structured data components  Unfortunately,      two different standards development organizations have produced similar standards      for that purpose based on different information models: Health Level 7  HL7 's      Clinical Document Architecture  CDA  and The American Society for Testing and      Materials  ASTM International  Continuity of Care Record  CCR   The coexistence      of both standards might require mapping from one standard to the other, which      could be accompanied by a loss of information and functionality  This paper     examines and compares the two standards, emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses       of each, and proposes a strategy of harmonization to enhance future progress       While some of the authors are members of HL7 and/or ASTM International, the      authors stress that the viewpoints represented in this paper are those of the      authors and do not represent the official viewpoints of either HL7 or of ASTM      International

PMID- 16501179   - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated an existing SNOMED-CT model for structured      recording of heart murmur findings and compared it to a concept-dependent      attributes model using content from SNOMED-CT  METHODS: The authors developed a      model for recording heart murmur findings as an alternative to SNOMED-CT's use of      Interprets and Has interpretation  A micro-nomenclature was then created to      support each model using subset and extension mechanisms described for SNOMED-CT       Each micro-nomenclature included a partonomy of cardiac cycle timing values  A      mechanism for handling ranges of values was also devised  One hundred clinical      heart murmurs were recorded using purpose-built recording software based on both       models  RESULTS: Each micro-nomenclature was extended through the addition of the      same list of concepts  SNOMED role grouping was required in both models  All 100       clinical murmurs were described using each model  The only major differences      between the two models were the number of relationship rows required for storage       and the hierarchical assignments of concepts within the micro-nomenclatures       CONCLUSION: The authors were able to capture 100 clinical heart murmurs with both      models  Requirements for implementing the two models were virtually identical  In      fact, data stored using these models could be easily interconverted  There is no       apparent penalty for implementing either approach

PMID- 16357360   - OBJECTIVE: In the context of an inpatient care provider order entry  CPOE       system, to evaluate the impact of a decision support tool on integration of      cardiology "best of care" order sets into clinicians' admission workflow, and on       quality measures for the management of acute myocardial infarction  AMI       patients  DESIGN: A before-and-after study of physician orders evaluated  1       per-patient use rates of standardized acute coronary syndrome  ACS  order set and       2  patient-level compliance with two individual recommendations: early aspirin      ordering and beta-blocker ordering  MEASUREMENTS: The effectiveness of the      intervention was evaluated for  1  all patients with ACS  suspected for AMI at      the time of admission   N = 540  and  2  the subset of the ACS patients with      confirmed discharge diagnosis of AMI  n = 180  who comprise the recommended      target population who should receive aspirin and/or beta-blockers  Compliance      rates for use of the ACS order set, aspirin ordering, and beta-blocker ordering      were calculated as the percentages of patients who had each action performed      within 24 hours of admission  RESULTS: For all ACS admissions, the decision      support tool significantly increased use of the ACS order set  p = 0 009   Use of      the ACS order set led, within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, to a      significant increase in the number of patients who received aspirin  p = 0 001       and a nonsignificant increase in the number of patients who received      beta-blockers  p = 0 07   Results for confirmed AMI cases demonstrated similar     increases, but did not reach statistical significance  CONCLUSION: The decision      support tool increased optional use of the ACS order set, but room for additional      improvement exists

PMID- 16357359   - This paper illustrates the use of biometrics through the application of an      iris-based biometrics system for identifying twins and their parents in a      longitudinal research study  It explores the use of biometrics  science of      measuring physical or anatomical characteristics of individuals  as a technology       for correct identification of individuals during longitudinal studies to help      ensure data fidelity  Examples of these circumstances include longitudinal      epidemiological and genetic studies, clinical trials, and multicenter     collaborative studies where accurate identification of subjects over time can be       difficult when the subject may be young or an unreliable source of identification      information  The use of technology can automate the process of subject      identification thereby reducing the need to depend on subject recall during      repeated visits thus helping to ensure data quality  This case report provides      insights that may serve as useful hints for those responsible for planning system      implementation that involves participants' authentication that would require a      more secure form of identification

PMID- 16357358   - Many computerized physician order entry  CPOE  systems have integrated drug      safety alerts  The authors reviewed the literature on physician response to drug       safety alerts and interpreted the results using Reason's framework of accident      causation  In total, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria  Drug safety alerts are      overridden by clinicians in 49% to 96% of cases  Alert overriding may often be      justified and adverse drug events due to overridden alerts are not always      preventable  A distinction between appropriate and useful alerts should be made        The alerting system may contain error-producing conditions like low specificity,       low sensitivity, unclear information content, unnecessary workflow disruptions,      and unsafe and inefficient handling  These may result in active failures of the      physician, like ignoring alerts, misinterpretation, and incorrect handling       Efforts to improve patient safety by increasing correct handling of drug safety      alerts should focus on the error-producing conditions in software and      organization  Studies on cognitive processes playing a role in overriding drug      safety alerts are lacking

PMID- 16357357   - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate the acceptability and use of an integrated      electronic prescribing and drug management system  MOXXI  for primary care      physicians  DESIGN: A 20-month follow-up study of MOXXI  Medical Office of the      XXIst Century  implementation in 28 primary care physicians and 13,515 consenting      patients  MEASUREMENT: MOXXI was developed to enhance patient safety by      integrating patient demographics, retrieving active drugs from pharmacy systems,       generating an automated problem list, and providing electronic prescription, stop      order, automated prescribing problem alerts, and compliance monitoring functions       Evaluation of technical performance, acceptability, and use was conducted using      audit trails, questionnaires, standardized tasks, and information from      comprehensive health insurance databases  RESULTS: Perceived improvements in      continuity of care and professional autonomy were associated with physicians'      expected use of MOXXI  Physician speed in using MOXXI improved substantially in      the first three months; however, only the represcribing function was faster using      MOXXI than by handwritten prescription  Physicians wrote electronic prescriptions      in 36 9 per 100 visits and reviewed the patient's drug profile in 12 6 per 100      visits  Physicians rated printed prescriptions, the current drug list, and the      represcribing function as the most beneficial aspects of the system  Physicians      were more likely to use the drug profile for patients who used more medication,      made more emergency department visits, had more prescribing physicians, and lower     continuity of care  CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians believed an integrated      electronic prescribing and drug management system would improve continuity of      care, and they were more likely to use the system for patients with more complex,      fragmented care

PMID- 16357356   - OBJECTIVE: A variety of postmarketing surveillance strategies to monitor the      safety of medical devices have been supported by the U S  Food and Drug      Administration, but there are few systems to automate surveillance  Our objective      was to develop a system to perform real-time monitoring of safety data using a      variety of process control techniques  DESIGN: The Web-based Data Extraction and       Longitudinal Time Analysis  DELTA  system imports clinical data in real-time from      an electronic database and generates alerts for potentially unsafe devices or     procedures  The statistical techniques used are statistical process control       SPC , logistic regression  LR , and Bayesian updating statistics  BUS        MEASUREMENTS: We selected in-patient mortality following implantation of the      Cypher drug-eluting coronary stent to evaluate our system  Data from the      University of Michigan Consortium Bare-Metal Stent Study was used to calculate      the event rate alerting boundaries  Data analysis was performed on local      catheterization data from Brigham and Women's Hospital from July 1, 2003, shortly      after the Cypher release, to December 31, 2004, including 2,270 cases with 27      observed deaths  RESULTS: The single-stratum SPC had alerts in months 4 and 10       The multistrata SPC had alerts in months 5, 10, and 18 in the moderate-risk      stratum, and months 1, 4, 7, and 10 in the high-risk stratum  The only cumulative      alerts were in the first month for the high-risk stratum of the multistrata SPC        The LR method showed no monthly or cumulative alerts  The BUS method showed an      alert in the first month for the high-risk stratum  CONCLUSION: The system      performed adequately within the Brigham and Women's Hospital Intranet environment      based on the design goals  All three cumulative methods agreed that the overall      observed event rates were not significantly higher for the new medical device      than for a closely related medical device and were consistent with the      observation that the initial concerns about this device dissipated as more data      accumulated

PMID- 16357355   - OBJECTIVE: The idea of testing a hypothesis is central to the practice of      biomedical research  However, the results of testing a hypothesis are published      mainly in the form of prose articles  Encoding the results as scientific      assertions that are both human and machine readable would greatly enhance the      synergistic growth and dissemination of knowledge  DESIGN: We have developed      MachineProse  MP , an ontological framework for the concise specification of      scientific assertions  MP is based on the idea of an assertion constituting a      fundamental unit of knowledge  This is in contrast to current approaches that use      discrete concept terms from domain ontologies for annotation and assertions are      only inferred heuristically  MEASUREMENTS: We use illustrative examples to      highlight the advantages of MP over the use of the Medical Subject Headings       MeSH  system and keywords in indexing scientific articles  RESULTS: We show how       MP makes it possible to carry out semantic annotation of publications that is      machine readable and allows for precise search capabilities  In addition, when      used by itself, MP serves as a knowledge repository for emerging discoveries  A      prototype for proof of concept has been developed that demonstrates the      feasibility and novel benefits of MP  As part of the MP framework, we have      created an ontology of relationship types with about 100 terms optimized for the       representation of scientific assertions  CONCLUSION: MachineProse is a novel      semantic framework that we believe may be used to summarize research findings,      annotate biomedical publications, and support sophisticated searches

PMID- 16357354   - The beginning of the 21st century has seen a surge in interest and enthusiasm for     health care information technology based on its ability to demonstrate      improvements in the quality, safety, and cost-efficiency of health care  One      question, however, for which we have fewer answers is "who will be the      individuals that develop, implement, and evaluate these systems?" In particular,       while most attention has been paid to the exemplar leaders in health information       technology, less has been focused on the issue of the workforce necessary to      sustain the systems to achieve their vision  The discipline of medical      informatics must pay sufficient attention to the professional workforce that will      deploy systems outside the informatics research setting so their benefits may      more widely accrue

PMID- 16357353   - OBJECTIVE: The use of spatially based methods and algorithms in epidemiology and       surveillance presents privacy challenges for researchers and public health      agencies  We describe a novel method for anonymizing individuals in public health      data sets by transposing their spatial locations through a process informed by      the underlying population density  Further, we measure the impact of the skew on       detection of spatial clustering as measured by a spatial scanning statistic       DESIGN: Cases were emergency department  ED  visits for respiratory illness       Baseline ED visit data were injected with artificially created clusters ranging      in magnitude, shape, and location  The geocoded locations were then transformed      using a de-identification algorithm that accounts for the local underlying      population density  MEASUREMENTS: A total of 12,600 separate weeks of case data      with artificially created clusters were combined with control data and the impact      on detection of spatial clustering identified by a spatial scan statistic was      measured  RESULTS: The anonymization algorithm produced an expected skew of cases      that resulted in high values of data set k-anonymity  De-identification that      moves points an average distance of 0 25 km lowers the spatial cluster detection       sensitivity by less than 4% and lowers the detection specificity less than 1%       CONCLUSION: A population-density-based Gaussian spatial blurring markedly      decreases the ability to identify individuals in a data set while only slightly      decreasing the performance of a standardly used outbreak detection tool  These      findings suggest new approaches to anonymizing data for spatial epidemiology and       surveillance

PMID- 16357352   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether automated classification of document citations      can be useful in reducing the time spent by experts reviewing journal articles      for inclusion in updating systematic reviews of drug class efficacy for treatment      of disease  DESIGN: A test collection was built using the annotated reference      files from 15 systematic drug class reviews  A voting perceptron-based automated       citation classification system was constructed to classify each article as      containing high-quality, drug class-specific evidence or not  Cross-validation      experiments were performed to evaluate performance  MEASUREMENTS: Precision,      recall, and F-measure were evaluated at a range of sample weightings  Work saved       over sampling at 95% recall was used as the measure of value to the review      process  RESULTS: A reduction in the number of articles needing manual review was      found for 11 of the 15 drug review topics studied  For three of the topics, the      reduction was 50% or greater  CONCLUSION: Automated document citation      classification could be a useful tool in maintaining systematic reviews of the      efficacy of drug therapy  Further work is needed to refine the classification      system and determine the best manner to integrate the system into the production       of systematic reviews

PMID- 16357351   - OBJECTIVE: Motivated by the need to push further our understanding of physicians'      acceptance of clinical information systems, we propose a relatively new      construct, namely, psychological ownership  We situated the construct within a      nomological net using a prevailing and dominant information technology adoption      behavior model as a logical starting point  DESIGN: A mail survey was sent to the      population of users of a regional physician order entry  POE  system aimed at      speeding up the transmission of clinical data, mainly laboratory tests and      radiology examinations, within a community health network  MEASUREMENTS: All      scales, but one, were measured using previously validated instruments  For its      part, the psychological ownership scale was developed using a multistage      iterative procedure  RESULTS: Ninety-one questionnaires were returned to the      researchers, for a response rate of 72 8%  Our findings reveal that, in order to       foster physicians' adoption of a clinical information system, it is important to       encourage and cultivate a positive attitude toward using the new system  In this       connection, positive perception of the technology's usefulness is crucial       Second, results demonstrate that psychological ownership of a POE system is      positively associated with physicians' perceptions of system utility and system      user friendliness  Last, through their active involvement and participation,      physicians feel they have greater influence on the development process, thereby      developing feelings of ownership toward the clinical system  CONCLUSION:      Psychological ownership's highly significant associations with user participation      and crucial beliefs driving technology acceptance behaviors among physicians      affirm the value of this construct in extending our understanding of POE      adoption

PMID- 16357345   - Recently there has been a remarkable upsurge in activity surrounding the adoption      of personal health record  PHR  systems for patients and consumers  The      biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities      and utility of PHR systems  In addition, the lack of a proven business case for     widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption  In a 2005 working symposium, the      American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics      discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed      recommendations for PHR-promoting activities  Personal health record systems are       more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data,      knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants       in their own care  When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record      systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for     consumers  This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems      and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures,      benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption

PMID- 16221948   - Laypersons  "consumers"  often have difficulty finding, understanding, and acting      on health information due to gaps in their domain knowledge  Ideally, consumer     health vocabularies  CHVs  would reflect the different ways consumers express and      think about health topics, helping to bridge this vocabulary gap  However,      despite the recent research on mismatches between consumer and professional      language  e g , lexical, semantic, and explanatory , there have been few      systematic efforts to develop and evaluate CHVs  This paper presents the point of      view that CHV development is practical and necessary for extending research on      informatics-based tools to facilitate consumer health information seeking,      retrieval, and understanding  In support of the view, we briefly describe a      distributed, bottom-up approach for  1  exploring the relationship between common      consumer health expressions and professional concepts and  2  developing an      open-access, preliminary  draft  "first-generation" CHV  While recognizing the      limitations of the approach  e g , not addressing psychosocial and cultural      factors , we suggest that such exploratory research and development will yield      insights into the nature of consumer health expressions and assist developers in       creating tools and applications to support consumer health information seeking

PMID- 16221943   - OBJECTIVE: Although the patient Internet portal is a potentially transformative      technology, there is little scientific information about the demographic and      clinical characteristics of portal enrollees and the features that they access       DESIGN: We describe two pilot studies of a comprehensive Internet portal called      PatientSite  These pilots include a prospective one-year cohort study of all      patients who enrolled in April 2003 and a case-control study in 2004 of enrollees      and nonenrollees at two hospital-based primary care practices  MEASUREMENTS: The       cohort study tracked patient enrollment and features in PatientSite that      enrollees accessed, such as laboratory and radiology results, prescription      renewals, appointment requests, managed care referrals, and clinical messaging       The case-control study used medical record review to compare the demographic and       clinical characteristics of 100 randomly selected PatientSite enrollees and 100      nonenrollees  RESULTS: PatientSite use grew steadily after its introduction  New       enrollees logged in most frequently in the first month, but 26% to 77% of the      cohort continued to access the portal at least monthly  They most often examined       laboratory and radiology results and sent clinical messages to their providers       PatientSite enrollees were younger and more affluent and had fewer medical      problems than nonenrollees  CONCLUSION: Expanding the use of patient portals will      require an understanding of obstacles that prevent access for those who might      benefit most from this technology

PMID- 16221942   - OBJECTIVE: Infobuttons are message-based content search and retrieval functions      embedded within other applications that dynamically return information relevant      to the clinical task at hand  The objective of this study was to determine      whether infobuttons effectively answer providers' questions about medications or       affect patient care decisions  DESIGN: The authors implemented and evaluated a      medication infobutton application called KnowledgeLink  Health care providers at       18 outpatient clinics were randomized to one of two versions of KnowledgeLink,      one that linked to information from Micromedex  Thomson Micromedex, Greenwood      Village, Co  and the other to material from SkolarMD  Wolters Kluwer Health, Palo      Alto, CA   MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected about the frequency of use and      demographics of users, patients, and drugs that were queried  Users were      periodically surveyed with short questionnaires and then with a more extensive      survey at the end of one year  RESULTS: During the first year, KnowledgeLink was       used 7,972 times by 359 users to look up information about 1,723 medications for       4,961 patients  Clinicians used KnowledgeLink twice a month on average, and      during an average of 1 2% of patient encounters  KnowledgeLink was used by a wide      variety of medical staff, not just physicians and nurse practitioners  The      frequency of usage and the questions asked varied with user role  primary care      physician, specialist physician, nurse practitioner   Although the median      KnowledgeLink session was brief  21 seconds , KnowledgeLink answered users'      queries 84% of the time, and altered patient care decisions 15% of the time       Users rated KnowledgeLink favorably on multiple scales, recommended extending      KnowledgeLink to other content domains, and suggested enhancing the interface to       allow refinement of the query and selection of the target resource  CONCLUSION:      An infobutton can satisfy information needs about medications  Although used      infrequently and for brief sessions, KnowledgeLink was positively received,      answered most users' questions, and had a significant impact on medical decision       making  The next steps would be to broaden the domains that KnowledgeLink covers       to more specifically tailor results to the user type, to provide options when      queries are not immediately answered, and to implement KnowledgeLink within other     electronic clinical applications

PMID- 16221941   - Computerized drug prescribing alerts can improve patient safety, but are often      overridden because of poor specificity and alert overload  Our objective was to      improve clinician acceptance of drug alerts by designing a selective set of drug       alerts for the ambulatory care setting and minimizing workflow disruptions by      designating only critical to high-severity alerts to be interruptive to clinician      workflow  The alerts were presented to clinicians using computerized prescribing       within an electronic medical record in 31 Boston-area practices  There were      18,115 drug alerts generated during our six-month study period  Of these, 12,933        71%  were noninterruptive and 5,182  29%  interruptive  Of the 5,182      interruptive alerts, 67% were accepted  Reasons for overrides varied for each      drug alert category and provided potentially useful information for future alert       improvement  These data suggest that it is possible to design computerized      prescribing decision support with high rates of alert recommendation acceptance      by clinicians

PMID- 16221940   - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an automated method for determining the set of      patients for whom a given primary care physician holds overall clinical      responsibility  DESIGN: The study included all adult patients  16,185  seen at      least once in an ambulatory setting during a three-year period by 18 primary care      physicians in ten practices  The physicians indicated whether they considered      themselves to be the physician primarily responsible for the overall clinical      care of each visiting patient  Statistical models were constructed to predict the      physicians' designations using predictor variables derived from electronically      available appointment schedules and demographic information  MEASUREMENTS:      Predictive accuracy was assessed primarily using the area under the      receiver-operating characteristic curve  AUC , and secondarily using positive      predictive value  PPV  and sensitivity  RESULTS: A minimal set of six variables      was identified as predictive of the physicians' designations  The constructed      model had a median AUC for individual physicians of 0 92  interquartile interval:      0 90-0 96 , a PPV of 0 94  interquartile interval: 0 87-0 95 , and a sensitivity       of 0 95  interquartile interval: 0 87-0 97   CONCLUSION: A statistical model      using a minimal set of commonly available electronic data can accurately predict       the set of patients for whom a physician holds primary clinical responsibility       Further research examining the generalization of the model to other settings      would be valuable

PMID- 16221939   - Clinical Document Architecture, Release One  CDA R1 , became an American National      Standards Institute  ANSI -approved HL7 Standard in November 2000, representing      the first specification derived from the Health Level 7  HL7  Reference      Information Model  RIM   CDA, Release Two  CDA R2 , became an ANSI-approved HL7      Standard in May 2005 and is the subject of this article, where the focus is      primarily on how the standard has evolved since CDA R1, particularly in the area       of semantic representation of clinical events  CDA is a document markup standard       that specifies the structure and semantics of a clinical document  such as a      discharge summary or progress note  for the purpose of exchange  A CDA document      is a defined and complete information object that can include text, images,      sounds, and other multimedia content  It can be transferred within a message and       can exist independently, outside the transferring message  CDA documents are      encoded in Extensible Markup Language  XML , and they derive their machine      processable meaning from the RIM, coupled with terminology  The CDA R2 model is      richly expressive, enabling the formal representation of clinical statements       such as observations, medication administrations, and adverse events  such that       they can be interpreted and acted upon by a computer  On the other hand, CDA R2      offers a low bar for adoption, providing a mechanism for simply wrapping a      non-XML document with the CDA header or for creating a document with a structured      header and sections containing only narrative content  The intent is to      facilitate widespread adoption, while providing a mechanism for incremental      semantic interoperability

PMID- 16221938   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether algorithms developed for the World Wide Web can      be applied to the biomedical literature in order to identify articles that are      important as well as relevant  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS A direct comparison of      eight algorithms: simple PubMed queries, clinical queries  sensitive and specific      versions , vector cosine comparison, citation count, journal impact factor,      PageRank, and machine learning based on polynomial support vector machines  The      objective was to prioritize important articles, defined as being included in a      pre-existing bibliography of important literature in surgical oncology  RESULTS      Citation-based algorithms were more effective than noncitation-based algorithms      at identifying important articles  The most effective strategies were simple      citation count and PageRank, which on average identified over six important      articles in the first 100 results compared to 0 85 for the best noncitation-based      algorithm  p < 0 001   The authors saw similar differences between citation-based      and noncitation-based algorithms at 10, 20, 50, 200, 500, and 1,000 results  p <       0 001   Citation lag affects performance of PageRank more than simple citation      count  However, in spite of citation lag, citation-based algorithms remain more      effective than noncitation-based algorithms  CONCLUSION Algorithms that have      proved successful on the World Wide Web can be applied to biomedical information       retrieval  Citation-based algorithms can help identify important articles within       large sets of relevant results  Further studies are needed to determine whether     citation-based algorithms can effectively meet actual user information needs

PMID- 16221936   - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was threefold  First, we gathered and      synthesized the historic literature regarding electronic health record  EHR       adoption rates among physicians in small practices  ten or fewer members   Next,       we constructed models to project estimated future EHR adoption trends and      timelines  We then determined the likelihood of achieving universal EHR adoption       in the near future and articulate how barriers can be overcome in the small and      solo practice medical environment  DESIGN: This study used EHR adoption data from      six previous surveys of small practices to estimate historic market penetration      rates  Applying technology diffusion theory, three future adoption scenarios,      optimistic, best estimate, and conservative, are empirically derived       MEASUREMENT: EHR adoption parameters, external and internal coefficients of      influence, are estimated using Bass diffusion models  RESULTS: All three EHR     scenarios display the characteristic diffusion S curve that is indicative that      the technology is likely to achieve significant market penetration, given enough       time  Under current conditions, EHR adoption will reach its maximum market share       in 2024 in the small practice setting  CONCLUSION: The promise of improved care      quality and cost control has prompted a call for universal EHR adoption by 2014        The EHR products now available are unlikely to achieve full diffusion in a      critical market segment within the time frame being targeted by policy makers

PMID- 16221933   - Quasi-experimental study designs, often described as nonrandomized, pre-post      intervention studies, are common in the medical informatics literature  Yet      little has been written about the benefits and limitations of the      quasi-experimental approach as applied to informatics studies  This paper     outlines a relative hierarchy and nomenclature of quasi-experimental study      designs that is applicable to medical informatics intervention studies  In      addition, the authors performed a systematic review of two medical informatics      journals, the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association  JAMIA  and      the International Journal of Medical Informatics  IJMI , to determine the number       of quasi-experimental studies published and how the studies are classified on the      above-mentioned relative hierarchy  They hope that future medical informatics      studies will implement higher level quasi-experimental study designs that yield      more convincing evidence for causal links between medical informatics      interventions and outcomes

PMID- 16049233   - OBJECTIVE: The Enriched Semantic Network  ESN  was introduced as an extension of       the Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  Semantic Network  SN   Its multiple      subsumption configuration and concomitant multiple inheritance make the ESN's      relationship structures and semantic type assignments different from those of the      SN  A technique for deriving the relationship structures of the ESN's semantic      types and an automated technique for deriving the ESN's semantic type assignments      from those of the SN are presented  DESIGN: The technique to derive the ESN's      relationship structures finds all newly inherited relationships in the ESN  All      such relationships are audited for semantic validity, and the blocking mechanism       is used to block invalid relationships  The mapping technique to derive the ESN's      semantic type assignments uses current SN semantic type assignments and preserves      nonredundant categorizations, while preventing new redundant categorizations       RESULTS: Among the 426 newly inherited relationships, 326 are deemed valid  Seven      blockings are applied to avoid inheritance of the 100 invalid relationships       Sixteen semantic types have different relationship structures in the ESN as      compared to those in the SN  The mapping of semantic type assignments from the SN      to the ESN avoids the generation of 26,950 redundant categorizations  The      resulting ESN contains 138 semantic types, 149 IS-A links, 7,303 relationships,      and 1,013,876 semantic type assignments  CONCLUSION: The ESN's multiple      inheritance provides more complete relationship structures than in the SN  The      ESN's semantic type assignments avoid the existing redundant categorizations      appearing in the SN and prevent new ones that might arise due to multiple      parents  Compared to the SN, the ESN provides a more accurate unifying semantic      abstraction of the UMLS Metathesaurus

PMID- 16049232   - OBJECTIVE: An important part of public health is identifying patterns of poor     health and deprivation  Specific patterns of poor health may be associated with      features of the geographic environment where contamination or pollution may be      occurring  For example, there may be clusters of poor health surrounding nuclear       power stations, whereas major roads or rivers may be associated with areas of      poor health alongside the feature in chains  Current methods are limited in their     capacity to search for complex patterns in geographic data sets  The objective of      this study was to determine whether graph theory could be used to identify      patterns of geographic areas that have high levels of deprivation, morbidity, and      mortality in a public health database  The geographic areas used in the study      were enumeration districts  EDs , which are the lowest level of census geography       in England and Wales, representing on average 200 households in the 1991 census        More specifically, the study aimed to identify chains of EDs with high      deprivation, morbidity, and mortality that might be adjacent to specific types of      geographic features, i e , rivers or major roads  DESIGN: The maximum common      subgraph  MCS  algorithm was used to search for seven query patterns of      deprivation and poor health within the Trent region  Query pattern 1 represented       a linear chain of five EDs and query patterns 2 to 7 represented the possible      clusters of the five EDs  To identify chains of EDs with high deprivation,      morbidity, and mortality, the results from the query patterns 2 to 7 were used to      remove patterns  option 1  and EDs  option 2  from the results of query pattern      1  MEASUREMENTS: Data on the Townsend Material Deprivation Index, standardized      long-term limiting illness and standardized all-cause mortality rates were used      for the 10,665 EDs within the Trent region  RESULTS: The MCS algorithm retrieved       a range of patterns and EDs from the database for the queries  Query pattern 1      identified 3,838 patterns containing a total of 195 EDs  When the patterns      retrieved using query patterns 2 to 7 were removed from the 3,838 patterns using       option 1, 1,704 patterns remained containing 161 EDs  When the EDs retrieved      using query patterns 2 to 7 were removed from the 195 EDs identified by query      pattern 1 using option 2, 12 EDs remained  The MCS algorithm was therefore able      to reduce the numbers of patterns and EDs to allow manual examination for chains       of EDs and for that which might be associated with them  CONCLUSION: The study      demonstrates the potential of the MCS algorithm for searching for specific      patterns of need  This method has potential for identifying such patterns in      relation to local geographic features for public health

PMID- 16049230   - OBJECTIVE: Contemporary health care places enormous health information management      demands on laypeople  Insights into their skills and habits complements current      developments in consumer health innovations, including personal health records       Using a five-element human factors model of work, health information management      in the household  HIMH  is characterized by the tasks completed by individuals      within household organizations, using certain tools and technologies in a given      physical environment  DESIGN: We conducted a descriptive-exploratory study of the      work of HIMH, involving 49 community-dwelling volunteers from a rural Midwestern       community  MEASUREMENTS: During in-person interviews, we collected data using      semistructured questionnaires and photographs of artifacts used for HIMH       RESULTS: The work of HIMH is largely the responsibility of a single individual,      primarily engaged in the tasks of acquiring, managing, and organizing a diverse      set of health information  Paper-based tools are most common, and residents      develop strategies for storing information in the household environment aligned      with anticipated use  Affiliative relationships, e g , parent-child or spousal,      within the household serve as the organization that gives rise to health      information management practices  Synthesis of these findings led to      identification of several storage strategies employed in HIMH  These strategies      are labeled "just-in-time," "just-because," "just-in-case," and "just-at-hand,"      reflecting location of the artifacts of health information and anticipated      urgency in the need to retrieve it  CONCLUSION: Laypeople develop and employ      robust, complex strategies for managing health information in the home       Capitalizing on these strategies will complement and extend current consumer     health innovations to provide functional support to people who face increasing      demands to manage personal health information

PMID- 16049228   - General practice research databases are increasingly used to study intended and      unintended effects of treatments  However, confounding by indication remains a      major problem  The randomized database study methodology has been proposed as a      method to combine the strengths of observational database  generalizability  and       the strength of the randomized clinical trial  RCT  design  randomization   We      developed an infrastructure that enables the execution of randomized database      studies with treatment randomization facilitated by a general practice research      database  The requirements posed by the methodology of randomized database      studies were facilitated by software components  Our assessment showed that it is      technically possible to conduct randomized trials in general practice according      to the randomized database design  The infrastructure facilitated the conduct of       randomized database studies in general practice but some practical difficulties      and methodological issues remain  The technical infrastructure seems to be both      promising and potentially feasible to facilitate future randomized database      studies, although the methodology needs to be evaluated in more detail

PMID- 16049227   - OBJECTIVE: To generate and measure the reliability for a reference standard set      with representative cases from seven broad syndromic case definitions and several      narrower syndromic definitions used for biosurveillance  DESIGN: From 527,228      eligible patients between 1990 and 2003, we generated a set of patients      potentially positive for seven syndromes by classifying all eligible patients      according to their ICD-9 primary discharge diagnoses  We selected a      representative subset of the cases for chart review by physicians, who read      emergency department reports and assigned values to 14 variables related to the      seven syndromes  MEASUREMENTS:  1  Positive predictive value of the ICD-9      diagnoses;  2  prevalence of the syndromic definitions and related variables;  3       agreement between physician raters demonstrated by kappa, kappa corrected for     bias and prevalence, and Finn's r; and  4  reliability of the reference standard       classifications demonstrated by generalizability coefficients  RESULTS: Positive       predictive value for ICD-9 classification ranged from 0 33 for botulinic to 0 86       for gastrointestinal  We generated between 80 and 566 positive cases for six of      the seven syndromic definitions  Rash syndrome exhibited low prevalence  34      cases   Agreement between physician raters was high, with kappa > 0 70 for most      variables  Ratings showed no bias  Finn's r was >0 70 for all variables       Generalizability coefficients were >0 70 for all variables but three  CONCLUSION:      Of the 27 syndromes generated by the 14 variables, 21 showed high enough      prevalence, agreement, and reliability to be used as reference standard      definitions against which an automated syndromic classifier could be compared       Syndromic definitions that showed poor agreement or low prevalence include      febrile botulinic syndrome, febrile and nonfebrile rash syndrome, respiratory      syndrome explained by a nonrespiratory or noninfectious diagnosis, and febrile      and nonfebrile gastrointestinal syndrome explained by a nongastrointestinal or     noninfectious diagnosis

PMID- 16049226   - Mechanical ventilators are designed to generate alarms when patients become      disconnected or experience other critical ventilator events  However, these      alarms can blend in with other accustomed sounds of the intensive care unit       Ventilator alarms that go unnoticed for extended periods of time often result in       permanent patient harm or death  We developed a system to monitor critical      ventilator events through our existing hospital network  Whenever an event is      identified, the new system takes control of every computer in the patient's      intensive care unit and generates an enhanced audio and visual alert indicating      that there is a critical ventilator event and identifies the room number  Once      the alert is acknowledged or the event is corrected, all the computers are      restored back to the pre-alert status and/or application  This paper describes      the development and implementation of this system and reports the initial      results, user acceptance, and the increase in valuable information and patient      safety

PMID- 15905488   - This paper describes an institutional approach taken to build a primary care      reference portal  The objective for the site is to make access to and use of      clinical reference faster and easier and to facilitate the use of evidence-based       answers in daily practice  Reference objects were selected and metadata applied      to a core set of sources  Metadata were used to search, sort, and filter results       and to define deep-linked queries and structure the interface  User feedback      resulted in an expansion in the scope of reference objects to meet the broad      spectrum of information needs, including patient handouts and interactive risk      management tools  RESULTS of a user satisfaction survey suggest that a simple      interface to customized content makes it faster and easier for primary care      clinicians to find information during the clinic day and to improve care to their     patients  The PrimeAnswers portal is a first step in creating a fast search of a       customized set of reference objects to match a clinician's patient care questions      in the clinic  The next step is developing methods to solve the problem of      matching a clinician's question to a specific answer through precise retrieval      from reference sources; however, lack of internal structure and Web service      standards in most clinical reference sources is an unresolved problem

PMID- 15905487   - A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the impact of      electronic health records  EHRs  on documentation time of physicians and nurses      and to identify factors that may explain efficiency differences across studies       In total, 23 papers met our inclusion criteria; five were randomized controlled      trials, six were posttest control studies, and 12 were one-group pretest-posttest      designs  Most studies  58%  collected data using a time and motion methodology in      comparison to work sampling  33%  and self-report/survey methods  8%   A weighted      average approach was used to combine results from the studies  The use of bedside      terminals and central station desktops saved nurses, respectively, 24 5% and      23 5% of their overall time spent documenting during a shift  Using bedside or     point-of-care systems increased documentation time of physicians by 17 5%  In      comparison, the use of central station desktops for computerized provider order     entry  CPOE  was found to be inefficient, increasing the work time from 98 1% to       328 6% of physician's time per working shift  weighted average of CPOE-oriented      studies, 238 4%   Studies that conducted their evaluation process relatively soon      after implementation of the EHR tended to demonstrate a reduction in      documentation time in comparison to the increases observed with those that had a       longer time period between implementation and the evaluation process  This review      highlighted that a goal of decreased documentation time in an EHR project is not       likely to be realized  It also identified how the selection of bedside or central      station desktop EHRs may influence documentation time for the two main user     groups, physicians and nurses

PMID- 15905486   - OBJECTIVE: To help biomedical researchers recognize dynamically introduced      abbreviations in biomedical literature, such as gene and protein names, we have      constructed a support system called ALICE  Abbreviation LIfter using Corpus-based      Extraction   ALICE aims to extract all types of abbreviations with their     expansions from a target paper on the fly  METHODS: ALICE extracts an      abbreviation and its expansion from the literature by using heuristic      pattern-matching rules  This system consists of three phases and potentially      identifies valid 320 abbreviation-expansion patterns as combinations of the      rules  RESULTS: It achieved 95% recall and 97% precision on randomly selected      titles and abstracts from the MEDLINE database  CONCLUSION: ALICE extracted      abbreviations and their expansions from the literature efficiently  The subtly      compiled heuristics enabled it to extract abbreviations with high recall without       significantly reducing precision  ALICE does not only facilitate recognition of      an undefined abbreviation in a paper by constructing an abbreviation database or       dictionary, but also makes biomedical literature retrieval more accurate  This      system is freely available at http://uvdb3 hgc jp/ALICE/ALICE_index html

PMID- 15905484   - We studied the effect of a structured electronic communication service on health       care spending, comparing doctor office and laboratory spending for a group of      patients before and after the service became available to them relative to      changes in a control group  In the treatment group, doctor office spending and      laboratory spending fell in the period after the service became available,      relative to the control group  p < 0 05   A rough estimate is that average doctor     office spending per treatment group member per month fell $1 71 after     availability of the service, and laboratory spending fell roughly $0 12  Spending      associated with use of the electronic service was $0 29 per member per month  We       conclude that use of structured electronic visits can reduce health care      spending

PMID- 15905483   - BACKGROUND: Unintended consequences of computerized patient care system      interventions may increase resource use, foster clinical errors, and reduce      users' confidence  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate three successive interventions designed      to reduce serum magnesium test ordering through a care provider order entry      system  CPOE   The second, modeled after a previously successful intervention,      caused paradoxical increases in magnesium test ordering rates  DESIGN: A      time-series analysis modeled weekly rates of magnesium test ordering, underlying       trends, the impact of the three successive interventions, and the impact of      potential covariates  The first intervention exhorted users to discontinue      unnecessary tests recurring more than 72 hours into the future  The second      displayed recent magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus test results, limited testing      to one test instance per order, and provided education regarding appropriate      indications for testing  The third targeted only magnesium ordering, displayed      recent results, limited testing to one instance per order, summarized indications      for testing, and required users to select an indication  PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians      at Vanderbilt University Hospital, a 609-bed academic inpatient tertiary care      facility, from 1998 through 2003  MEASUREMENTS: Weekly rates of new serum      magnesium test orders, instances, and results  RESULTS: At baseline, there were      539 magnesium tests ordered per week  This decreased to 380  p = 0 001  per week       after the first intervention, increased to 491 per week  p < 0 001  after the      second, and decreased to 276 per week  p < 0 001  after the third  CONCLUSION: A       clinical decision support intervention intended to regulate testing increased      test order rates as an unintended result of decision support  CPOE implementers      must carefully design resource-related interventions and monitor their impact      over time

PMID- 15905482   - OBJECTIVE: To describe strategies that organizations select to support      physicians' use of handheld computers  HHCs  in clinical practice and to explore       issues about facilitating HHC use  DESIGN: A multidisciplinary team used focus      groups and interviews with clinical, administrative, and information technology       IT  staff to gather data from 161 informants at seven sites  Transcripts were      coded using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches to both answer     research questions and identify patterns and themes that emerged in the data       MEASUREMENTS: Answers to questions about strategies for HHC support and themes      about  1  how to facilitate physician adoption and use and  2  organizational      concerns  RESULTS: Three main organizational strategies for HHC support were      characterized among sites:  1  active support for broad-based use,  2  active      support for niche use, and  3  basic support for individual physician users       Three high-level themes emerged around how to best facilitate physician adoption       and use of HHCs:  1  improving usability and usefulness,  2  promoting HHCs and      device use, and  3  providing training and support  However, four major themes      also emerged related to organizations' concerns about HHC use:  1       security-related concerns,  2  economic concerns,  3  technical concerns, and  4       strategic concerns  CONCLUSION: An organizational approach to HHC support that      involves individualized attention to existing and potential physician users      rather than one-size-fits-all, organization-wide implementation efforts was an      important facilitator promoting physician use of HHCs  Health care organizations       interested in supporting HHC use must consider issues related to security,      economics, and IT strategy that may not be prominent concerns for physician      users

PMID- 15905479   - OBJECTIVE: To describe medical students' attitudes toward placing orders during      training, and the effect of computerized provider order entry  CPOE  on their     learning experiences  DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study of all 143 Johns      Hopkins University School of Medicine students who began the Basic Medicine      clerkship between March 2003 and April 2004 at one of three teaching hospitals:      one using CPOE, one paper orders, and one that began using CPOE midway through      this study  MEASUREMENTS: Survey of students at the start and after the first      month of the clerkship  RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of students responded       Students expressed a desire to place 100% of orders for their patients       Ninety-five percent of students believed that placing orders helps students learn      what tests and treatments patients need  Eighty-four percent reported that being       unavailable due to conferences and teaching sessions was a significant barrier to      participating in the ordering process  Students at hospitals using CPOE reported       placing significantly fewer of their patients' follow-up orders compared to      students at hospitals using paper orders  25% vs  50%, p < 0 01  and were more      likely to report that their resident or intern did not want them to enter orders        40% vs  16%, p < 0 01   Comparisons of students at hospitals using CPOE to each       other showed that these differences were attributable to one of the hospitals       Thirty-two percent of students at both hospitals using CPOE reported that the      extra length of time required for housestaff to review their orders in the      computer was a significant barrier  CONCLUSION: Hospitals need to ensure that the      educational potential of medical students' clinical experiences is maximized when      implementing CPOE

PMID- 15905478   - OBJECTIVES: Computer-based provider order entry  CPOE  systems are implemented to      increase both efficiency and accuracy in health care, but these systems often      cause a myriad of emotions to arise  This qualitative research investigates the      emotions surrounding CPOE implementation and use  METHODS: We performed a      secondary analysis of several previously collected qualitative data sets from      interviews and observations of over 50 individuals  Three researchers worked in      parallel to identify themes that expressed emotional responses to CPOE  We then      reviewed and classified these quotes using a validated hierarchical taxonomy of      semantically homogeneous terms associated with specific emotions  RESULTS: The      implementation and use of CPOE systems provoked examples of positive, negative,      and neutral emotions  Negative emotional responses were the most prevalent, by      far, in all the observations  CONCLUSION: Designing and implementing CPOE systems      is difficult  These systems and the implementation process itself often inspire      intense emotions  If designers and implementers fail to recognize that various      CPOE features and implementation strategies can increase clinicians' negative      emotions, then the systems may fail to become a routine part of the clinical care      delivery process  We might alleviate some of these problems by designing positive      feedback mechanisms for both the systems and the organizations

PMID- 15905477   - Medical imaging informatics must exceed the mere development of algorithms  The      discipline is also responsible for the establishment of methods in clinical      practice to assist physicians and improve health care  From our point of view, it      is commonly accepted that model-based analysis of medical images is superior to      other concepts, but only a few applications are found in daily clinical use  The       gap between development of model-based image analysis and its routine application      can be addressed by identifying four necessary transfer steps: formulation,      parameterization, instantiation, and validation  Usually, computer scientists      formulate the model and define its parameterization, i e , configure a model to      handle a selected subset of clinical data  During instantiation, the algorithm      adapts the model to the actual data, which is validated by physicians  Since      medical a priori knowledge and particular knowledge on technical details are      required for parameterization and validation, these steps are considered to be      bottlenecks  In this paper, we propose general schemes that allow an application-      or image-specific parameterization to be performed by medical users  Combining      noncontextual and contextual approaches, we also suggest a reliable scheme that      allows application-specific validation, even if a gold standard is unavailable       To emphasize our point of view, we provide examples based on unsupervised      segmentation in medical imagery, which is one of the most difficult tasks       Following the proposed schemes, an exact delineation of cells in micrographs is      parameterized, validated, and successfully established in daily clinical use,      while automatic determination of body regions in radiographs cannot be configured      to support reliable and robust clinical use  The results stress that      parameterization and validation must be based on clinical data that show all      potential variations and artifact sources

PMID- 15802487   - OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluated whether displaying context sensitive links to      infrequently accessed educational materials and patient information via the user       interface of an inpatient computerized care provider order entry  CPOE  system      would affect access rates to the materials  DESIGN: The CPOE of Vanderbilt      University Hospital  VUH  included "baseline" clinical decision support advice      for safety and quality  Authors augmented this with seven new primarily      educational decision support features  A prospective, randomized, controlled      trial compared clinicians' utilization rates for the new materials via two      interfaces  Control subjects could access study-related decision support from a      menu in the standard CPOE interface  Intervention subjects received active      notification when study-related decision support was available through context      sensitive, visibly highlighted, selectable hyperlinks  MEASUREMENTS: Rates of      opportunities to access and utilization of study-related decision support      materials from April 1999 through March 2000 on seven VUH Internal Medicine      wards  RESULTS: During 4,466 intervention subject-days, there were 240,504       53 9/subject-day  opportunities for study-related decision support, while during      3,397 control subject-days, there were 178,235  52 5/subject-day  opportunities      for such decision support, respectively  p = 0 11   Individual intervention      subjects accessed the decision support features at least once on 3 8% of      subject-days logged on  278 responses ; controls accessed it at least once on      0 6% of subject-days  18 responses , with a response rate ratio adjusted for     decision support frequency of 9 17  95% confidence interval 4 6-18, p < 0 0005         On average, intervention subjects accessed study-related decision support      materials once every 16 days individually and once every 1 26 days in aggregate        CONCLUSION: Highlighting availability of context-sensitive educational materials       and patient information through visible hyperlinks significantly increased      utilization rates for study-related decision support when compared to "standard"       VUH CPOE methods, although absolute response rates were low

PMID- 15802486   - OBJECTIVE: Charting systems with decision support have been developed to assist      with medication charting, but many of the features of these programs are not      properly used in their clinical application  An analysis of medication error     reports at LDS Hospital revealed the occurrence of errors that should have been      detected and prevented by decision support features if real-time entry at the      bedside had taken place  The aim of this study was to increase the real-time      bedside charting behavior of nurses  DESIGN: A quasiexperimental before and after     design was used  The study took place in two 40-bed surgical units, one of which       served as the study unit, the other as control unit  The study unit received      educational intervention about error avoidance through real-time bedside      charting, and 12 weeks of monitoring and performance feedback  The real-time and       bedside charting rates for the study and control units were measured before and      after the intervention  RESULTS: Before the intervention on the study unit, the      real-time charting rate was 59% and the bedside rate was 40%  At the conclusion      of a 12-week intervention period, the real-time rate increased to 73% and the      bedside rate increased to 63%  Postintervention real-time rates were 75% after     eight weeks and remained at 75% after one year  Equivalent control unit real-time      rates varied from 53% to 57%, and bedside rates varied from 34% to 44% during the      same intervals  CONCLUSION: Targeted educational intervention and monitored      feedback yielded measurable improvements in the effective use of the computerized      medication charting system and must be an ongoing process

PMID- 15802485   - This case study of a serious medication error demonstrates the necessity of a      comprehensive methodology for the analysis of failures in interaction between      humans and information systems  The authors used a novel approach to analyze a      dosing error related to computer-based ordering of potassium chloride  KCl   The       method included a chronological reconstruction of events and their     interdependencies from provider order entry usage logs, semistructured interviews      with involved clinicians, and interface usability inspection of the ordering      system  Information collected from all sources was compared and evaluated to      understand how the error evolved and propagated through the system  In this case,      the error was the product of faults in interaction among human and system agents       that methods limited in scope to their distinct analytical domains would not      identify  The authors characterized errors in several converging aspects of the      drug ordering process: confusing on-screen laboratory results review, system      usability difficulties, user training problems, and suboptimal clinical system      safeguards that all contributed to a serious dosing error  The results of the      authors' analysis were used to formulate specific recommendations for interface      layout and functionality modifications, suggest new user alerts, propose changes       to user training, and address error-prone steps of the KCl ordering process to      reduce the risk of future medication dosing errors

PMID- 15802484   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of introducing health      information technology  HIT  on physician-patient interactions during outpatient       visits  DESIGN: This was a longitudinal pre-post study: two months before and one      and seven months after introduction of examination room computers  Patient      questionnaires  n = 313  after primary care visits with physicians  n = 8  within      an integrated delivery system  There were three patient satisfaction domains:  1       satisfaction with visit components,  2  comprehension of the visit, and  3       perceptions of the physician's use of the computer  RESULTS: Patients reported      that physicians used computers in 82 3% of visits  Compared with baseline,      overall patient satisfaction with visits increased seven months after the      introduction of computers  odds ratio [OR] = 1 50; 95% confidence interval [CI]:       1 01-2 22 , as did satisfaction with physicians' familiarity with patients  OR =       1 60, 95% CI: 1 01-2 52 , communication about medical issues  OR = 1 61; 95% CI:       1 05-2 47 , and comprehension of decisions made during the visit  OR = 1 63; 95%       CI: 1 06-2 50   In contrast, there were no significant changes in patient      satisfaction with comprehension of self-care responsibilities, communication      about psychosocial issues, or available visit time  Seven months      post-introduction, patients were more likely to report that the computer helped      the visit run in a more timely manner  OR = 1 76; 95% CI: 1 28-2 42  compared      with the first month after introduction  There were no other significant changes       in patient perceptions of the computer use over time  CONCLUSION: The examination      room computers appeared to have positive effects on physician-patient      interactions related to medical communication without significant negative      effects on other areas such as time available for patient concerns  Further study      is needed to better understand HIT use during outpatient visits

PMID- 15802483   - OBJECTIVE: The integration of SNOMED CT into the Unified Medical Language System        UMLS  involved the alignment of two views of synonymy that were different      because the two vocabulary systems have different intended purposes and editing      principles  The UMLS is organized according to one view of synonymy, but its      structure also represents all the individual views of synonymy present in its      source vocabularies  Despite progress in knowledge-based automation of      development and maintenance of vocabularies, manual curation is still the main      method of determining synonymy  The aim of this study was to investigate the      quality of human judgment of synonymy  DESIGN: Sixty pairs of potentially      controversial SNOMED CT synonyms were reviewed by 11 domain vocabulary experts       six UMLS editors and five noneditors , and scores were assigned according to the      degree of synonymy  MEASUREMENTS: The synonymy scores of each subject were      compared to the gold standard  the overall mean synonymy score of all subjects       to assess accuracy  Agreement between UMLS editors and noneditors was measured by      comparing the mean synonymy scores of editors to noneditors  RESULTS: Average      accuracy was 71% for UMLS editors and 75% for noneditors  difference not      statistically significant   Mean scores of editors and noneditors showed      significant positive correlation  Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0 654,       two-tailed p < 0 01  with a concurrence rate of 75% and an interrater agreement      kappa of 0 43  CONCLUSION: The accuracy in the judgment of synonymy was      comparable for UMLS editors and nonediting domain experts  There was reasonable      agreement between the two groups

PMID- 15802482   - OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based practices in preventive care and chronic disease      management are inconsistently implemented  Computerized clinical reminders  CRs        can improve compliance with these practices in outpatient settings  However,      since clinician adherence to CR recommendations is quite variable and declines      over time, we conducted observations to determine barriers and facilitators to      the effective use of CRs  DESIGN: We conducted an observational study of nurses      and providers interacting with CRs in outpatient primary care clinics for two      days in each of four geographically distributed Veterans Administration  VA       medical centers  MEASUREMENTS: Three observers recorded interactions of 35 nurses      and 55 physicians and mid-level practitioners with the CRs, which function as      part of an electronic medical record  Field notes were typed, coded in a      spreadsheet, and then sorted into logical categories  We then integrated findings      across observations into meaningful patterns and abstracted the data into themes,      such as recurrent strategies  Several of these themes translated directly to      barriers and facilitators to effective CR use  RESULTS: Optimally using the CR     system for its intended purpose was impeded by  1  lack of coordination between      nurses and providers;  2  using the reminders while not with the patient,      impairing data acquisition and/or implementation of recommended actions;  3       workload;  4  lack of CR flexibility; and  5  poor interface usability       Facilitators included  1  limiting the number of reminders at a site;  2       strategic location of the computer workstations;  3  integration of reminders      into workflow; and  4  the ability to document system problems and receive prompt      administrator feedback  CONCLUSION: We identified barriers that might explain      some of the variability in the use of CRs  Although these barriers may be      difficult to overcome, some strategies may increase user acceptance and therefore      the effectiveness of the CRs  These include explicitly assigning responsibility      for each CR to nurses or providers, improving visibility of positive results from      CRs in the electronic medical record, creating a feedback mechanism about CR use,      and limiting the overall number of CRs

PMID- 15802481   - A commercial rule base  Cerner Multum  was used to identify medication orders      exceeding recommended dosage limits at five hospitals within BJC HealthCare, an      integrated health care system  During initial testing, clinical pharmacists      determined that there was an excessive number of nuisance and clinically      insignificant alerts, with an overall alert rate of 9 2%  A method for     customizing the commercial rule base was implemented to increase rule specificity      for problematic rules  The system was subsequently deployed at two facilities and      achieved alert rates of less than 1%  Pharmacists screened these alerts and      contacted ordering physicians in 21% of cases  Physicians made therapeutic      changes in response to 38% of alerts presented to them  By applying simple      techniques to customize rules, commercial rule bases can be used to rapidly      deploy a safety net to screen drug orders for excessive dosages, while preserving      the rule architecture for later implementations of more finely tuned clinical      decision support

PMID- 15802477   - As part of an enterprise effort to develop new clinical information systems at      Intermountain Health Care, the authors have built a knowledge authoring tool that      facilitates the development and refinement of medical knowledge content  At      present, users of the application can compose order sets and an assortment of      other structured clinical knowledge documents based on XML schemas  The flexible       nature of the application allows the immediate authoring of new types of      documents once an appropriate XML schema and accompanying Web form have been      developed and stored in a shared repository  The need for a knowledge acquisition      tool stems largely from the desire for medical practitioners to be able to write       their own content for use within clinical applications  We hypothesize that      medical knowledge content for clinical use can be successfully created and      maintained through XML-based document frameworks containing structured and coded       knowledge

PMID- 15802476   - BACKGROUND: Clinical end users of EMBASE have a difficult time retrieving      articles that are both scientifically sound and directly relevant to clinical      practice  Search filters have been developed to assist end users in increasing      the success of their searches  Many filters have been developed for the      literature on therapy and reviews for use in MEDLINE, but little has been done      for use in EMBASE with no filter development for studies of prognosis  The      objective of this study was to determine how well various methodologic textwords,      index terms, and their Boolean combinations retrieve methodologically sound      literature on the prognosis of health disorders in EMBASE  METHODS: An analytic      survey was conducted, comparing hand searches of 55 journals with retrievals from      EMBASE for 4,843 candidate search terms and 8,919 combinations  All articles were      rated using purpose and quality indicators, and clinically relevant prognostic      articles were categorized as "pass" or "fail" according to explicit criteria for       scientific merit  Candidate search strategies were run in EMBASE, the retrievals       being compared with the hand search data  The sensitivity, specificity,      precision, and accuracy of the search strategies were calculated  RESULTS: Of the      1,064 articles about prognosis, 148  13 9%  met basic criteria for scientific      merit  Combinations of search terms reached peak sensitivities of 98 7% with      specificity at 50 6%  Compared with best single terms, best multiple terms      increased sensitivity for sound studies by 12 2%  absolute increase , while      decreasing specificity  absolute decrease 5 1%  when sensitivity was maximized       Combinations of search terms reached peak specificities of 93 4% with sensitivity      at 50 7%  Compared with best single terms, best multiple terms increased      specificity for sound studies by 7 1%  absolute increase , while decreasing      sensitivity  absolute decrease 8 8%  when specificity was maximized  CONCLUSION:       Empirically derived search strategies combining indexing terms and textwords can       achieve high sensitivity or specificity for retrieving sound prognostic studies      from EMBASE

PMID- 15684136   - OBJECTIVE: The use of icons and other graphical components in user interfaces has      become nearly ubiquitous  The interpretation of such icons is based on the      assumption that different users perceive the shapes similarly  At the most basic       level, different users must agree on which shapes are similar and which are      different  If this similarity can be measured, it may be usable as the basis to      design better icons  DESIGN: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel      method for categorizing the visual similarity of graphical primitives, called      Presentation Discovery, in the domain of mammography  Six domain experts were      given 50 common textual mammography findings and asked to draw how they would      represent those findings graphically  Nondomain experts sorted the resulting      graphics into groups based on their visual characteristics  The resulting groups       were then analyzed using traditional statistics and hypothesis discovery tools       Strength of agreement was evaluated using computational simulations of sorting      behavior  MEASUREMENTS: Sorter agreement was measured at both the individual      graphical and concept-group levels using a novel simulation-based method       "Consensus clusters" of graphics were derived using a hierarchical clustering      algorithm  RESULTS: The multiple sorters were able to reliably group graphics      into similar groups that strongly correlated with underlying domain concepts       Visual inspection of the resulting consensus clusters indicated that graphical      primitives that could be informative in the design of icons were present       CONCLUSION: The method described provides a rigorous alternative to intuitive      design processes frequently employed in the design of icons and other graphical      interface components

PMID- 15684133   - As the public interest in consumer-driven electronic health care applications      rises, so do concerns about the privacy and security of these applications       Achieving a balance between providing the necessary security while promoting user     acceptance is a major obstacle in large-scale deployment of applications such as       personal health records  PHRs   Robust and reliable forms of authentication are      needed for PHRs, as the record will often contain sensitive and protected health       information, including the patient's own annotations  Since the health care      industry per se is unlikely to succeed at single-handedly developing and      deploying a large scale, national authentication infrastructure, it makes sense      to leverage existing hardware, software, and networks  This report proposes a new      model for authentication of users to health care information applications,      leveraging wireless mobile devices  Cell phones are widely distributed, have high      user acceptance, and offer advanced security protocols  The authors propose      harnessing this technology for the strong authentication of individuals by      creating a registration authority and an authentication service, and examine the       problems and promise of such a system

PMID- 15684130   - Community health centers serve ethnically diverse populations that may pose      challenges for record linkage based on name and date of birth  The objective was       to identify an optimal deterministic algorithm to link patient encounters and      laboratory results for hemoglobin A1c testing and examine its variability by      health center site, patient ethnicity, and other variables  Based on data      elements of last name, first name, date of birth, gender, and health center site,      matches with >/=50% to < 100% of a maximum score were manually reviewed for true       matches  Match keys based on combinations of name substrings, date of birth,      gender, and health center were used to link encounter and laboratory files  The      optimal match key was the first two letters of the last name and date of birth,      which had a sensitivity of 92 7% and a positive predictive value of 99 5%       Sensitivity marginally varied by health center, age, gender, but not by      ethnicity  An algorithm that was inexpensive, accurate, and easy to implement was      found to be well suited for population-based measurement of clinical quality

PMID- 15684128   - OBJECTIVE: Patient use of online electronic medical records  EMR  holds the      potential to improve health outcomes  The purpose of this study is to discover     how patients living with chronic inflammatory bowel disease  IBD  value      Internet-based patient access to electronic patient records  DESIGN: This was a      qualitative, exploratory, descriptive study using in-depth interviews and focus      groups of a total of 12 patients with IBD of at least one-year duration at      University Health Network, a tertiary care center in Toronto, Ontario  RESULTS:      Four themes have been elucidated that comprise a theoretical framework of      patient-perceived information and communication technology usefulness: promotion       of a sense of illness ownership, of patient-driven communication, of personalized      support, and of mutual trust  CONCLUSIONS: For patients with chronic IBD, simply       providing access to electronic medical records has little usefulness on its own        Useful technology for patients with IBD is multifaceted, self-care promoting, and      integrated into the patient's already existing health and psychosocial support      infrastructure  The four identified themes can serve as focal points for the      evaluation of information technology designed for patient use, thus providing a      patient-centered framework for developers seeking to adapt existing EMR systems      to patient access and use for the purposes of improving health care quality and      health outcomes  Further studies in other populations are needed to enhance      generalizability of the emergent theory

PMID- 15684124   - BACKGROUND: Automated clinical decision support has shown promise in reducing      medication errors; however, clinicians often do not comply with alerts  Because      renal insufficiency is a common source of medication errors, the authors studied       a trial of alerts designed to reduce inpatient administration of medications      contraindicated due to renal insufficiency  METHODS: A minimum safe creatinine      clearance was established for each inpatient formulary medication  Alerts      recommending cancellation appeared when a medication order was initiated for a      patient whose estimated creatinine clearance was less than the minimum safe      creatinine clearance for the medication  Administration of medications in      patients with creatinine clearances less than the medication's minimum safe      clearance were studied for 14 months after, and four months before, alert      implementation  In addition, the impact of patient age, gender, degree of renal      dysfunction, time of day, and duration of housestaff training on the likelihood      of housestaff compliance with the alerts was examined  RESULTS: The likelihood of      a patient receiving at least one dose of contraindicated drug after the order was      initiated decreased from 89% to 47%  p < 0 0001  after alert implementation       Analysis of the alerts seen by housestaff showed that alert compliance was higher     in male patients  57% vs  38%, p = 0 02 , increased with the duration of      housestaff training  p = 0 04 , and increased in patients with worsening renal      function  p = 0 007   CONCLUSION: Alerts were effective in decreasing the      ordering and administration of drugs contraindicated due to renal insufficiency        Compliance with the alerts was higher in male patients, increased with the      duration of housestaff training, and increased in patients with more severe renal      dysfunction

PMID- 15684123   - Information retrieval studies that involve searching the Internet or marking      phrases usually lack a well-defined number of negative cases  This prevents the      use of traditional interrater reliability metrics like the kappa statistic to      assess the quality of expert-generated gold standards  Such studies often      quantify system performance as precision, recall, and F-measure, or as agreement       It can be shown that the average F-measure among pairs of experts is numerically       identical to the average positive specific agreement among experts and that kappa      approaches these measures as the number of negative cases grows large  Positive      specific agreement-or the equivalent F-measure-may be an appropriate way to      quantify interrater reliability and therefore to assess the reliability of a gold      standard in these studies

PMID- 15684122   - OBJECTIVE: To compare the functional capabilities being offered by commercial      ambulatory electronic prescribing systems with a set of expert panel      recommendations  DESIGN: A descriptive field study of ten commercially available       ambulatory electronic prescribing systems, each of which had established a      significant market presence  Data were collected from vendors by telephone      interview and at sites where the systems were functioning through direct      observation of the systems and through personal interviews with prescribers and      technical staff  MEASUREMENTS: The capabilities of electronic prescribing systems      were compared with 60 expert panel recommendations for capabilities that would      improve patient safety, health outcomes, or patients' costs  Each recommended      capability was judged as having been implemented fully, partially, or not at all       by each system to which the recommendation applied  Vendors' claims about      capabilities were compared with the capabilities found in the site visits       RESULTS: On average, the systems fully implemented 50% of the recommended      capabilities, with individual systems ranging from 26% to 64% implementation       Only 15% of the recommended capabilities were not implemented by any system       Prescribing systems that were part of electronic health records  EHRs  tended to       implement more recommendations  Vendors' claims about their systems' capabilities      had a 96% sensitivity and a 72% specificity when site visit findings were      considered the gold standard  CONCLUSIONS: The commercial electronic prescribing       marketplace may not be selecting for capabilities that would most benefit      patients  Electronic prescribing standards should include minimal functional      capabilities, and certification of adherence to standards may need to take place       where systems are installed and operating

PMID- 15561795   - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of a computerized guideline for glucose      regulation in an ICU  DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial with an off-on-off      design  METHODS: We implemented a glucose regulation guideline in an intensive      care unit in paper form during the first study period  During the second period,       the guideline was randomly applied in either paper or computerized form  In the      third period, the guideline was available only in paper form  MEASUREMENTS AND      RESULTS: We analyzed data for 484 patients  During the intervention period, the      control group included 54 patients and the computerized intervention group      included 66 patients  The two guideline-related outcome measures consisted of      compliance with:  a  glucose measurement timing recommendations and  b  insulin      dose advice  We measured clinical impact as the proportion of time that glucose      levels fell within target range  In the first  paper-based  study period, 29 0%      of samples occurred with optimal timing; during the second period, this increased      to 35 5% for paper-based and to 40 2% for computerized protocols  The third study      period timeliness scores reverted to the first period rates  Late  suboptimal       sampling occurred for 66% of glucose measurements in the first study period, for       42% of paper-based and 28% of computer-based protocol samples in the second      period, and for 50 0% of samples in the third study period  In the first study      period, insulin-dosing guideline compliance was 56 3%; in the second period, it      was 64 2% for paper-based and 77 3% for computer-based protocols, and it fell to       42 4% in the third period  For the second study period, the time that a patient's      glucose values fell within target range improved for both the control  52 9%  and      the computerized groups  54 2%  compared with the first study period  44 3%  and       the third period  42 3%   CONCLUSION: Implementing a computerized version of a      guideline significantly improved timeliness of measurements and glucose level      regulation for critically ill patients compared with implementing a paper-based      version of the guideline

PMID- 15561792   - OBJECTIVE: To identify the most frequent obstacles preventing physicians from      answering their patient-care questions and the most requested improvements to      clinical information resources  DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of questions asked      by 48 randomly selected generalist physicians during ambulatory care       MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of reported obstacles to answering patient-care questions      and recommendations from physicians for improving clinical information resources       RESULTS: The physicians asked 1,062 questions but pursued answers to only 585       55%   The most commonly reported obstacle to the pursuit of an answer was the      physician's doubt that an answer existed  52 questions, 11%   Among pursued      questions, the most common obstacle was the failure of the selected resource to      provide an answer  153 questions, 26%   During audiotaped interviews, physicians       made 80 recommendations for improving clinical information resources  For     example, they requested comprehensive resources that answer questions likely to      occur in practice with emphasis on treatment and bottom-line advice  They asked      for help in locating information quickly by using lists, tables, bolded      subheadings, and algorithms and by avoiding lengthy, uninterrupted prose       CONCLUSION: Physicians do not seek answers to many of their questions, often      suspecting a lack of usable information  When they do seek answers, they often      cannot find the information they need  Clinical resource developers could use the      recommendations made by practicing physicians to provide resources that are more       useful for answering clinical questions

PMID- 15561791   - Petri Nets  PNs  and their extensions are promising methods for modeling and      simulating biological systems  We surveyed PN formalisms and tools and compared      them based on their mathematical capabilities as well as by their appropriateness      to represent typical biological processes  We measured the ability of these tools      to model specific features of biological systems and answer a set of biological      questions that we defined  We found that different tools are required to provide       all capabilities that we assessed  We created software to translate a generic PN       model into most of the formalisms and tools discussed  We have also made      available three models and suggest that a library of such models would catalyze      progress in qualitative modeling via PNs  Development and wide adoption of common      formats would enable researchers to share models and use different tools to      analyze them without the need to convert to proprietary formats

PMID- 15561790   - OBJECTIVE: Biomedical databases summarize current scientific knowledge, but they       generally require years of laborious curation effort to build, focusing on      identifying pertinent literature and data in the voluminous biomedical      literature  It is difficult to manually extract useful information embedded in      the large volumes of literature, and automated intelligent text analysis tools      are becoming increasingly essential to assist in these curation activities  The      goal of the authors was to develop an automated method to identify articles in      Medline citations that contain pharmacogenetics data pertaining to gene-drug      relationships  DESIGN: The authors built and evaluated several candidate      statistical models that characterize pharmacogenetics articles in terms of word      usage and the profile of Medical Subject Headings  MeSH  used in those articles        The best-performing model was used to scan the entire Medline article database       11 million articles  to identify candidate pharmacogenetics articles  RESULTS: A      sampling of the articles identified from scanning Medline was reviewed by a      pharmacologist to assess the precision of the method  The authors' approach      identified 4,892 pharmacogenetics articles in the literature with 92% precision        Their automated method took a fraction of the time to acquire these articles      compared with the time expected to be taken to accumulate them manually  The      authors have built a Web resource       http://pharmdemo stanford edu/pharmdb/main spy  to provide access to their     results  CONCLUSION: A statistical classification approach can screen the primary      literature to pharmacogenetics articles with high precision  Such methods may      assist curators in acquiring pertinent literature in building biomedical      databases

PMID- 15561789   - OBJECTIVE Finding the best scientific evidence that applies to a patient problem       is becoming exceedingly difficult due to the exponential growth of medical      publications  The objective of this study was to apply machine learning      techniques to automatically identify high-quality, content-specific articles for       one time period in internal medicine and compare their performance with previous       Boolean-based PubMed clinical query filters of Haynes et al  DESIGN The selection      criteria of the ACP Journal Club for articles in internal medicine were the basis      for identifying high-quality articles in the areas of etiology, prognosis,      diagnosis, and treatment  Naive Bayes, a specialized AdaBoost algorithm, and      linear and polynomial support vector machines were applied to identify these      articles  MEASUREMENTS The machine learning models were compared in each category      with each other and with the clinical query filters using area under the receiver     operating characteristic curves, 11-point average recall precision, and a      sensitivity/specificity match method  RESULTS In most categories, the      data-induced models have better or comparable sensitivity, specificity, and      precision than the clinical query filters  The polynomial support vector machine       models perform the best among all learning methods in ranking the articles as      evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve and 11-point average recall       precision  CONCLUSION This research shows that, using machine learning methods,      it is possible to automatically build models for retrieving high-quality,      content-specific articles using inclusion or citation by the ACP Journal Club as       a gold standard in a given time period in internal medicine that perform better     than the 1994 PubMed clinical query filters

PMID- 15561788   - OBJECTIVE: Adverse events are poor health outcomes caused by medical care       Measuring them is necessary for quality improvements, but current detection      methods are inadequate  We performed this study to validate a previously derived       method of adverse event detection using term searching in physician-dictated      discharge summaries  DESIGN: This was a retrospective, chart review study of a      random sample of 245 adult medicine and surgery patients admitted to a      multicampus academic medical center in 2002  MEASUREMENTS: The authors used a      commercially available search engine to scan discharge summaries for the presence      of 104 terms that potentially indicate an adverse event  Summaries with any of      these terms were reviewed by a physician to determine the term's context       Screen-positive summaries had a term that was contextually indicative of an      adverse event  We used a two-stage chart review as the gold standard to determine      the true presence or absence of an adverse event  RESULTS: The average patient      age was 62 years  standard deviation 18 6  and 55% were admitted to a medical      service  By gold standard criteria, 48 of 245 patients had an adverse event  Term      searching classified 27 cases with an adverse event, with 11 true positives; 218       cases were classified as not having an adverse event, with 181 true negatives       The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were      0 23  95% confidence interval [CI]=0 11-0 35 , 0 92  95% CI=0 88-0 96 , 0 41  95%      CI=0 25-0 59 , and 0 83  95% CI=95% 0 77-0 97 , respectively  CONCLUSION:      Although the sensitivity of the method is low, its high specificity means that      the method could be used to replace expensive manual chart reviews by nurses

PMID- 15561787   - The authors describe a client-server approach to three-dimensional  3-D       visualization of neuroimaging data, which enables researchers to visualize,      manipulate, and analyze large brain imaging datasets over the Internet  All      computationally intensive tasks are done by a graphics server that loads and      processes image volumes and 3-D models, renders 3-D scenes, and sends the      renderings back to the client  The authors discuss the system architecture and      implementation and give several examples of client applications that allow      visualization and analysis of integrated language map data from single and      multiple patients

PMID- 15561786   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the patterns of e-Health use over a four-year period and      the characteristics of users  DESIGN: Longitudinal, population-based study       1999-2002  of members of a prepaid integrated delivery system  Available      e-Health services included ordering prescription drug refills, scheduling      appointments, and asking medical questions  MEASUREMENTS: Rates of known access      to e-Health services, and of e-Health use each quarter  RESULTS: The number of      members with known e-Health access increased from 51,336  1 6%  in 1999 to      324,522  9 3% , in 2002  The percentage of households in which at least one      person in the household had access increased from 2 7% to 14 1%  Among the      subjects with known access, the percentage of subjects that used e-Health at      least once increased from 25 7% in 1999 to 36 2% in 2002  In the multivariate      analysis, subjects who had a low expected clinical need, were nonwhite, or lived       in low socioeconomic status  SES  neighborhoods were less likely to have used      e-Health services in 2002  Disparities by race/ethnicity and SES persisted after       controlling for access to e-Health and widened over time  CONCLUSION: Access to      and use of e-Health services are growing rapidly  Use of these services appears      to be greatest among persons with more medical need  The majority of subjects,      however, do not use any e-Health services  More research is needed to determine      potential reasons for disparities in e-Health use by race/ethnicity and SES as      well as the implications of these disparities on clinical outcomes

PMID- 15561785   - BACKGROUND: The Secretary of Health and Human Services recently released a report      calling for the nation to create a national health information network  NHIN       that would interconnect Regional Health Information Organizations  RHIOs   These       RHIOs, which others have called Local or Regional Health Information      Infrastructures  LHII , would in turn interconnect local as well as national      health information resources  Little data exist about the activities taking place      in communities to create LHIIs  APPROACH: The authors analyzed data that      communities submitted in response to a request for capabilities issued by the      Foundation for eHealth as part of their Connecting Communities for Better Health       program using descriptive statistics and subjective evaluation  IMPRESSION: The      authors analyzed data from 134 responses from communities in 42 states and the      District of Columbia  Communities are enthusiastic about moving forward with      health information exchange to create LHIIs to improve the efficiency, quality,      and safety of care  They have identified significant local sources of investment       and plan to use some clinical data standards but not as broadly as was expected        The communities have not yet developed the specific technical approaches or the      sustainable business models that will be required  Many communities are      interested in creating an LHII and are developing the leadership commitment      needed to translate that interest into an operational reality  Clinical      information standards can be incorporated into a community's plans as often as      they need to be  Communities have to overcome funding issues, develop deeper     understanding of the technical and organizational issues, and aggressively share       their learning to succeed within their community and to help other communities      succeed

PMID- 15561783   - Consensus is growing that a health care information and communication      infrastructure is one key to fixing the crisis in the United States in health      care quality, cost, and access  The National Health Information Infrastructure       NHII  is an initiative of the Department of Health and Human Services receiving       bipartisan support  There are many possible courses toward its objective       Decision makers need to reflect carefully on which approaches are likely to work       on a large enough scale to have the intended beneficial national impacts and      which are better left to smaller projects within the boundaries of health care      organizations  This report provides a primer for use by informatics professionals      as they explain aspects of that dividing line to policy makers and to health care      leaders and front-line providers  It then identifies short-term, intermediate,      and long-term steps that might be taken by the NHII initiative

PMID- 15561782   - This report reviews some of the extensive literature in health literacy, much of       it focused on the intersection of low literacy and the understanding of basic      health care information  Several articles describe methods for assessing health      literacy as well as methods for assessing the readability of texts, although      generally these latter have not been developed with health materials in mind       Other studies have looked more closely at the mismatch between patients' literacy      levels and the readability of materials intended for use by those patients  A      number of studies have investigated the phenomenon of literacy from the      perspective of patients' interactions in the health care setting, the      disenfranchisement of some patients because of their low literacy skills, the      difficulty some patients have in navigating the health care system, the quality      of the communication between doctors and their patients including the cultural      overlay of such exchanges, and ultimately the effect of low literacy on health      outcomes  Finally, the impact of new information technologies has been studied by      a number of investigators  There remain many opportunities for conducting further     research to gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between      general literacy, health literacy, information technologies, and the existing      health care infrastructure

PMID- 15492038   - OBJECTIVE: To model the temporal information contained in medical narrative      reports as a simple temporal constraint satisfaction problem  DESIGN: A      constraint satisfaction problem is defined by time points and constraints       inequalities between points   A time interval comprises a pair of points and a      constraint  Five complete electronic discharge summaries and paragraphs from 226       other discharge summaries were studied  Medical events were represented as      intervals, and assertions about events were represented as constraints  Through a      consensus process, a set of encoding procedures and a list of issues related to      encoding were generated  MEASUREMENTS: Instances of temporal disjunction and      contradiction and distribution of temporal constraints were used  RESULTS: An      average of 95 medical events  range, 46-151  and 234 temporal assertions  range,       118-388  were identified per complete discharge summary  Nondefinitional      assertions were explicit  36%  or implicit  64%  and absolute  17% , qualitative        72% , or metric  11%   Implicit assertions were based on domain knowledge and      assumptions, e g , the section of the report determined the ordering of events       Issues included linking events, intermittence, periodicity, granularity,      vagueness, ambiguity, uncertainty, and plans  ions such as intermittence were not      represented explicitly  The temporal network was sparse: Only 0 80%  range,      0 42%-1 38%  of possible constraints were instantiated  No instances of      discontinuous temporal disjunction were found in the complete summaries or the      226 paragraphs  One instance of temporal contradiction was found  intrareport      rate of 0 2 with a 95% confidence interval of 0 005-1 114   CONCLUSION: A simple       temporal constraint satisfaction problem appears sufficient to represent most      temporal assertions in discharge summaries and may be useful for encoding      electronic medical records

PMID- 15492037   - The Digital Anatomist Foundational Model of Anatomy  FMA  is a large semantic      network of more than 100,000 terms that refer to the anatomical entities, which      together with 1 6 million structural relationships symbolically represent the      physical organization of the human body  Evaluation of such a large knowledge      base by domain experts is challenging because of the sheer size of the resource      and the need to evaluate not just classes but also relationships  To meet this      challenge, the authors have developed a relation-centric query interface, called       Emily, that is able to query the entire range of classes and relationships in the      FMA, yet is simple to use by a domain expert  Formative evaluation of this      interface considered the ability of Emily to formulate queries based on standard       anatomy examination questions, as well as the processing speed of the query      engine  Results show that Emily is able to express 90% of the examination      questions submitted to it and that processing time is generally 1 second or less,      but can be much longer for complex queries  These results suggest that Emily will      be a very useful tool, not only for evaluating the FMA, but also for querying and      evaluating other large semantic networks

PMID- 15492036   - The Georgetown University Medical Center Department of Radiology used a tailored       version of OCTAVE, a self-directed information security risk assessment method,      to design a teleradiology system that complied with the regulation implementing      the security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability      Act  HIPAA  of 1996  The system addressed threats to and vulnerabilities in the      privacy and security of protected health information  By using OCTAVE, Georgetown      identified the teleradiology program's critical assets, described threats to the       assurance of those assets, developed and ran vulnerability scans of a system      pilot, evaluated the consequences of security breaches, and developed a risk      management plan to mitigate threats to program assets, thereby implementing good       information assurance practices  This case study illustrates the basic point that      prospective, comprehensive planning to protect the privacy and security of an      information system strategically benefits program management as well as system      security

PMID- 15492035   - OBJECTIVE: This multisite study compared the perceptions of three stakeholder     groups regarding information technologies as barriers to and facilitators of      clinical practice guidelines  CPGs   DESIGN: The study settings were 18 U S       Veterans Affairs Medical Centers  A purposive sample of 322 individuals      participated in 50 focus groups segmented by profession and included      administrators, physicians, and nurses  Focus group participants were selected      based on their knowledge of practice guidelines and involvement in facility-wide       guideline implementation  MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive content analysis of 1,500      pages of focus group transcripts  RESULTS: Eighteen themes clustered into four     domains  Stakeholders were similar in discussing themes in the computer function       domain most frequently but divergent in other domains, with workplace factors      more often discussed by administrators, system design issues discussed most by      nurses, and personal concerns discussed by physicians and nurses  Physicians and       nurses most often discussed barriers, whereas administrators focused most often      on facilitation  Facilitators included guideline maintenance and charting      formats  Barriers included resources, attitudes, time and workload, computer     glitches, computer complaints, data retrieval, and order entry  Themes with dual       designations included documentation, patient records, decision support,      performance evaluation, CPG implementation, computer literacy, essential data,      and computer accessibility  CONCLUSION: Stakeholders share many concerns      regarding the relationships between information technologies and clinical      guideline use  However, administrators, physicians, and nurses hold different      opinions about specific facilitators and barriers  Health professionals'      disparate perceptions could undermine guideline initiatives  Implementation plans      should specifically incorporate actions to address these barriers and enhance the      facilitative aspects of information technologies in clinical practice guideline      use

PMID- 15492034   - In this paper, the authors describe a methodology to transform programmatically      structured reporting  SR  templates defined by the Digital Imaging and      Communications for Medicine  DICOM  standard into an XML schema representation       Such schemas can be used in the creation and validation of XML-encoded SR     documents that use templates  Templates are a means to put additional constraints      on an SR document to promote common formats for specific reporting applications      or domains  As the use of templates becomes more widespread in the production of       SR documents, it is important to ensure validity of such documents  The work      described in this paper is an extension of the authors' previous work on XML      schema representation for DICOM SR  Therefore, this paper inherits and partially       modifies the structure defined in the earlier work

PMID- 15492033   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the costs of implementing      computerized physician order entry  CPOE  systems in hospitals in a rural state      and to evaluate the financial implications of statewide CPOE implementation       METHODS: A simulation model was constructed using estimates of initial and      ongoing CPOE costs mapped onto all general hospitals in Iowa by bed quantity and       current clinical information system  CIS  status  CPOE cost estimates were      obtained from a leading CPOE vendor  Current CIS status was determined through      mail survey of Iowa hospitals  Patient care revenue and operating cost data      published by the Iowa Hospital Association were used to simulate the financial      impact of CPOE adoption on hospitals  RESULTS: CPOE implementation would      dramatically increase operating costs for rural and critical access hospitals in       the absence of substantial costs savings associated with improved efficiency or     improved patient safety  For urban and rural referral hospitals, the cost impact       is less dramatic but still substantial  However, relatively modest benefits in      the form of patient care cost savings or revenue enhancement would be sufficient       to offset CPOE costs for these larger hospitals  CONCLUSION: Implementation of      CPOE in rural or critical access hospitals may depend on net increase in      operating costs  Adoption of CPOE may be financially infeasible for these small      hospitals in the absence of increases in hospital payments or ongoing subsidies      from third parties

PMID- 15492032   - The rapid advances in high-throughput biotechnologies such as DNA microarrays and      mass spectrometry have generated vast amounts of data ranging from gene      expression to proteomics data  The large size and complexity involved in      analyzing such data demand a significant amount of computing power       High-performance computation  HPC  is an attractive and increasingly affordable      approach to help meet this challenge  There is a spectrum of techniques that can       be used to achieve computational speedup with varying degrees of impact in terms       of how drastic a change is required to allow the software to run on an HPC      platform  This paper describes a high- productivity/low-maintenance  HP/LM       approach to HPC that is based on establishing a collaborative relationship      between the bioinformaticist and HPC expert that respects the former's codes and       minimizes the latter's efforts  The goal of this approach is to make it easy for       bioinformatics researchers to continue to make iterative refinements to their     programs, while still being able to take advantage of HPC  The paper describes      our experience applying these HP/LM techniques in four bioinformatics case      studies:  1  genome-wide sequence comparison using Blast,  2  identification of      biomarkers based on statistical analysis of large mass spectrometry data sets,       3  complex genetic analysis involving ordinal phenotypes,  4  large-scale      assessment of the effect of possible errors in analyzing microarray data  The      case studies illustrate how the HP/LM approach can be applied to a range of      representative bioinformatics applications and how the approach can lead to      significant speedup of computationally intensive bioinformatics applications,      while making only modest modifications to the programs themselves

PMID- 15492030   - The incorporation of genomic data into personal medical records poses many      challenges to patient privacy  In response, various systems for preserving      patient privacy in shared genomic data have been developed and deployed  Although      these systems de-identify the data by removing explicit identifiers  e g , name,       address, or Social Security number  and incorporate sound security design      principles, they suffer from a lack of formal modeling of inferences learnable      from shared data  This report evaluates the extent to which current protection      systems are capable of withstanding a range of re-identification methods,      including genotype-phenotype inferences, location-visit patterns, family      structures, and dictionary attacks  For a comparative re-identification analysis,      the systems are mapped to a common formalism  Although there is variation in      susceptibility, each system is deficient in its protection capacity  The author     discovers patterns of protection failure and discusses several of the reasons why      these systems are susceptible  The analyses and discussion within provide      guideposts for the development of next-generation protection methods amenable to       formal proofs

PMID- 15492029   - For over thirty years, there have been predictions that the widespread clinical      use of computers was imminent  Yet the "wave" has never broken  In this article,       two broad time periods are examined: the 1960's to the 1980's and the 1980's to      the present  Technology immaturity, health administrator focus on financial      systems, application "unfriendliness," and physician resistance were all barriers      to acceptance during the early time period  Although these factors persist,      changes in clinicians' economics, more computer literacy in the general      population, and, most importantly, changes in government policies and increased      support for clinical computing suggest that the wave may break in the next      decade

PMID- 15492028   - Despite growing support for the adoption of electronic health records  EHR  to      improve U S  healthcare delivery, EHR adoption in the United States is slow to      date due to a fundamental failure of the healthcare information technology      marketplace  Reasons for the slow adoption of healthcare information technology      include a misalignment of incentives, limited purchasing power among providers,      variability in the viability of EHR products and companies, and limited      demonstrated value of EHRs in practice  At the 2004 American College of Medical      Informatics  ACMI  Retreat, attendees discussed the current state of EHR adoption      in this country and identified steps that could be taken to stimulate adoption       In this paper, based upon the ACMI retreat, and building upon the experiences of       the authors developing EHR in academic and commercial settings we identify a set       of recommendations to stimulate adoption of EHR, including financial incentives,       promotion of EHR standards, enabling policy, and educational, marketing, and      supporting activities for both the provider community and healthcare consumers

PMID- 15299001   - OBJECTIVE: Patient access to their electronic health care record  EHR  and      Web-based communication between patients and providers can potentially improve      the quality of health care, but little is known about patients' attitudes toward       this combined electronic access  The objective of our study was to evaluate      patients' values and perceptions regarding Web-based communication with their     primary care providers in the context of access to their electronic health care      record  METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 4,282 members of the Geisinger       Health System who are registered users of an application  MyChart  that allows      patients to communicate electronically with their providers and view selected      portions of their EHR  To supplement the survey, we also conducted focus groups      with 25 patients who were using the system and conducted one-on-one interviews      with ten primary care clinicians  We collected and analyzed data on user     satisfaction, ease of use, communication preferences, and the completeness and      accuracy of the patient EHR  RESULTS: A total of 4,282 registered patient EHR     users were invited to participate in the survey; 1,421 users  33%  completed the       survey, 60% of them female  The age distribution of users was as follows: 18 to      30  5% , 31 to 45  24% , 46 to 64  54% , 65 and older  16%   Using a continuous      scale from 1 to 100, the majority of users indicated that the system was easy to       use  mean scores ranged from 78 to 85  and that their medical record information       was complete, accurate, and understandable  mean scores ranged from 65 to 85        Only a minority of users was concerned about the confidentiality of their     information or about seeing abnormal test results after receiving only an      explanatory electronic message from their provider  Patients preferred e-mail      communication for some interactions  e g , requesting prescription renewals,      obtaining general medical information , whereas they preferred in-person      communication for others  e g , getting treatment instructions   Telephone or     written communication was never their preferred communication channel  In      contrast, physicians were more likely to prefer telephone communication and less       likely to prefer e-mail communication  CONCLUSION: Patients' attitudes about the       use of Web messaging and online access to their EHR were mostly positive       Patients were satisfied that their medical information was complete and accurate       A minority of patients was mildly concerned about the confidentiality and privacy      of their information and about learning of abnormal test results electronically        Clinicians were less positive about using electronic communication than their     patients  Patients and clinicians differed substantially regarding their     preferred means of communication for different types of interactions

PMID- 15299000   - OBJECTIVE: To examine various strategies for the identification of adverse drug      events  ADEs  among older persons in the ambulatory clinical setting  DESIGN: A      cohort study of Medicare enrollees  n = 31,757 per month  receiving medical care       from a large multispecialty group practice during a 12-month observation period       July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000   MEASUREMENTS: Possible drug-related      incidents occurring in the ambulatory clinical setting were detected using      signals from multiple sources  RESULTS: During the tracking period, there were      1,523 identified ADEs, of which 421  28%  were considered preventable  Across all      sources, 23,917 signals were found; 12,791  53%  were potential incidents that      led to review of a patient's medical record and 2,266  9%  were presented to      physician reviewers  Although the positive predictive value  PPV  for reports      from providers was high compared with other sources  54% , only 11% of the ADEs      and 6% of the preventable ADEs were identified through this source  PPVs for     other sources ranged from a low of 4% for administrative incident reports to a      high of 12% for free-text review of electronic notes  Computer-generated signals       were the source for 31% of the ADEs and 37% of the preventable ADEs  Electronic      notes were the source for 39% of the ADEs and 29% of the preventable ADEs  There       was little overlap in the ADEs identified across all sources  CONCLUSION: Our     findings emphasize the limitations of voluntary reporting by health care      providers as the principal means for detection of ADEs and suggest that multiple       strategies are required to detect ADEs in geriatric ambulatory patients

PMID- 15298999   - The authors report on the development and evaluation of a novel patient-centered       technology that promotes capture of critical information necessary to drive      guideline-based care for pediatric asthma  The design of this application, the      asthma kiosk, addresses five critical issues for patient-centered technology that      promotes guideline-based care:  1  a front-end mechanism for patient-driven data       capture,  2  neutrality regarding patients' medical expertise and technical      backgrounds,  3  granular capture of medication data directly from the patient,       4  formal algorithms linking patient-level semantics and asthma guidelines, and        5  output to both patients and clinical providers regarding best practice  The      formative evaluation of the asthma kiosk demonstrates its ability to capture      patient-specific data during real-time care in the emergency department  ED  with      a mean completion time of 11 minutes  The asthma kiosk successfully links      parents' data to guideline recommendations and identifies data critical to health      improvements for asthmatic children that otherwise remains undocumented during      ED-based care

PMID- 15298998   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine characteristics of drug allergy      alert overrides, assess how often they lead to preventable adverse drug events       ADEs , and suggest methods for improving the allergy-alerting system  DESIGN:      Chart review was performed on a stratified random subset of all allergy alerts      occurring during a 3-month period  August through October 2002  at a large      academic hospital  MEASUREMENTS: Factors that were measured were drug/allergy      combinations that triggered alerts, frequency of specific override reasons,      characteristics of ADEs, and completeness of allergy documentation  RESULTS: A      total of 6,182  80%  of 7,761 alerts were overridden in 1,150 patients  In this      sample, only 10% of alerts were triggered by an exact match between the drug      ordered and allergy listed  Physicians' most common reasons for overriding alerts      were "Aware/Will monitor"  55% , "Patient does not have this allergy/tolerates"       33% , and "Patient taking already"  10%   In a stratified random subset of 320      patients  28% of 1,150  on chart review, 19  6%  experienced ADEs attributed to      the overridden drug; of these, 9  47%  were serious  None of the ADEs was      considered preventable, because the overrides were deemed clinically justifiable       The degree of completeness of patients' allergy lists was highly variable and      generally low in both paper charts and the CPOE system  CONCLUSION: Overrides of       drug-allergy alerts were common and about 1 in 20 resulted in ADEs, but all of      the overrides resulting in ADEs appeared clinically justifiable  The high rate of      alert overrides was attributable to frequent nonexact match alerts and infrequent      updating of allergy lists  Based on these findings, we have made specific      recommendations for increasing the specificity of alerting and thereby improving       the clinical utility of the drug allergy alerting system

PMID- 15298997   - The authors have developed the Genetics Home Reference, a consumer resource that       addresses the health implications of the Human Genome Project  The research      results made possible by the Human Genome Project are being made available      increasingly in scientific databases on the Internet, but, because of the often      highly technical nature of these databases, they are not readily accessible to      the lay public  The authors' goal is to provide a bridge between the clinical      questions of the public and the richness of the data emanating from the Human      Genome Project  The Genetics Home Reference currently focuses on single gene or     polygenic conditions that are also topics on MEDLINEplus, the National Library of      Medicine's primary consumer health site  As knowledge of genetics expands, the      interrelationships between genes and diseases will continue to unfold, and the      site will reflect these developments

PMID- 15298995   - Query Integrator System  QIS  is a database mediator framework intended to      address robust data integration from continuously changing heterogeneous data      sources in the biosciences  Currently in the advanced prototype stage, it is      being used on a production basis to integrate data from neuroscience databases      developed for the SenseLab project at Yale University with external neuroscience       and genomics databases  The QIS framework uses standard technologies and is      intended to be deployable by administrators with a moderate level of      technological expertise: It comes with various tools, such as interfaces for the       design of distributed queries  The QIS architecture is based on a set of      distributed network-based servers, data source servers, integration servers, and       ontology servers, that exchange metadata as well as mappings of both metadata and      data elements to elements in an ontology  Metadata version difference      determination coupled with decomposition of stored queries is used as the basis      for partial query recovery when the schema of data sources alters

PMID- 15298994   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the      feasibility of using a generic health measure to create coded functional status      indicators and compare the characterization of a stroke population using coded      functional indicators and using health-related quality-of-life summary measures      alone  DESIGN: Multiple raters assigned International Classification of      Functioning, Disability, and Health  ICF  codes to the items of the 12-Item Short      Form Health Survey  SF-12   Data for comparing the information from the SF-12 and      from ICF codes were derived from the Montreal Stroke Cohort Study that was set up      to examine the long-term impact of stroke  Available for analysis were data from       604 persons with stroke, average age 69 years, and 488 controls, average age 62      years  MEASUREMENT: The SF-12 provides two summary scores, one for physical      health and one for mental health  Domains of the ICF are coded to three digits,      before the decimal; specific categorizations of impairments, activity      limitations, and participation restrictions are coded to four digits before the      decimal  RESULTS: Persons with stroke scored, on average, approximately 10 points      lower than controls on physical and mental health  The ICF coding indicated that       this was attributed, not surprisingly, to greater difficulty in doing moderate      activities including housework, climbing stairs, and working and was not      attributed to differences in pain  Differences in mental health were attributed      most strongly to greater fatigue  impairment in energy , but all areas of mental       health were affected to some degree  CONCLUSION: The ICF coding provided enhanced      functional status information in a format compatible with the structure of      administrative health databases

PMID- 15298993   - OBJECTIVE: To survey a cross section of patients presenting to three urban      primary care clinics to understand online health information search behaviors       DESIGN AND ANALYSIS: At three urban primary care clinics affiliated with      University at Buffalo, School of Medicine, 315 patients were interviewed       Interview questions included items on education, demographic information,      employment, number of current prescriptions, insurance, online access, and      specifics of health-searching behaviors  Chart review determined patient body      mass index and number of chronic illnesses  Logistic regression and chi2      statistics were used to investigate the relationship between patient      characteristics and the proportion of patients who use the Web for seeking health      information  RESULTS: Approximately 53% of respondents reported using Web or     e-mail in the past year and 68%  33% of total sample  of those who accessed the      Web used it to search for health information  The two most commonly cited search       areas included information about a physical illness and nutrition/fitness       Education and race significantly predicted online health-seeking behavior when      considering all factors in the study  Many patients  22%  relied on friends and      family to navigate the Web, and 45% of patients reported that the information      that they sought was unrelated to their clinical visit  CONCLUSION: Current use      of the Internet for health information was limited among more disadvantaged      patient groups  More research is needed to examine the relationship between      health-seeking behavior and patients' management of their health and well-being

PMID- 15298992   - Recent reports have identified medical errors as a significant cause of morbidity      and mortality among patients  A variety of approaches have been implemented to      identify errors and their causes  These approaches include retrospective      reporting and investigation of errors and adverse events and prospective analyses      for identifying hazardous situations  The above approaches, along with other     sources, contribute to data that are used to analyze patient safety risks  A      variety of data structures and terminologies have been created to represent the      information contained in these sources of patient safety data  Whereas many      representations may be well suited to the particular safety application for which      they were developed, such application-specific and often organization-specific      representations limit the sharability of patient safety data  The result is that       aggregation and comparison of safety data across organizations, practice domains,      and applications is difficult at best  A common reference data model and a      broadly applicable terminology for patient safety data are needed to aggregate      safety data at the regional and national level and conduct large-scale studies of      patient safety risks and interventions

PMID- 15187075   - BACKGROUND: Improving the safety, quality, and efficiency of health care will      require immediate and ubiquitous access to complete patient information and      decision support provided through a National Health Information Infrastructure       NHII   METHODS: To help define the action steps needed to achieve an NHII, the      U S  Department of Health and Human Services sponsored a national consensus      conference in July 2003  RESULTS: Attendees favored a public-private coordination      group to guide NHII activities, provide education, share resources, and monitor     relevant metrics to mark progress  They identified financial incentives, health      information standards, and overcoming a few important legal obstacles as key NHII      enablers  Community and regional implementation projects, including consumer     access to a personal health record, were seen as necessary to demonstrate      comprehensive functional systems that can serve as models for the entire nation        Finally, the participants identified the need for increased funding for research       on the impact of health information technology on patient safety and quality of      care  Individuals, organizations, and federal agencies are using these consensus       recommendations to guide NHII efforts

PMID- 15187074   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the experiences of patients and       physicians in a clinical trial of an online electronic medical record  SPPARO,      System Providing Patients Access to Records Online   DESIGN: Quantitative data      were obtained from questionnaires  Qualitative data were obtained from individual      interviews and focus groups  MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaire items were based on      issues identified by patients and physicians in previous studies  Individual      interviews and focus groups were performed using a semistructured format      developed through an iterative process  RESULTS: Of the eight physicians who      participated in the trial, seven completed questionnaires and interviews  Of the       394 patients in the practice, 107 enrolled in the study, and 54 were assigned      randomly to the intervention group  Of these, 41 used SPPARO during the trial      period  In questionnaires and interviews, patients were significantly more likely      than physicians to anticipate benefits of SPPARO and less likely to anticipate      problems  Attitudes of subjects did not diverge from controls after the      intervention period  In posttrial focus groups, SPPARO users described its      practical benefits  Comprehending medical jargon was a minor obstacle  Physicians      anticipated that implementing SPPARO might increase their workload and distort      their clinical interactions  In posttrial interviews, physicians and staff      reported no change in their workload and no adverse consequences  All of the      physicians ultimately supported the concept of giving patients online access to      their clinical notes and test results  CONCLUSION: SPPARO was useful for a number     of patients  Physicians initially voiced a number of concerns about implementing       SPPARO, but their experience with it was far more positive

PMID- 15187070   - In highly functional metadata-driven software, the interrelationships within the       metadata become complex, and maintenance becomes challenging  We describe an      approach to metadata management that uses a knowledge-base subschema to store      centralized information about metadata dependencies and use cases involving      specific types of metadata modification  Our system borrows ideas from      production-rule systems in that some of this information is a high-level      specification that is interpreted and executed dynamically by a middleware      engine  Our approach is implemented in TrialDB, a generic clinical study data      management system  We review approaches that have been used for metadata      management in other contexts and describe the features, capabilities, and      limitations of our system

PMID- 15187068   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a method based on natural      language processing  NLP  that automatically maps an entire clinical document to       codes with modifiers and to quantitatively evaluate the method  METHODS: An      existing NLP system, MedLEE, was adapted to automatically generate codes  The      method involves matching of structured output generated by MedLEE consisting of      findings and modifiers to obtain the most specific code  Recall and precision      applied to Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  coding were evaluated in two      separate studies  Recall was measured using a test set of 150 randomly selected      sentences, which were processed using MedLEE  Results were compared with a      reference standard determined manually by seven experts  Precision was measured      using a second test set of 150 randomly selected sentences from which UMLS codes       were automatically generated by the method and then validated by experts       RESULTS: Recall of the system for UMLS coding of all terms was  77  95%      CI 72- 81 , and for coding terms that had corresponding UMLS codes recall was  83        79- 87   Recall of the system for extracting all terms was  84   81- 88        Recall of the experts ranged from  69 to  91 for extracting terms  The precision       of the system was  89   87- 91 , and precision of the experts ranged from  61 to        91  CONCLUSION: Extraction of relevant clinical information and UMLS coding were      accomplished using a method based on NLP  The method appeared to be comparable to      or better than six experts  The advantage of the method is that it maps text to      codes along with other related information, rendering the coded output suitable      for effective retrieval

PMID- 15187067   - Monitoring vaccination activity requires regular access to information about      patient vaccination status  This report describes our experience using multiple      Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  data sources to determine availability and      completeness of vaccination information for veterans with spinal cord injuries      and disorders  SCI&D   Administrative and clinical databases were limited to      coding vaccine administration, undercounted vaccinations, and were unable to      account for whether the vaccine was offered and the reasons for nonreceipt       Medical record review provided more detail but was labor intensive and costly       Patient surveys provided the richest information but were costly, time-consuming,      and based on a sample of patients  Agreement was poor between data sources  This       report suggests that while VA is well positioned to use national databases for     clinical care decisions and to inform policy, vaccination data were incomplete       Electronic records must include data that are consistently entered and validated       before they can be useful for care management and decision making

PMID- 15187064   - Information technology can support the implementation of clinical research      findings in practice settings  Technology can address the quality gap in health      care by providing automated decision support to clinicians that integrates      guideline knowledge with electronic patient data to present real-time,      patient-specific recommendations  However, technical success in implementing      decision support systems may not translate directly into system use by      clinicians  Successful technology integration into clinical work settings      requires explicit attention to the organizational context  We describe the      application of a "sociotechnical" approach to integration of ATHENA DSS, a      decision support system for the treatment of hypertension, into geographically      dispersed primary care clinics  We applied an iterative technical design in      response to organizational input and obtained ongoing endorsements of the project      by the organization's administrative and clinical leadership  Conscious attention      to organizational context at the time of development, deployment, and maintenance      of the system was associated with extensive clinician use of the system

PMID- 15187061   - OBJECTIVE: A gap exists between the information contained in published clinical      practice guidelines and the knowledge and information that are necessary to      implement them  This work describes a process to systematize and make explicit      the translation of document-based knowledge into workflow-integrated clinical      decision support systems  DESIGN: This approach uses the Guideline Elements Model       GEM  to represent the guideline knowledge  Implementation requires a number of      steps to translate the knowledge contained in guideline text into a computable      format and to integrate the information into clinical workflow  The steps      include:  1  selection of a guideline and specific recommendations for     implementation,  2  markup of the guideline text,  3  atomization,  4       deabstraction and  5  disambiguation of recommendation concepts,  6  verification      of rule set completeness,  7  addition of explanations,  8  building executable      statements,  9  specification of origins of decision variables and insertions of       recommended actions,  10  definition of action types and selection of associated       beneficial services,  11  choice of interface components, and  12  creation of      requirement specification  RESULTS: The authors illustrate these component      processes using examples drawn from recent experience translating recommendations      from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's guideline on management of      chronic asthma into a workflow-integrated decision support system that operates      within the Logician electronic health record system  CONCLUSION: Using the      guideline document as a knowledge source promotes authentic translation of domain      knowledge and reduces the overall complexity of the implementation task  From      this framework, we believe that a better understanding of activities involved in       guideline implementation will emerge

PMID- 15064295   - OBJECTIVE: E-mail use in the clinical setting has been slow to diffuse for     several reasons, including providers' concerns about patients' inappropriate and       inefficient use of the technology  This study examined the content of a random      sample of patient-physician e-mail messages to determine the validity of those      concerns  DESIGN: A qualitative analysis of patient-physician e-mail messages was      performed  MEASUREMENTS: A total of 3,007 patient-physician e-mail messages were       collected over 11 months as part of a randomized, controlled trial of a      triage-based e-mail system in two primary care centers  including 98 physicians ;      10% of messages were randomly selected for review  Messages were coded across      such domains as message type, number of requests per e-mail, inclusion of      sensitive content, necessity of a physician response, and message tone  RESULTS:       The majority  82 8%  of messages addressed a single issue  The most common      message types included information updates to the physicians  41 4% ,      prescription renewals  24 2% , health questions  13 2% , questions about test      results  10 9% , referrals  8 8% , "other"  including thank yous, apologies        8 8% , appointments  5 4% , requests for non-health-related information  4 8% ,       and billing questions  0 3%   Overall, messages were concise, formal, and      medically relevant  Very few  5 1%  included sensitive content, and none included      urgent messages  Less than half  43 2%  required a physician response       CONCLUSION: A triage-based e-mail system promoted e-mail exchanges appropriate      for primary care  Most patients adhered to guidelines aimed at focusing content,       limiting the number of requests per message, and avoiding urgent requests or     highly sensitive content  Thus, physicians' concerns about the content of      patients' e-mails may be unwarranted

PMID- 15064294   - This report describes XDesc  eXperiment Description , a pilot project that serves      as a case study exploring the degree to which an informatics capability developed      in a clinical application can be ported for use in the biosciences  In      particular, XDesc uses the Entity-Attribute-Value database implementation       including a great deal of metadata-based functionality  developed in TrialDB, a       clinical research database, for use in describing the samples used in microarray       experiments stored in the Yale Microarray Database  YMD   XDesc was linked      successfully to both TrialDB and YMD, and was used to describe the data in three       different microarray research projects involving Drosophila  In the process, a      number of new desirable capabilities were identified in the bioscience domain       These were implemented on a pilot basis in XDesc, and subsequently "folded back"       into TrialDB itself, enhancing its capabilities for dealing with clinical data       This case study provides a concrete example of how informatics research and      development in clinical and bioscience domains has the potential for synergy and       for cross-fertilization

PMID- 15064293   - Care providers' adoption of computer-based health-related documentation  "note      capture"  tools has been limited, even though such tools have the potential to      facilitate information gathering and to promote efficiency of clinical charting        The authors have developed and deployed a computerized note-capture tool that has      been made available to end users through a care provider order entry  CPOE       system already in wide use at Vanderbilt  Overall note-capture tool usage between      January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001, increased substantially, both in the      number of users and in their frequency of use  This case report is provided as an      example of how an existing care provider order entry environment can facilitate      clinical end-user adoption of a computer-assisted documentation tool-a concept      that may seem counterintuitive to some

PMID- 15064291   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether an automated e-mail      messaging system that sent individually timed educational messages  ITEMs       increased the effectiveness of an Internet smoking cessation intervention       DESIGN: Using two consecutive series of participants, the authors compared two      Web-based self-help style smoking cessation interventions: a single-point-in-time      educational intervention and an enhanced intervention that also sent ITEMs timed       to participants' quit efforts  Outcomes were compared in 199 participants      receiving the one-time intervention and 286 receiving ITEMs  MEASUREMENTS:      Demographic factors, number of cigarettes smoked, nicotine addiction, depressive       symptoms, and confidence in ability to quit were measured at entry       Twenty-four-hour quit attempts and seven-day point-prevalence of abstinence       nonrespondents assumed to smoke  were measured 30 days after each subject's      self-selected quit date  RESULTS: The one-time and ITEMs groups differed in some       demographics and some relapse risk factors but not in factors associated with      30-day quit rates  ITEMs appeared to increase the rate at which individuals set      quit dates  97% vs  91%, p = 0 005  and, among the respondents to follow-up      questionnaires  n = 145 , the rate of reported 24-hour quit efforts  83% vs  54%,      p = 0 001   The 30-day intent-to-treat quit rates were higher in the ITEMs group:      7 5% vs  13 6%, p = 0 035  In multivariate analyses controlling for differences      between groups, receiving ITEMs was associated with an increase in the odds ratio      for quitting of 2 6  95% confidence interval = 1 3-5 3   CONCLUSION: ITEMs sent      on strategic days in smokers' quit efforts enhanced early success with smoking      cessation relative to a single-point-in-time Web intervention  The effect appears      to be mediated by ITEMs' causing smokers to plan and undertake quit efforts more       frequently

PMID- 15064290   - OBJECTIVE: Health care providers are beginning to deliver a range of      Internet-based services to patients; however, it is not clear which of these      e-health services patients need or desire  The authors propose that patients'      acceptance of provider-delivered e-health can be modeled in advance of      application development by measuring the effects of several key antecedents to      e-health use and applying models of acceptance developed in the information      technology  IT  field  DESIGN: This study tested three theoretical models of IT      acceptance among patients who had recently registered for access to      provider-delivered e-health  MEASUREMENTS: An online questionnaire administered      items measuring perceptual constructs from the IT acceptance models  intrinsic      motivation, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness/extrinsic motivation, and      behavioral intention to use e-health  and five hypothesized antecedents       satisfaction with medical care, health care knowledge, Internet dependence,      information-seeking preference, and health care need   Responses were collected      and stored in a central database  RESULTS: All tested IT acceptance models      performed well in predicting patients' behavioral intention to use e-health       Antecedent factors of satisfaction with provider, information-seeking preference,      and Internet dependence uniquely predicted constructs in the models  CONCLUSION:       Information technology acceptance models provide a means to understand which      aspects of e-health are valued by patients and how this may affect future use  In      addition, antecedents to the models can be used to predict e-health acceptance in      advance of system development

PMID- 15064287   - OBJECTIVE: Computerized physician documentation  CPD  has been implemented      throughout the nation's Veterans Affairs Medical Centers  VAMCs  and is likely to      increasingly replace handwritten documentation in other institutions  The use of       this technology may affect educational and clinical activities, yet little has      been reported in this regard  The authors conducted a qualitative study to      determine the perceived impacts of CPD among faculty and housestaff in a VAMC       DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted using semistructured interviews      with faculty  n = 10  and a group interview with residents  n = 10  at a VAMC      teaching hospital  MEASUREMENTS: Content analysis of field notes and taped      transcripts were done by two independent reviewers using a grounded theory      approach  Findings were validated using member checking and peer debriefing       RESULTS: Four major themes were identified:  1  improved availability of      documentation;  2  changes in work processes and communication;  3  alterations      in document structure and content; and  4  mistakes, concerns, and decreased      confidence in the data  With a few exceptions, subjects felt documentation was      more available, with benefits for education and patient care  Other impacts of      CPD were largely seen as detrimental to aspects of clinical practice and      education, including documentation quality, workflow, professional communication,      and patient care  CONCLUSION: CPD is perceived to have substantial positive and      negative impacts on clinical and educational activities and environments  Care      should be taken when designing, implementing, and using such systems to avoid or       minimize any harmful impacts  More research is needed to assess the extent of the      impacts identified and to determine the best strategies to effectively deal with       them

PMID- 15064284   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate relations among different      aspects in supervised word sense disambiguation  WSD; supervised machine learning      for disambiguating the sense of a term in a context  and compare supervised WSD      in the biomedical domain with that in the general English domain  METHODS: The      study involves three data sets  a biomedical abbreviation data set, a general      biomedical term data set, and a general English data set   The authors      implemented three machine-learning algorithms, including  1  naive Bayes  NBL       and decision lists  TDLL ,  2  their adaptation of decision lists  ODLL , and  3       their mixed supervised learning  MSL   There were six feature representations       various combinations of collocations, bag of words, oriented bag of words, etc        and five window sizes  2, 4, 6, 8, and 10   RESULTS: Supervised WSD is suitable      only when there are enough sense-tagged instances with at least a few dozens of      instances for each sense  Collocations combined with neighboring words are      appropriate selections for the context  For terms with unrelated biomedical      senses, a large window size such as the whole paragraph should be used, while for     general English words a moderate window size between 4 and 10 should be used  The      performance of the authors' implementation of decision list classifiers for     abbreviations was better than that of traditional decision list classifiers       However, the opposite held for the other two sets  Also, the authors' mixed      supervised learning was stable and generally better than others for all sets       CONCLUSION: From this study, it was found that different aspects of supervised      WSD depend on each other  The experiment method presented in the study can be      used to select the best supervised WSD classifier for each ambiguous term

PMID- 14764617   - In 2002-2003, the American College of Medical Informatics  ACMI  undertook a      study of the future of informatics training  This project capitalized on the      rapidly expanding interest in the role of computation in basic biological      research, well characterized in the National Institutes of Health  NIH       Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative  BISTI  report  The      defining activity of the project was the three-day 2002 Annual Symposium of the      College  A committee, comprised of the authors of this report, subsequently      carried out activities, including interviews with a broader informatics and      biological sciences constituency, collation and categorization of observations,      and generation of recommendations  The committee viewed biomedical informatics as      an interdisciplinary field, combining basic informational and computational      sciences with application domains, including health care, biological research,      and education  Consequently, effective training in informatics, viewed from a      national perspective, should encompass four key elements:  1   curricula that      integrate experiences in the computational sciences and application domains      rather than just concatenating them;  2   diversity among trainees, with      individualized, interdisciplinary cross-training allowing each trainee to develop      key competencies that he or she does not initially possess;  3   direct immersion      in research and development activities; and  4   exposure across the wide range      of basic informational and computational sciences  Informatics training programs       that implement these features, irrespective of their funding sources, will meet      and exceed the challenges raised by the BISTI report, and optimally prepare their     trainees for careers in a field that continues to evolve

PMID- 14764616   - OBJECTIVE: There is an abundance of health-related information online, and      millions of consumers search for such information  Spell checking is of crucial      importance in returning pertinent results, so the authors propose a technique for     increasing the effectiveness of spell-checking tools used for health-related      information retrieval  DESIGN: A sample of incorrectly spelled medical terms was       submitted to two different spell-checking tools, and the resulting suggestions,      derived under two different dictionary configurations, were re-sorted according      to how frequently each term appeared in log data from a medical search engine       MEASUREMENTS: Univariable analysis was carried out to assess the effect of each      factor  spell-checking tool, dictionary type, re-sort, or no re-sort  on the      probability of success  The factors that were statistically significant in the      univariable analysis were then used in multivariable analysis to evaluate the      independent effect of each of the factors  RESULTS: The re-sorted suggestions      proved to be significantly more accurate than the original list returned by the      spell-checking tool  The odds of finding the correct suggestion in the number one      rank were increased by 63% after re-sorting using the authors' method  This      effect was independent of both the dictionary and the spell-checking tools that      were used  CONCLUSION: Using knowledge about the frequency of a given word's      occurrence in the medical domain can significantly improve spelling correction      for medical queries

PMID- 14764612   - Most studies of the impact of information systems in organizations tend to see      the implementation process as a "rollout" of technology, as a technical matter     removed from organizational dynamics  There is substantial agreement that the      success of implementing information systems is determined by organizational      factors  However, it is less clear what these factors are  The authors propose to      characterize the introduction of an information system as a process of mutual      shaping  As a result, both the technology and the practice supported by the      technology are transformed, and specific technical and social outcomes gradually       emerge  The authors suggest that insights from social studies of science and      technology can help to understand an implementation process  Focusing on three      theoretical aspects, the authors argue first that the implementation process      should be understood as a thoroughly social process in which both technology and       practice are transformed  Second, following Orlikowski's concept of "emergent      change," they suggest that implementing a system is, by its very nature,      unpredictable  Third, they argue that success and failure are not dichotomous and      static categories, but socially negotiated judgments  Using these insights, the      authors have analyzed the implementation of a computerized physician order entry        CPOE  system in a large Dutch university medical center  During the course of      this study, the full implementation of CPOE was halted, but the aborted      implementation exposed issues on which the authors did not initially focus

PMID- 14764611   - OBJECTIVE: The Unified Medical Language System's  UMLS's  Semantic Network's       SN's  two-tree structure is restrictive because it does not allow a semantic      type to be a specialization of several other semantic types  In this article, the      SN is expanded into a multiple subsumption structure with a directed acyclic      graph  DAG  IS-A hierarchy, allowing a semantic type to have multiple parents       New viable IS-A links are added as warranted  DESIGN: Two methodologies are      presented to identify and add new viable IS-A links  The first methodology is      based on imposing the characteristic of connectivity on a previously presented      partition of the SN  Four transformations are provided to find viable IS-A links       in the process of converting the partition's disconnected groups into connected      ones  The second methodology identifies new IS-A links through a string matching       process involving names and definitions of various semantic types in the SN  A      domain expert is needed to review all the results to determine the validity of      the new IS-A links  RESULTS: Nineteen new IS-A links are added to the SN, and      four new semantic types are also created to support the multiple subsumption      framework  The resulting network, called the Enriched Semantic Network  ESN ,      exhibits a DAG-structured hierarchy  A partition of the ESN containing 19      connected groups is also derived  CONCLUSION: The ESN is an expanded abstraction       of the UMLS compared with the original SN  Its multiple subsumption hierarchy can      accommodate semantic types with multiple parents  Its representation thus      provides direct access to a broader range of subsumption knowledge

PMID- 14764610   - OBJECTIVE: Since 1999, the Nursing Terminology Summits have promoted the      development, evaluation, and use of reference terminology for nursing and its      integration into comprehensive health care data standards  The use of such      standards to represent nursing knowledge, terminology, processes, and information      in electronic health records will enhance continuity of care, decision support,      and the exchange of comparable patient information  As part of this activity,      working groups at the 2001, 2002, and 2003 Summit Conferences examined how to      represent nursing information in the Health Level 7  HL7  Reference Information      Model  RIM   DESIGN: The working groups represented the nursing process as a      dynamic sequence of phases, each containing information specific to the      activities of the phase  They used Universal Modeling Language  UML  to represent      this domain knowledge in models  An Activity Diagram was used to create a dynamic      model of the nursing process  After creating a structural model of the      information used at each stage of the nursing process, the working groups mapped       that information to the HL7 RIM  They used a hierarchical structure for the      organization of nursing knowledge as the basis for a hierarchical model for     "Findings about the patient " The modeling and mapping reported here were      exploratory and preliminary, not exhaustive or definitive  The intent was to      evaluate the feasibility of representing some types of nursing information      consistently with HL7 standards  MEASUREMENTS: The working groups conducted a      small-scale validation by testing examples of nursing terminology against the HL7      RIM class "Observation " RESULTS: It was feasible to map patient information from      the proposed models to the RIM class "Observation " Examples illustrate the      models and the mapping of nursing terminology to the HL7 RIM  CONCLUSION: It is      possible to model and map nursing information into the comprehensive health care       information model, the HL7 RIM  These models must evolve and undergo further     validation by clinicians  The integration of nursing information, terminology,      and processes in information models is a first step toward rendering nursing      information machine-readable in electronic patient records and messages  An      eventual practical result, after much more development, would be to create      computable, structured information for nursing documentation

PMID- 14662803   - The effective coordination of health care relies on communication of confidential      information about consumers between different health and community care services       However, consumers must be able to give or withhold "e-Consent" to those who wish      to access their electronic health information  There are several possible forms      for e-Consent  In the general consent model, a patient provides blanket consent      for access to his or her information by an organization for all future      information requests  Conversely, general denial explicitly denies consent for     information to be used in future circumstances, and in each new episode of care,       a new consent would be needed to obtain information  In the general consent with       specific denial model, a patient attaches specific exclusion conditions to his or     her general approval to future accesses  In contrast, in the general denial with       explicit consent model, a patient issues a blanket block on all future accesses      but allows the inclusion of future use under specified conditions  There also are      several alternative functions for an e-Consent system  Consent could be captured       as a matter of legal record  E-Consent systems could be more active by prompting       clinicians to indicate that they have noted consent conditions before they access      a record  Finally, the record of patient consent could be fully active and used      as a gatekeeper in a distributed information environment  There probably will      need to be some form of data object that is associated with patient information        This e-Consent object  or e-Co  will contain the specific conditions under which       the data to which it is attached can be retrieved  Given the complexity of      clinical work and the substantial variation we can expect in an individual's      desire to make his or her personal medical details available, it is unlikely a      "one size fits all" approach to e-Consent will work  Consequently, with a      well-chosen consent design, it should be possible to balance the specific need      for privacy of some of the population against the desire by others to err on the       side of clinical safety, and clinicians desire to minimize the burden that an      electronic consent mechanism would impose

PMID- 14662801   - OBJECTIVES: To determine clinicians'  doctors', nurses', and allied health      professionals'  "actual" and "reported" use of a point-of-care online information      retrieval system; and to make an assessment of the extent to which use is related      to direct patient care by testing two hypotheses: hypothesis 1: clinicians use      online evidence primarily to support clinical decisions relating to direct      patient care; and hypothesis 2: clinicians use online evidence predominantly for       research and continuing education  DESIGN: Web-log analysis of the Clinical      Information Access Program  CIAP , an online, 24-hour, point-of-care information       retrieval system available to 55,000 clinicians in public hospitals in New South       Wales, Australia  A statewide mail survey of 5,511 clinicians  MEASUREMENTS:      Rates of online evidence searching per 100 clinicians for the state and for the      81 individual hospitals studied; reported use of CIAP by clinicians through a      self-administered questionnaire; and correlations between evidence searches and      patient admissions  RESULTS: Monthly rates of 48 5 "search sessions" per 100      clinicians and 231 6 text hits to single-source databases per 100 clinicians  n =      619,545 ; 63% of clinicians reported that they were aware of CIAP and 75% of      those had used it  Eighty-eight percent of users reported CIAP had the potential       to improve patient care and 41% reported direct experience of this  Clinicians'      use of CIAP on each day of the week was highly positively correlated with patient      admissions  r = 0 99, p < 0 001   This was also true for all ten randomly      selected hospitals  CONCLUSION: Clinicians' online evidence use increases with      patient admissions, supporting the hypothesis that clinicians' use of evidence is      related to direct patient care  Patterns of evidence use and clinicians'      self-reports also support this hypothesis

PMID- 14662800   - Clinicians generally record medical narrative data, such as current complaints,      physical examination, and progress notes, as free text in paper-based medical      records  The medical narrative involves heterogeneous and detailed data that      include the description of  multiple  occurrences of medical findings or symptoms      that may progress over time  Structured, electronic recording of narrative data      would facilitate the use of these data for research  The authors' OpenSDE      application supports clinicians with the structured recording of narrative data      in both research and care settings  Data entry is enabled using forms that are      generated using domain-specific trees of medical concepts  For data storage, the       authors have expanded the traditional row modeling methodology with additional      columns that allow structured representation of medical narratives including      descriptions of findings, multiple occurrences of findings, and the progression      of findings over time

PMID- 14633936   - Medical error reduction is an international issue, as is the implementation of      patient care information systems  PCISs  as a potential means to achieving it  As      researchers conducting separate studies in the United States, The Netherlands,      and Australia, using similar qualitative methods to investigate implementing      PCISs, the authors have encountered many instances in which PCIS applications      seem to foster errors rather than reduce their likelihood  The authors describe      the kinds of silent errors they have witnessed and, from their different social      science perspectives  information science, sociology, and cognitive science ,      they interpret the nature of these errors  The errors fall into two main      categories: those in the process of entering and retrieving information, and      those in the communication and coordination process that the PCIS is supposed to       support  The authors believe that with a heightened awareness of these issues,      informaticians can educate, design systems, implement, and conduct research in      such a way that they might be able to avoid the unintended consequences of these       subtle silent errors

PMID- 14633935   - OBJECTIVE: To determine the availability of inpatient computerized physician      order entry in U S  hospitals and the degree to which physicians are using it       DESIGN: Combined mail and telephone survey of 964 randomly selected hospitals,      contrasting 2002 data and results of a survey conducted in 1997  MEASUREMENTS:      Availability: computerized order entry has been installed and is available for     use by physicians; inducement: the degree to which use of computers to enter     orders is required of physicians; participation: the proportion of physicians at       an institution who enter orders by computer; and saturation: the proportion of      total orders at an institution entered by a physician using a computer  RESULTS:       The response rate was 65%  Computerized order entry was not available to      physicians at 524  83 7%  of 626 hospitals responding, whereas 60  9 6%  reported      complete availability and 41  6 5%  reported partial availability  Of 91      hospitals providing data about inducement/requirement to use the system, it was      optional at 31  34 1% , encouraged at 18  19 8% , and required at 42  46 2%   At       36 hospitals  45 6% , more than 90% of physicians on staff use the system,      whereas six  7 6%  reported 51-90% participation and 37  46 8%  reported      participation by fewer than half of physicians  Saturation was bimodal, with 25       35%  hospitals reporting that more than 90% of all orders are entered by      physicians using a computer and 20  28 2%  reporting that less than 10% of all      orders are entered this way  CONCLUSION: Despite increasing consensus about the      desirability of computerized physician order entry  CPOE  use, these data      indicate that only 9 6% of U S  hospitals presently have CPOE completely      available  In those hospitals that have CPOE, its use is frequently required  In       approximately half of those hospitals, more than 90% of physicians use CPOE; in      one-third of them, more than 90% of orders are entered via CPOE

PMID- 14633934   - Computerized physician order entry  CPOE  is touted as a major improvement in      patient safety, primarily as a result of the Institute of Medicine's 1999 report       on medical errors and the subsequent formation of the "Leapfrog Group" of      companies to preferentially direct their employees' health care to those      institutions that install such systems  as part of directives that "Leapfrog"      feels will improve patient care   Although the literature suggests that such      systems have the potential to improve patient outcomes through decrease of      adverse drug events, actual improvements in medical outcomes have not been      documented  Installation of such systems could actually increase the number of      adverse drug events and result in higher overall medical costs, particularly in      the first few years of their adoption

PMID- 14633933   - Syndromic surveillance refers to methods relying on detection of individual and      population health indicators that are discernible before confirmed diagnoses are       made  In particular, prior to the laboratory confirmation of an infectious      disease, ill persons may exhibit behavioral patterns, symptoms, signs, or     laboratory findings that can be tracked through a variety of data sources       Syndromic surveillance systems are being developed locally, regionally, and      nationally  The efforts have been largely directed at facilitating the early      detection of a covert bioterrorist attack, but the technology may also be useful       for general public health, clinical medicine, quality improvement, patient      safety, and research  This report, authored by developers and methodologists      involved in the design and deployment of the first wave of syndromic surveillance      systems, is intended to serve as a guide for informaticians, public health      managers, and practitioners who are currently planning deployment of such systems      in their regions

PMID- 14633932   - There are constraints embedded in medical record structure that limit use by      patients in self-directed disease management  Through systematic review of the      literature from a critical perspective, four characteristics that either enhance       or mitigate the influence of medical record structure on patient utilization of      an electronic patient record  EPR  system have been identified: environmental      pressures, physician centeredness, collaborative organizational culture, and      patient centeredness  An evaluation framework is proposed for use when      considering adaptation of existing EPR systems for online patient access       Exemplars of patient-accessible EPR systems from the literature are evaluated      utilizing the framework  From this study, it appears that traditional information      system research and development methods may not wholly capture many pertinent      social issues that arise when expanding access of EPR systems to patients       Critically rooted methods such as action research can directly inform development      strategies so that these systems may positively influence health outcomes

PMID- 14527978   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rigorously evaluate perceived differences      in satisfaction with an electronic health record  EHR  between residents of two      medical specialties who share the same health record, practice location,      administration, and information technology support  DESIGN: A cross-sectional      survey was used comparing user satisfaction between pediatrics residents and      internal medicine residents in an academic practice  MEASUREMENTS: The survey was      designed to measure baseline demographic characteristics, attitudes toward      computers, general satisfaction with an EHR, and perceived practicality of use,      variation from familiar practice, organizational support, and impact on delivery       of care  RESULTS: Medicine subjects were similar to pediatrics subjects in      baseline demographic characteristics  Satisfaction with the EHR implementation      was very high for both sets of subjects, but internal medicine residents were      significantly less likely to be satisfied with the EHR implementation  relative      risk [RR]=0 84, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0 73-0 98  and considerably less      likely to believe that their colleagues were satisfied with it  RR=0 56, 95%      CI=0 41-0 77   The only surveyed characteristic independently predicting      satisfaction was medical specialty  p=0 04   Medicine subjects were less likely      to believe template-based documentation improved their efficiency  RR=0 64, 95%      CI=0 46-0 88   They were significantly more likely to believe the system had been      designed to improve billing  RR=1 50, 95% CI=1 05-2 04  and not to improve      patient care  RR=0 61, 95% CI=0 44-0 85   CONCLUSION: The authors found a      difference in satisfaction between internal medicine and pediatrics users of an      EHR  Although many potential factors that influence satisfaction were similar     between subjects in the two specialties, differences in previous experience may      have influenced the results  Medicine residents had more previous experience with      a different EHR implementation, which they may have perceived as superior to the       one involved in this study  Pediatric residents had more previous experience with      structured data entry prior to EHR implementation and more preventive care      patient encounters for which structured data entry may be well suited  Since      successful implementations generally require satisfied users, understanding what       factors affect satisfaction can improve chances of a system's success

PMID- 14527975   - OBJECTIVE: Electronic prescribing  e-prescribing  may substantially improve      health care quality and efficiency, but the available systems are complex and      their heterogeneity makes comparing and evaluating them a challenge  The authors       aimed to develop a conceptual framework for anticipating the effects of      alternative designs for outpatient e-prescribing systems  DESIGN: Based on a      literature review and on telephone interviews with e-prescribing vendors, the      authors identified distinct e-prescribing functional capabilities and developed a      conceptual framework for evaluating e-prescribing systems' potential effects      based on their capabilities  Analyses of two commercial e-prescribing systems are      presented as examples of applying the conceptual framework  MEASUREMENTS: Major     e-prescribing functional capabilities identified and the availability of evidence      to support their specific effects  RESULTS: The proposed framework for evaluating      e-prescribing systems is organized using a process model of medication      management  Fourteen e-prescribing functional capabilities are identified within       the model  Evidence is identified to support eight specific effects for six of      the functional capabilities  The evidence also shows that a functional capability      with generally positive effects can be implemented in a way that creates      unintended hazards  Applying the framework involves identifying an e-prescribing       system's functional capabilities within the process model and then assessing the       effects that could be expected from each capability in the proposed clinical      environment  CONCLUSION: The proposed conceptual framework supports the      integration of available evidence in considering the full range of effects from      e-prescribing design alternatives  More research is needed into the effects of      specific e-prescribing functional alternatives  Until more is known,      e-prescribing initiatives should include provisions to monitor for unintended      hazards

PMID- 14527973   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a program of      repeated assessments, feedback, and training on the quality of coded clinical      data in general practice  DESIGN: A prospective uncontrolled intervention study      was conducted in a general practice research network  MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of      recorded consultations with a coded problem title and percentage of patients      receiving a specific drug  e g , tamoxifen  who had the relevant morbidity code       e g , breast cancer  were calculated  Annual period prevalence of 12 selected      morbidities was compared with parallel data derived from the fourth National      Study of Morbidity Statistics from General Practice  MSGP4   RESULTS: The first      two measures showed variation between practices at baseline, but on repeat      assessments all practices improved or maintained their levels of coding  The      period prevalence figures also were variable, but over time rates increased to      levels comparable with, or above, MSGP4 rates  Practices were able to provide      time and resources for feedback and training sessions  CONCLUSION: A program of      repeated assessments, feedback, and training appears to improve data quality in a      range of practices  The program is likely to be generalizable to other practices       but needs a trained support team to implement it that has implications for cost      and resources

PMID- 14527971   - Use of digital medical images has become common over the last several years,      coincident with the release of inexpensive, mega-pixel quality digital cameras      and the transition to digital radiology operation by hospitals  One problem that       clinicians, medical educators, and basic scientists encounter when handling      images is the difficulty of using business and graphic arts      commercial-off-the-shelf  COTS  software in multicontext authoring and      interactive teaching environments  The authors investigated and developed      software-supported methodologies to help clinicians, medical educators, and basic      scientists become more efficient and effective in their digital imaging      environments  The software that the authors developed provides the ability to      annotate images based on a multispecialty methodology for annotation and visual      knowledge representation  This annotation methodology is designed by consensus,      with contributions from the authors and physicians, medical educators, and basic       scientists in the Departments of Radiology, Neurobiology and Anatomy,      Dermatology, and Ophthalmology at the University of Utah  The annotation      methodology functions as a foundation for creating, using, reusing, and extending      dynamic annotations in a context-appropriate, interactive digital environment       The annotation methodology supports the authoring process as well as output and      presentation mechanisms  The annotation methodology is the foundation for a      Windows implementation that allows annotated elements to be represented as      structured eXtensible Markup Language and stored separate from the image s

PMID- 14527970   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical impact of      computerized decision support with and without electronic access to clinical      guidelines and laboratory data on antibiotic prescribing decisions  DESIGN: A      crossover trial was conducted of four levels of computerized decision support-no       support, antibiotic guidelines, laboratory reports, and laboratory reports plus a      decision support system  DSS , randomly allocated to eight simulated clinical      cases accessed by the Web  MEASUREMENTS: Rate of intervention adoption was      measured by frequency of accessing information support, cost of use was measured       by time taken to complete each case, and effectiveness of decision was measured      by correctness of and self-reported confidence in individual prescribing      decisions  Clinical impact score was measured by adoption rate and decision      effectiveness  RESULTS: Thirty-one intensive care and infectious disease      specialist physicians  ICPs and IDPs  participated in the study       Ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment guidelines were used in 24  39%  of the      62 case scenarios for which they were available, microbiology reports in 36       58% , and the DSS in 37  60%   The use of all forms of information support did      not affect clinicians' confidence in their decisions  Their use of the DSS plus      microbiology report improved the agreement of decisions with those of an expert      panel from 65% to 97%  p=0 0002 , or to 67%  p=0 002  when antibiotic guidelines       only were accessed  Significantly fewer IDPs than ICPs accessed information      support in making treatment decisions  On average, it took 245 seconds to make a       decision using the DSS compared with 113 seconds for unaided prescribing       p<0 001   The DSS plus microbiology reports had the highest clinical impact      score  0 58 , greater than that of electronic guidelines  0 26  and electronic      laboratory reports  0 45   CONCLUSION: When used, computer-based decision support      significantly improved decision quality  In measuring the impact of decision      support systems, both their effectiveness in improving decisions and their likely      rate of adoption in the clinical environment need to be considered  Clinicians      chose to use antibiotic guidelines for one third and microbiology reports or the       DSS for about two thirds of cases when they were available to assist their     prescribing decisions

PMID- 12925553   - OBJECTIVE: Qualitative studies can help us understand the "successes" and      "failures" of telemedicine to normalize within clinical service provision  This      report presents the development of a robust conceptual model of normalization      processes in the implementation and development of telemedicine services  DESIGN:      Retrospective and cumulative analysis of longitudinal qualitative data from three      studies was undertaken between 1997 and 2002  Observation and semistructured      interviews produced a substantial body of data relating to approximately 582      discrete data collection episodes  Data were analyzed separately in each of three      studies  Cumulative analysis was conducted by constant comparison  RESULTS:  1       Implementation of telemedicine services depends on a positive link with a  local       or national  policy level sponsor   2  Adoption of telemedicine systems in      service depends on successful structural integration so that development of      organizational structures takes place   3  Translation of telemedicine      technologies into clinical practice depends on the enrollment of cohesive,      cooperative groups   4  Stabilization of telemedicine systems in practice depends      on integration at the level of professional knowledge and practice, where      clinicians are able to accommodate telemedicine through the development of new      procedures and protocols  CONCLUSION: A rationalized linear diffusion model of      "telehealthcare" is inadequate in assessing the potential for normalization, and       the political, organizational, and "ownership" problems that govern the process      of development, implementation, and normalization need to be accounted for  This       report presents a model for assessing the potential for successful implementation      of telehealthcare services  This model defines the requirements for the      successful normalization of telemedicine systems in clinical practice

PMID- 12925552   - In this report, the authors compare and contrast medical informatics  MI  and      bioinformatics  BI  and provide a viewpoint on their complementarities and      potential for collaboration in various subfields  The authors compare MI and BI      along several dimensions, including:  1  historical development of the      disciplines,  2  their scientific foundations,  3  data quality and analysis,  4       integration of knowledge and databases,  5  informatics tools to support      practice,  6  informatics methods to support research  signal processing, imaging      and vision, and computational modeling,  7  professional and patient continuing      education, and  8  education and training  It is pointed out that, while the two       disciplines differ in their histories, scientific foundations, and methodologic      approaches to research in various areas, they nevertheless share methods and      tools, which provides a basis for exchange of experience in their different      applications  MI expertise in developing health care applications and the      strength of BI in biological "discovery science" complement each other well  The       new field of biomedical informatics  BMI  holds great promise for developing      informatics methods that will be crucial in the development of genomic medicine        The future of BMI will be influenced strongly by whether significant advances in       clinical practice and biomedical research come about from separate efforts in MI       and BI, or from emerging, hybrid informatics subdisciplines at their interface

PMID- 12925550   - OBJECTIVE: It is not automatically given that the paper-based medical record can       be eliminated after the introduction of an electronic medical record  EMR  in a      hospital  Many keep and update the paper-based counterpart, and this limits the      use of the EMR system  The authors have evaluated the physicians' clinical work      practices and attitudes toward a system in a hospital that has eliminated the      paper-based counterpart using scanning technology  DESIGN: Combined open-ended      interviews  8 physicians  and cross-sectional survey  70 physicians  were      conducted and compared with reference data from a previous national survey  69      physicians from six hospitals   The hospitals in the reference group were using      the same EMR system without the scanning module  MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire        English translation available as an online data supplement at <www jamia org>       covered frequency of use of the EMR system for 19 defined tasks, ease of      performing them, and user satisfaction  The interviews were open-ended  RESULTS:       The physicians routinely used the system for nine of 11 tasks regarding retrieval      of patient data, which the majority of the physicians found more easily performed      than before  However, 22% to 25% of the physicians found retrieval of patient      data more difficult, particularly among internists  33%   Overall, the physicians      were equally satisfied with the part of the system handling the regular     electronic data as that of the physicians in the reference group  They were,      however, much less satisfied with the use of scanned document images than that of      regular electronic data, using the former less frequently than the latter       CONCLUSION: Scanning and elimination of the paper-based medical record is      feasible, but the scanned document images should be considered an intermediate      stage toward fully electronic medical records  To our knowledge, this is the      first assessment from a hospital in the process of completing such a scanning      project

PMID- 12925549   - OBJECTIVE: Few previous studies evaluating the benefits of diagnostic decision      support systems have simultaneously measured changes in diagnostic quality and      clinical management prompted by use of the system  This report describes a      reliable and valid scoring technique to measure the quality of clinical decision       plans in an acute medical setting, where diagnostic decision support tools might       prove most useful  DESIGN: Sets of differential diagnoses and clinical management      plans generated by 71 clinicians for six simulated cases, before and after     decision support from a Web-based pediatric differential diagnostic tool       ISABEL , were used  MEASUREMENTS: A composite quality score was calculated      separately for each diagnostic and management plan by considering the      appropriateness value of each component diagnostic or management suggestion, a      weighted sum of individual suggestion ratings, relevance of the entire plan, and       its comprehensiveness  The reliability and validity  face, concurrent, construct,      and content  of these two final scores were examined  RESULTS: Two hundred      fifty-two diagnostic and 350 management suggestions were included in the      interrater reliability analysis  There was good agreement between raters       intraclass correlation coefficient, 0 79 for diagnoses, and 0 72 for     management   No counterintuitive scores were demonstrated on visual inspection of      the sets  Content validity was verified by a consultation process with      pediatricians  Both scores discriminated adequately between the plans of      consultants and medical students and correlated well with clinicians' subjective       opinions of overall plan quality  Spearman rho 0 65, p < 0 01   The diagnostic      and management scores for each episode showed moderate correlation  r = 0 51        CONCLUSION: The scores described can be used as key outcome measures in a larger       study to fully assess the value of diagnostic decision aids, such as the ISABEL      system

PMID- 12925548   - Medical error reporting systems are important information sources for designing      strategies to improve the safety of health care  Applied Strategies for Improving      Patient Safety  ASIPS  is a multi-institutional, practice-based research project       that collects and analyzes data on primary care medical errors and develops      interventions to reduce error  The voluntary ASIPS Patient Safety Reporting      System captures anonymous and confidential reports of medical errors       Confidential reports, which are quickly de-identified, provide better detail than      do anonymous reports; however, concerns exist about the confidentiality of those       reports should the database be subject to legal discovery or other security      breaches  Standard database elements, for example, serial ID numbers, date/time      stamps, and backups, could enable an outsider to link an ASIPS report to a      specific medical error  The authors present the design and implementation of a      database and administrative system that reduce this risk, facilitate research,      and maintain near anonymity of the events, practices, and clinicians

PMID- 12925546   - More than 20% of approximately 35,000 patients filling a diuretic prescription      had no potassium blood test recorded within the previous year  A laboratory      reporting system used throughout Israel by Maccabi Healthcare Services physicians      was modified to provide physician alerts regarding potassium testing  The      physicians were experienced users of a computerized medical record  CMR  that      provided online laboratory test results  A nightly batch file checked pharmacy      diuretic purchases against the patient's potassium blood test status  On-screen      computer-generated reminders were sent to physicians of patients lacking a recent      potassium test  Reminders to clinicians increased potassium testing by 9 8%  p <       0 001   Physician age and gender played a small part in predicting compliance to       the alert, but specialty and practice size did not  The time delay between the      date a reminder was sent and the potassium test date decreased steadily during      the intervention  The success of this reminder system encourages expansion to      include more drug-laboratory interactions  Furthermore, direct alerts to patients      at multiple organization/patient contact points are planned

PMID- 12925545   - OBJECTIVE:  1  To evaluate preliminary effects of a computerized support system      on congruence between patients' reported symptoms and preferences and those      addressed in the patient consultation and  2  to investigate the system's ease of      use, time requirements, and patient satisfaction  DESIGN: Fifty-two patients were      randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions  MEASUREMENTS: Cancer     patients scheduled for an outpatient visit used the system on a tablet computer     to report their symptoms and preferences prior to their consultation  This      information was processed, printed, and provided to the patient and clinician in       the subsequent consultation in the experimental group but not in the control      group  RESULTS: While patients in both groups were equivalent at baseline in      symptom characteristics, there was significantly greater congruence between      patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians in the      experimental group  The system scored high on ease of use  There were no      significant group differences in patient satisfaction  CONCLUSION: This study      provided beginning evidence that eliciting patients' symptoms and preferences and      providing clinicians with this information prior to consultation can be an      effective and feasible strategy to improve patient-centered care

PMID- 12925544   - OBJECTIVE: Despite the advantages of structured data entry, much of the patient      record is still stored as unstructured or semistructured narrative text  The      issue of representing clinical document content remains problematic  The authors'      prior work using an automated UMLS document indexing system has been encouraging       but has been affected by the generally low indexing precision of such systems  In      an effort to improve precision, the authors have developed a context-sensitive      document indexing model to calculate the optimal subset of UMLS source      vocabularies used to index each document section  This pilot study was performed       to evaluate the utility of this indexing approach on a set of clinical radiology       reports  DESIGN: A set of clinical radiology reports that had been indexed      manually using UMLS concept descriptors was indexed automatically by the SAPHIRE       indexing engine  Using the data generated by this process the authors developed a      system that simulated indexing, at the document section level, of the same      document set using many permutations of a subset of the UMLS constituent      vocabularies  MEASUREMENTS: The precision and recall scores generated by      simulated indexing for each permutation of two or three UMLS constituent      vocabularies were determined  RESULTS: While there was considerable variation in       precision and recall values across the different subtypes of radiology reports,      the overall effect of this indexing strategy using the best combination of two or     three UMLS constituent vocabularies was an improvement in precision without      significant impact of recall  CONCLUSION: In this pilot study a contextual      indexing strategy improved overall precision in a set of clinical radiology      reports

PMID- 12925543   - While evidence-based medicine has increasingly broad-based support in health      care, it remains difficult to get physicians to actually practice it  Across most      domains in medicine, practice has lagged behind knowledge by at least several      years  The authors believe that the key tools for closing this gap will be      information systems that provide decision support to users at the time they make       decisions, which should result in improved quality of care  Furthermore,      providers make many errors, and clinical decision support can be useful for     finding and preventing such errors  Over the last eight years the authors have      implemented and studied the impact of decision support across a broad array of      domains and have found a number of common elements important to success  The goal      of this report is to discuss these lessons learned in the interest of informing      the efforts of others working to make the practice of evidence-based medicine a      reality

PMID- 12925542   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sales of electrolyte products contain a signal of      outbreaks of respiratory and diarrheal disease in children and, if so, how much      earlier a signal relative to hospital diagnoses  DESIGN: Retrospective analysis      was conducted of sales of electrolyte products and hospital diagnoses for six      urban regions in three states for the period 1998 through 2001  MEASUREMENTS:      Presence of signal was ascertained by measuring correlation between electrolyte      sales and hospital diagnoses and the temporal relationship that maximized      correlation  Earliness was the difference between the date that the exponentially      weighted moving average  EWMA  method first detected an outbreak from sales and      the date it first detected the outbreak from diagnoses  The coefficient of      determination  r2  measured how much variance in earliness resulted from      differences in sales' and diagnoses' signal strengths  RESULTS: The correlation      between electrolyte sales and hospital diagnoses was 0 90  95% CI, 0 87-0 93  at       a time offset of 1 7 weeks  95% CI, 0 50-2 9 , meaning that sales preceded      diagnoses by 1 7 weeks  EWMA with a nine-sigma threshold detected the 18      outbreaks on average 2 4 weeks  95% CI, 0 1-4 8 weeks  earlier from sales than      from diagnoses  Twelve outbreaks were first detected from sales, four were first       detected from diagnoses, and two were detected simultaneously  Only 26% of      variance in earliness was explained by the relative strength of the sales and      diagnoses signals  r2 = 0 26   CONCLUSION: Sales of electrolyte products contain       a signal of outbreaks of respiratory and diarrheal diseases in children and      usually are an earlier signal than hospital diagnoses

PMID- 12807814   - Peer-reviewed publication of scientific research results represents the most      important means of their communication  The authors have annually reviewed a      large heterogeneous set of papers to produce the International Medical      Informatics Association  IMIA  Yearbook of Medical Informatics  To support an      objective and high-quality review process, the authors attempted to provide      reviewers with a set of refined quality criteria, comprised of 80 general      criteria and an additional 60 criteria for specific types of manuscripts  Authors      conducted a randomized controlled trial, with 18 reviewers, to evaluate      application of the refined criteria on review outcomes  Whereas the trial found      that reviewers applying the criteria graded papers more strictly  lower overall      scores , and that junior reviewers appreciated the availability of the criteria,       there was no overall change in the interrater variability in reviewing the      manuscripts  The authors describe their experience as a "case report" and provide      a reference to the refined quality review criteria without claiming that the      criteria represent a validated instrument for quantitative quality measurement

PMID- 12807813   - With the introduction of ICD-10 as the standard for diagnostics, it becomes      necessary to develop an electronic representation of its complete content,      inherent semantics, and coding rules  The authors' design relates to the current       efforts by the CEN/TC 251 to establish a European standard for hierarchical      classification systems in health care  The authors have developed an electronic      representation of ICD-10 with the eXtensible Markup Language  XML  that      facilitates integration into current information systems and coding software,      taking different languages and versions into account  In this context, XML      provides a complete processing framework of related technologies and standard      tools that helps develop interoperable applications  XML provides semantic      markup  It allows domain-specific definition of tags and hierarchical document      structure  The idea of linking and thus combining information from different      sources is a valuable feature of XML  In addition, XML topic maps are used to      describe relationships between different sources, or "semantically associated"      parts of these sources  The issue of achieving a standardized medical vocabulary       becomes more and more important with the stepwise implementation of      diagnostically related groups, for example  The aim of the authors' work is to      provide a transparent and open infrastructure that can be used to support      clinical coding and to develop further software applications  The authors are      assuming that a comprehensive representation of the content, structure, inherent       semantics, and layout of medical classification systems can be achieved through a      document-oriented approach

PMID- 12807810   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect that the computer     interpretation  CI  of electrocardiograms  EKGs  has on the accuracy of resident        noncardiologist  physicians reading EKGs  DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial      was conducted in a laboratory setting from February through June 2001, using a      two-period crossover design with matched pairs of subjects randomly assigned to      sequencing groups  MEASUREMENTS: Subjects' interpretive accuracy of discrete,      cardiologist-determined EKG findings were measured as judged by a board-certified      internist  RESULTS: Without the CI, subjects interpreted 48 9%  95% confidence      interval, 45 0% to 52 8%  of the findings correctly  With the CI, subjects      interpreted 55 4%  51 9% to 58 9%  correctly  p < 0 0001   When the CIs that      agreed with the gold standard  Correct CIs  were not included, 53 1%  47 7% to      58 5%  of the findings were interpreted correctly  When the correct CI was      included, accuracy increased to 68 1%  63 2% to 72 7%; p < 0 0001   When computer     advice that did not agree with the gold standard  Incorrect CI  was not provided       to the subjects, 56 7%  48 5% to 64 5%  of findings were interpreted correctly       Accuracy dropped to 48 3%  40 4% to 56 4%  when the incorrect computer advice was      provided  p = 0 131   Subjects erroneously agreed with the incorrect CI more      often when it was presented with the EKG 67 7%  57 2% to 76 7%  than when it was       not 34 6%  23 8% to 47 3%; p < 0 0001   CONCLUSIONS: Computer decision support      systems can generally improve the interpretive accuracy of internal medicine      residents in reading EKGs  However, subjects were influenced significantly by      incorrect advice, which tempers the overall usefulness of computer-generated      advice in this and perhaps other areas

PMID- 12807809   - The iterative development of the Falls Risk Assessment and Management System       FRAMS  drew upon research evidence and early consumer and clinician input      through focus groups, interviews, direct observations, and an online      questionnaire  Clinical vignettes were used to validate the clinical model and      program logic, input, and output  The information model was developed within the       Australian General Practice Data Model  GPDM  framework  The online FRAMS      implementation used available Internet  TCP/IP , messaging  HL7, XML , knowledge       representation  Arden Syntax , and classification  ICD10-AM, ICPC2  standards       Although it could accommodate most of the falls prevention information elements,       the GPDM required extension for prevention and prescribing risk management       Existing classifications could not classify all falls prevention concepts  The      lack of explicit rules for terminology and data definitions allowed multiple      concept representations across the terminology-architecture interface  Patients      were more enthusiastic than clinicians  A usable standards-based      online-distributed decision support system for falls prevention can be      implemented within the GPDM, but a comprehensive terminology is required  The      conceptual interface between terminology and architecture requires      standardization, preferably within a reference information model  Developments in      electronic decision support must be guided by evidence-based clinical and      information models and knowledge ontologies  The safety and quality of      knowledge-based decision support systems must be monitored  Further examination      of falls and other clinical domains within the GPDM is needed

PMID- 12807808   - Paper-based and electronic patient records generally are used in parallel to      support different tasks  Many studies comparing their quality do not report      sufficiently on the methods used  Few studies refer to the patient  Instead, most      regard the paper record as the gold standard  Focusing on quality criteria, the      current study compared the two records patient by patient, presuming that each      might hold unique advantages  For surgical patients at a nonuniversity hospital,       diagnosis and procedure codes from the hospital's electronic patient record  EPR       set  were compared with the paper records  PPR set   Diagnosis coding from the      paper-based patient record resulted in minor qualitative advantages  The EPR     documentation showed potential advantages in both quality and quantity of      procedure coding  As in many previous studies, the current study relied on a      single individual to extract and transform contents from the paper record to      compare PPR with EPR  The exploratory study, although limited, supports previous       views of the complementary nature of paper and electronic records  The lessons      learned from this study are that medical professionals should be cognizant of the      possible discrepancies between paper and electronic information and look toward      combining information from both records whenever appropriate  The inadequate      methodology  transformations done by a single individual  used in the authors'      study is typical of other studies in the field  The limited generalizability and       restricted reproducibility of this commonly used approach emphasize the need to      improve methods for comparing paper-based with electronic versions of a patient's      chart

PMID- 12807804   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether physician offices      located in high-minority and low-income neighborhoods have different levels of      access to information technology than offices located in lower-minority and      higher-income areas  DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of      pediatrics, family medicine, and general practice offices in Orange County,      California  Survey data were linked with community demographic data from the 2000      Census using a geographical information system  RESULTS: Of 307 offices surveyed,      141 responded  46%   Offices located in high-minority and high-poverty areas were      as likely to respond as other offices  Among responding offices, 94% had a      computer, 77% had Web access, 29% had broadband Internet access, and 53% used      computerized scheduling and billing systems  Offices located in minority and      low-income communities had equivalent access to each technology  Offices in      communities with larger proportions of Hispanics were less likely to have      practice Web pages, but other uses of the Internet were not associated with      practice location  Offices reported high levels of interest in online clinical      systems but also high levels of concern about these systems' usability and      confidentiality  Offices with Web access and those with practice management      systems expressed greater interest in online clinical systems but also greater     levels of concern about usability and confidentiality  These attitudes were      equivalent among offices in different communities  CONCLUSION: Primary care      offices located in poor and minority communities in a large, suburban county had       high levels of access to and interest in Web-based systems  Physicians' offices      may therefore provide a venue for online services aimed at improving health      outcomes for poor and minority communities  Research is needed in other     geographic regions to determine the generalizability of these findings

PMID- 12668694   - Physician order entry is a powerful function of a computerized hospital      information system  Although designed to be clinician-driven, the imaging section      of the order entry system may not be designed optimally to engage the clinician      with imaging procedures logically organized for the clinician's typical work      patterns  There also may be resistance among overburdened clinicians in having to      take the time to learn a new computer system and to assume "clerk's duties" of      entering imaging orders  A potential means to address clinician opposition is to       cooperatively engage each clinical service in the design of an imaging order     entry system with customized menus for each service  This article reports a      step-by-step process for the implementation of an imaging order entry system with      specialized menus for an orthopedic service  This implementation process includes       1  identification of key personnel,  2  familiarization with the system,  3       discussion and dialogue between key personnel,  4  addressing specific problems,        5  education and orientation of the target group,  6  initial implementation,       7  feedback and improvement,  8  demonstration project  time study  to foster     acceptance, and  9  ongoing enhancement

PMID- 12668693   - OBJECTIVE: Data representations on today's medical monitors need to be improved      to advance clinical awareness and prevent data vigilance errors  Simply building       graphical displays does not ensure an improvement in clinical performance because      displays have to be consistent with the user's clinical processes and mental      models  In this report, the development of an original pulmonary graphical      display for anesthesia is used as an example to show an iterative design process       with built-in usability testing  DESIGN: The process reported here is rapid,      inexpensive, and requires a minimal number of subjects per development cycle       Three paper-based tests evaluated the anatomic, variable mapping, and graphical      diagnostic meaning of the pulmonary display  MEASUREMENTS: A confusion matrix      compared the designer's intended answer with the subject's chosen answer       Considering deviations off the diagonal of the confusion matrix as design      weaknesses, the pulmonary display was modified and retested  The iterative cycle       continued until the anatomic and variable mapping cumulative test scores for a      chosen design scored above 90% and the graphical diagnostic meaning test scored      above 75%  RESULTS: The iterative development test resulted in five design      iterations  The final graphical pulmonary display improved the overall      intuitiveness by 18%  The display was tested in three categories: anatomic      features, variable mapping, and diagnostic accuracy  The anatomic intuitiveness      increased by 25%, variable mapping intuitiveness increased by 34%, and diagnostic      accuracy decreased slightly by 4%  CONCLUSION: With this rapid iterative      development process, an intuitive graphical display can be developed      inexpensively prior to formal testing in an experimental setting

PMID- 12668692   - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of the study were  1  to evaluate the usefulness of the      International Standards Organization  ISO  Reference Terminology Model for     Nursing Diagnoses as a terminology model for defining nursing diagnostic concepts      in the Medical Entities Dictionary  MED  and  2  to create the additional      hierarchical structures required for integration of nursing diagnostic concepts      into the MED  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: The authors dissected nursing diagnostic      terms from two source terminologies  Home Health Care Classification and the      Omaha System  into the semantic categories of the ISO model  Consistent with the       ISO model, they selected Focus and Judgment as required semantic categories for     creating intensional definitions of nursing diagnostic concepts in the MED       Because the MED does not include Focus and Judgment hierarchies, the authors      developed them to define the nursing diagnostic concepts  RESULTS: The ISO model       was sufficient for dissecting the source terminologies into atomic terms  The      authors identified 162 unique focus concepts from the 266 nursing diagnosis terms      for inclusion in the Focus hierarchy  For the Judgment hierarchy, the authors      precoordinated Judgment and Potentiality instead of using Potentiality as a      qualifier of Judgment as in the ISO model  Impairment and Alteration were the      most frequently occurring judgments  CONCLUSIONS: Nursing care represents a large      proportion of health care activities; thus, it is vital that terms used by nurses      are integrated into concept-oriented terminologies that provide broad coverage      for the domain of health care  This study supports the utility of the ISO      Reference Terminology Model for Nursing Diagnoses as a facilitator for the      integration process

PMID- 12668691   - OBJECTIVE: Detecting adverse events is pivotal for measuring and improving      medical safety, yet current techniques discourage routine screening  The authors       hypothesized that discharge summaries would include information on adverse      events, and they developed and evaluated an electronic method for screening      medical discharge summaries for adverse events  DESIGN: A cohort study including       424 randomly selected admissions to the medical services of an academic medical      center was conducted between January and July 2000  The authors developed a      computerized screening tool that searched free-text discharge summaries for     trigger words representing possible adverse events  MEASUREMENTS: All discharge      summaries with a trigger word present underwent chart review by two independent      physician reviewers  The presence of adverse events was assessed using structured      implicit judgment  A random sample of discharge summaries without trigger words      also was reviewed  RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent  251 of 424  of the discharge      summaries contained trigger words  Based on discharge summary review, 44 8%  327       of 730  of the alerted trigger words indicated a possible adverse event  After     medical record review, the tool detected 131 adverse events  The sensitivity and       specificity of the screening tool were 69% and 48%, respectively  The positive      predictive value of the tool was 52%  CONCLUSION: Medical discharge summaries      contain information regarding adverse events  Electronic screening of discharge      summaries for adverse events using keyword searches is feasible but thus far has       poor specificity  Nonetheless, computerized clinical narrative screening methods       could potentially offer researchers and quality managers a means to routinely      detect adverse events

PMID- 12668688   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and evaluation of computational tools to      identify concepts within medical curricular documents, using information derived       from the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System  UMLS        The long-term goal of the KnowledgeMap  KM  project is to provide faculty and      students with an improved ability to develop, review, and integrate components of      the medical school curriculum  DESIGN: The KM concept identifier uses lexical      resources partially derived from the UMLS  SPECIALIST lexicon and Metathesaurus ,      heuristic language processing techniques, and an empirical scoring algorithm  KM       differentiates among potentially matching Metathesaurus concepts within a source       document  The authors manually identified important "gold standard" biomedical      concepts within selected medical school full-content lecture documents and used      these documents to compare KM concept recognition with that of a known      state-of-the-art "standard"-the National Library of Medicine's MetaMap program       MEASUREMENTS: The number of "gold standard" concepts in each lecture document      identified by either KM or MetaMap, and the cause of each failure or relative      success in a random subset of documents  RESULTS: For 4,281 "gold standard"      concepts, MetaMap matched 78% and KM 82%  Precision for "gold standard" concepts       was 85% for MetaMap and 89% for KM  The heuristics of KM accurately matched      acronyms, concepts underspecified in the document, and ambiguous matches  The      most frequent cause of matching failures was absence of target concepts from the       UMLS Metathesaurus  CONCLUSION: The prototypic KM system provided an encouraging       rate of concept extraction for representative medical curricular texts  Future      versions of KM should be evaluated for their ability to allow administrators,      lecturers, and students to navigate through the medical curriculum to locate      redundancies, find interrelated information, and identify omissions  In addition,      the ability of KM to meet specific, personal information needs should be      assessed

PMID- 12668687   - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of expert knowledge on the inductive learning      process in creating classifiers for medical text reports  DESIGN: The authors      converted medical text reports to a structured form through natural language      processing  They then inductively created classifiers for medical text reports      using varying degrees and types of expert knowledge and different inductive      learning algorithms  The authors measured performance of the different      classifiers as well as the costs to induce classifiers and acquire expert      knowledge  MEASUREMENTS: The measurements used were classifier performance,      training-set size efficiency, and classifier creation cost  RESULTS: Expert      knowledge was shown to be the most significant factor affecting inductive      learning performance, outweighing differences in learning algorithms  The use of       expert knowledge can affect comparisons between learning algorithms  This expert       knowledge may be obtained and represented separately as knowledge about the      clinical task or about the data representation used  The benefit of the expert      knowledge is more than that of inductive learning itself, with less cost to      obtain  CONCLUSION: For medical text report classification, expert knowledge      acquisition is more significant to performance and more cost-effective to obtain       than knowledge discovery  Building classifiers should therefore focus more on      acquiring knowledge from experts than trying to learn this knowledge inductively

PMID- 12626375   - OBJECTIVE: Develop a detailed representation of pharmacokinetics  PK , derived      from the information in Summaries of Product Characteristics  SPCs , for use in      computerized systems to help practitioners in pharmaco-therapeutic reasoning       METHODS: Available knowledge about PK was studied to identify main PK concepts      and organize them in a preliminary generic model  The information from 1950 PK      SPC-texts in the French language was studied using a morpho-syntactic analyzer       It produced a list of candidate terms  CTs  from which those describing main PK      concepts were selected  The contexts in which they occurred were explored to      discover co-occurring CTs  The regrouping according to CT semantic types led to a      detailed object-oriented model of PK  The model was evaluated  A random sample of      100 PK texts structured according to the model was judged for completeness and      semantic accuracy by 8 experts who were blinded to other experts' responses       RESULTS: The PK text file contained about 300000 words, and the morpho-syntactic       analysis extracted 17520 different CTs  The context of 592 CTs was studied and      used to deduce the PK model  It consists of four entities: the information about       the real PK process, the experimental protocol, the mathematical modeling, and      the influence of factors causing variation  Experts judged that the PK model      represented the information in 100 sample PK texts completely in 89% of cases and      nearly completely in the other 11%  There was no distortion of meaning in 98% of       cases and little distortion in the remainder  CONCLUSION: The PK model seems to      be applicable to all SPCs and can be used to retranscribe legal information from       PK sections of SPCs into structured databases

PMID- 12626374   - The availability of scientific bibliographies through online databases provides a      rich source of information for scientists to support their research  However, the      risk of this pervasive availability is that an individual researcher may fail to       find relevant information that is outside the direct scope of interest  Following      Swanson's ABC model of disjoint but complementary structures in the biomedical      literature, we have developed a discovery support tool to systematically analyze       the scientific literature in order to generate novel and plausible hypotheses  In      this case report, we employ the system to find potentially new target diseases      for the drug thalidomide  We find solid bibliographic evidence suggesting that      thalidomide might be useful for treating acute pancreatitis, chronic hepatitis C,      Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis, and myasthenia gravis  However,      experimental and clinical evaluation is needed to validate these hypotheses and      to assess the trade-off between therapeutic benefits and toxicities

PMID- 12626373   - We reviewed the English and Dutch literature on evaluations of patient care      information systems that require data entry by health care professionals      published from 1991 to 2001  Our objectives were to identify attributes that were      used to assess the success of such systems and to test the ability of a framework      developed by Delone and McLean for management information systems 1  to      categorize these attributes correctly  The framework includes six dimensions or     success factors: system quality, information quality, usage, user satisfaction,      individual impact, and organizational impact  Thirty-three papers were selected      for complete review  Types of study design included descriptive, correlational,      comparative, and case studies  A variety of relevant attributes could be assigned      to the six dimensions in the Delone and McLean framework, but some attributes,      predominantly in cases of failure, did not fit any of the categories  They      related to contingent factors, such as organizational culture  Our review points       out the need for more thorough evaluations of patient care information systems      that look at a wide range of factors that can affect the relative success or     failure of these systems

PMID- 12595409   - OBJECTIVE: Given the slow adoption of medical informatics in Hong Kong and Asia,       we sought to understand the contributory barriers and potential incentives      associated with information technology implementation  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: A      representative sample of 949 doctors  response rate = 77 0%  was asked through a       postal survey to rank a list of nine barriers associated with clinical      computerization according to self-perceived importance  They ranked seven      incentives or catalysts that may influence computerization  We generated mean      rank scores and used multidimensional preference analysis to explore key      explanatory dimensions of these variables  A hierarchical cluster analysis was      performed to identify homogenous subgroups of respondents  We further determined       the relationships between the sets of barriers and incentives/catalysts      collectively using canonical correlation  RESULTS: Time costs, lack of technical       support and large capital investments were the biggest barriers to      computerization, whereas improved office efficiency and better-quality care were       ranked highest as potential incentives to computerize  Cost vs  noncost,      physician-related vs  patient-related, and monetary vs  nonmonetary factors were       the key dimensions explaining the barrier variables  Similarly, within-practice      vs external and "push" vs "pull" factors accounted for the incentive variables       Four clusters were identified for barriers and three for incentives/catalysts       Canonical correlation revealed that respondents who were concerned with the costs      of computerization also perceived financial incentives and government regulation       to be important incentives/catalysts toward computerization  Those who found the       potential interference with communication important also believed that the      promise of improved care from computerization to be a significant incentive       CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence regarding common barriers associated      with clinical computerization  Our findings also identified possible incentive      strategies that may be employed to accelerate uptake of computer systems

PMID- 12595407   - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of computer-generated reminders on nurse      charting deficiencies in two intensive care units  DESIGN: Nurses caring for a      group of 60 study patients received patient-specific paper reminder reports when       charting deficiencies were found at mid-day  Nurses caring for a group of 60      control patients received no reminders  A group of 60 retrospective patients was       also formed  MEASUREMENTS: The average numbers of charting deficiencies at the      end of the shift in each of the three groups were compared using two planned      orthogonal contrasts  RESULTS: The average in the study group patients was 1 02      deficiencies per day per patient, whereas the control group the average was 1 40       deficiencies per day per patient  p = 0 001   The average number of end-of-shift       deficiencies in the pooled prospective  study/control  population was 1 21      deficiencies per day per patient, compared with the average in the retrospective       group of 1 56 deficiencies per day per patient  p < 0 001   CONCLUSION: The      decrease was likely due both to the appropriate response of the nurses to the      reminders and to a learned attentiveness to the tasks on the part of the nurses      who cared for study patients  Greater gains were hindered by incomplete      "coupling" of the reminders to the end-of-shift deficiencies and by inaccuracies       in the reminders

PMID- 12595402   - The Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act  HIPPA  stipulates that patients      must be permitted to review and amend their medical records  As information      technology makes medical records more accessible to patients, it may become more       commonplace for patients to review their records routinely  This article analyzes      the potential benefits and drawbacks of facilitating patient access to the      medical record by reviewing previously published research  Previous research      includes analysis of clinical notes, surveys of patients and practitioners, and      studies of patient-accessible medical records  Overall, studies suggest the      potential for modest benefits  for instance, in enhancing doctor-patient      communication   Risks  for instance, increasing patient worry or confusion       appear to be minimal in medical patients  The studies, however, were of limited      quality and low statistical power to detect the variety of outcomes that may      result from implementation of a patient-accessible medical record  The data from       these studies lay the foundation for future research

PMID- 12595401   - CONTEXT: Although patient safety is a major problem, most health care      organizations rely on spontaneous reporting, which detects only a small minority       of adverse events  As a result, problems with safety have remained hidden  Chart       review can detect adverse events in research settings, but it is too expensive      for routine use  Information technology techniques can detect some adverse events      in a timely and cost-effective way, in some cases early enough to prevent patient      harm  OBJECTIVE: To review methodologies of detecting adverse events using      information technology, reports of studies that used these techniques to detect      adverse events, and study results for specific types of adverse events  DESIGN:      Structured review  METHODOLOGY: English-language studies that reported using      information technology to detect adverse events were identified using standard      techniques  Only studies that contained original data were included  MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURES: Adverse events, with specific focus on nosocomial infections, adverse      drug events, and injurious falls  RESULTS: Tools such as event monitoring and      natural language processing can inexpensively detect certain types of adverse      events in clinical databases  These approaches already work well for some types      of adverse events, including adverse drug events and nosocomial infections, and      are in routine use in a few hospitals  In addition, it appears likely that these       techniques will be adaptable in ways that allow detection of a broad array of      adverse events, especially as more medical information becomes computerized       CONCLUSION: Computerized detection of adverse events will soon be practical on a       widespread basis

PMID- 12509359   - OBJECTIVE: Speech recognition promises to reduce information entry costs for     clinical information systems  It is most likely to be accepted across an      organization if physicians can dictate without concerning themselves with      real-time recognition and editing; assistants can then edit and process the      computer-generated document  Our objective was to evaluate the use of      speech-recognition technology in a randomized controlled trial using our     institutional infrastructure  DESIGN: Clinical note dictation from physicians in       two specialty divisions was randomized to either a standard transcription process      or a speech-recognition process  Secretaries and transcriptionists also were      assigned randomly to each of these processes  MEASUREMENTS: The duration of each       dictation was measured  The amount of time spent processing a dictation to yield       a finished document also was measured  Secretarial and transcriptionist      productivity, defined as hours of secretary work per minute of dictation      processed, was determined for speech recognition and standard transcription       RESULTS: Secretaries in the endocrinology division were 87 3%  confidence      interval, 83 3%, 92 3%  as productive with the speech-recognition technology as      implemented in this study as they were using standard transcription  Psychiatry      transcriptionists and secretaries were similarly less productive  Author,      secretary, and type of clinical note were significant  p < 0 05  predictors of      productivity  CONCLUSION: When implemented in an organization with an existing      document-processing infrastructure  which included training and interfaces of the      speech-recognition editor with the existing document entry application , speech      recognition did not improve the productivity of secretaries or transcriptionists

PMID- 12509358   - OBJECTIVES: The documentation of the nursing process is an important but often      neglected part of clinical documentation  Paper-based systems have been      introduced to support nursing process documentation  Frequently, however,      problems such as low quality of documentation are reported  It is unclear whether     computer-based documentation systems can reduce these problems and which factors       influence their acceptance by users  DESIGN: We introduced a computer-based      nursing documentation system on four wards of the University Hospitals of      Heidelberg and systematically evaluated its preconditions and its effects in a      pretest-posttest intervention study  For the analysis of user acceptance, we      concentrated on subjective data drawn from questionnaires and interviews       MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire was developed using items from published      questionnaires and items that had to be developed for the special purpose of this      study  RESULTS: The quantitative results point to two factors influencing the      acceptance of a new computer-based documentation system: the previous acceptance       of the nursing process and the previous amount of self-confidence when using      computers  On one ward, the diverse acceptance scores heavily declined after the       introduction of the nursing documentation system  Explorative qualitative      analysis on this ward points to further success factors of computer-based nursing      documentation systems  CONCLUSION: Our results can be used to assist the planning      and introduction of computer-based nursing documentation systems  They      demonstrate the importance of computer experience and acceptance of the nursing      process on a ward but also point to other factors such as the fit between nursing      workflow and the functionality of a nursing documentation system

PMID- 12509357   - OBJECTIVES: Many groups are developing computer-interpretable clinical guidelines       CIGs  for use during clinical encounters  CIGs use "Task-Network Models" for     representation but differ in their approaches to addressing particular modeling      challenges  We have studied similarities and differences between CIGs in order to      identify issues that must be resolved before a consensus on a set of common      components can be developed  DESIGN: We compared six models: Asbru, EON, GLIF,      GUIDE, PRODIGY, and PROforma  Collaborators from groups that created these models      represented, in their own formalisms, portions of two guidelines: the American      College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine's guideline for     managing chronic cough and the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on      Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure       MEASUREMENTS: We compared the models according to eight components that capture      the structure of CIGs  The components enable modelers to encode guidelines as      plans that organize decision and action tasks in networks  They also enable the      encoded guidelines to be linked with patient data-a key requirement for enabling       patient-specific decision support  RESULTS: We found consensus on many      components, including plan organization, expression language, conceptual medical       record model, medical concept model, and data abstractions  Differences were most      apparent in underlying decision models, goal representation, use of scenarios,      and structured medical actions  CONCLUSION: We identified guideline components      that the CIG community could adopt as standards  Some of the participants are      pursuing standardization of these components under the auspices of HL7

PMID- 12509352   - Delivery of excellent primary care-central to overall medical care-demands that      providers have the necessary information when they give care  This paper,      developed by the National Alliance for Primary Care Informatics, a collaborative       group sponsored by a number of primary care societies, argues that providers' and      patients' information and decision support needs can be satisfied only if primary      care providers use electronic medical records  EMRs   Although robust EMRs are      now available, only about 5% of U S  primary care providers use them  Recently,      with only modest investments, Australia, New Zealand, and England have achieved      major breakthroughs in implementing EMRs in primary care  Substantial benefits      realizable through routine use of electronic medical records include improved      quality, safety, and efficiency, along with increased ability to conduct      education and research  Nevertheless, barriers to adoption exist and must be      overcome  Implementing specific policies can accelerate utilization of EMRs in      the U S

PMID- 12386188   - Is the solution for medical errors medical or cognitive? In this AMIA2001 panel      on medical error, we argued that medical error is primarily an issue for     cognitive science and engineering, not for medicine, although the knowledge of      the practice of medicine is essential for the research and prevention of medical       errors  The three panelists presented studies that demonstrate that cognitive      research is the foundation for theories of medical errors and interventions of      error reductions

PMID- 12386115   - OBJECTIVES: The search filters in PubMed have become a cornerstone in information      retrieval in evidence-based practice  However, the filter for diagnostic studies       is not fully satisfactory, because sensitive searches have low precision  The      objective of this study was to construct and validate better search strategies to      identify diagnostic articles recorded on MEDLINE with special emphasis on      precision  DESIGN: A comparative, retrospective analysis was conducted  Four     medical journals were hand-searched for diagnostic studies published in 1989 and       1994  Four other journals were hand-searched for 1999  The three sets of studies       identified were used as gold standards  A new search strategy was constructed and      tested using the 1989-subset of studies and validated in both the 1994 and 1999      subsets  We identified candidate text words for search strategies using a word      frequency analysis of the abstracts  According to the frequency of identified      terms, searches were run for each term independently  The sensitivity, precision,      and number needed to read  1/precision  of every candidate term were calculated        Terms with the highest sensitivity x precision product were used as free text      terms in combination with the MeSH term "SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY" using the      Boolean operator OR  In the 1994 and 1999 subsets, we performed head-to-head      comparisons of the currently available PubMed filter with the one we developed       MEASUREMENTS: The sensitivity, precision and the number needed to read       1/precision  were measured for different search filters  RESULTS: The most      frequently occurring three truncated terms  diagnos*; predict* and accura*  in      combination with the MeSH term "SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY" produced a      sensitivity of 98 1 percent  95% confidence interval: 89 9-99 9%  and a number     needed to read of 8 3  95% confidence interval: 6 7-11 3%   In direct comparisons      of the new filter with the currently available one in PubMed using the 1994 and      1999 subsets, the new filter achieved better precision  12 0% versus 8 2% in 1994      and 5 0% versus 4 3% in 1999  The 95% confidence intervals for the differences      range from 0 05% to 7 5%  p = 0 041  and -1 0% to 2 3%  p = 0 45 , respectively        The new filter achieved slightly better sensitivities than the currently      available one in both subsets, namely 98 1 and 96 1%  p = 0 32  versus 95 1 and      88 8%  p = 0 125   CONCLUSIONS: The quoted performance of the currently available      filter for diagnostic studies in PubMed may be overstated  It appears that even      single external validation may lead to over optimistic views of a filter's      performance  Precision appears to be more unstable than sensitivity  In terms of       sensitivity, our filter for diagnostic studies performed slightly better than the      currently available one and it performed better with regards to precision in the       1994 subset  Additional research is required to determine whether these      improvements are beneficial to searches in practice

PMID- 12386113   - Motivation  The UMLS has been used in natural language processing applications      such as information retrieval and information extraction systems  The mapping of       free-text to UMLS concepts is important for these applications  To improve the      mapping, we need a method to disambiguate terms that possess multiple UMLS      concepts  In the general English domain, machine-learning techniques have been      applied to sense-tagged corpora, in which senses  or concepts  of ambiguous terms      have been annotated  mostly manually   Sense disambiguation classifiers are then       derived to determine senses  or concepts  of those ambiguous terms automatically       However, manual annotation of a corpus is an expensive task  We propose an      automatic method that constructs sense-tagged corpora for ambiguous terms in the       UMLS using MEDLINE abstracts  METHODS: For a term W that represents multiple UMLS      concepts, a collection of MEDLINE abstracts that contain W is extracted  For each      abstract in the collection, occurrences of concepts that have relations with W as      defined in the UMLS are automatically identified  A sense-tagged corpus, in which      senses of W are annotated, is then derived based on those identified concepts       The method was evaluated on a set of 35 frequently occurring ambiguous biomedical      abbreviations using a gold standard set that was automatically derived  The      quality of the derived sense-tagged corpus was measured using precision and      recall  RESULTS: The derived sense-tagged corpus had an overall precision of      92 9% and an overall recall of 47 4%  After removing rare senses and ignoring      abbreviations with closely related senses, the overall precision was 96 8% and      the overall recall was 50 6%  CONCLUSIONS: UMLS conceptual relations and MEDLINE       abstracts can be used to automatically acquire knowledge needed for resolving      ambiguity when mapping free-text to UMLS concepts

PMID- 12386112   - OBJECTIVE: The growth of the biomedical literature presents special challenges      for both human readers and automatic algorithms  One such challenge derives from       the common and uncontrolled use of abbreviations in the literature  Each      additional abbreviation increases the effective size of the vocabulary for a      field  Therefore, to create an automatically generated and maintained lexicon of       abbreviations, we have developed an algorithm to match abbreviations in text with      their expansions  DESIGN: Our method uses a statistical learning algorithm,      logistic regression, to score abbreviation expansions based on their resemblance       to a training set of human-annotated abbreviations  We applied it to Medstract, a      corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in which abbreviations and their expansions have been      manually annotated  We then ran the algorithm on all abstracts in MEDLINE,      creating a dictionary of biomedical abbreviations  To test the coverage of the      database, we used an independently created list of abbreviations from the China      Medical Tribune  MEASUREMENTS: We measured the recall and precision of the      algorithm in identifying abbreviations from the Medstract corpus  We also      measured the recall when searching for abbreviations from the China Medical      Tribune against the database  RESULTS: On the Medstract corpus, our algorithm      achieves up to 83% recall at 80% precision  Applying the algorithm to all of      MEDLINE yielded a database of 781,632 high-scoring abbreviations  Of all the      abbreviations in the list from the China Medical Tribune, 88% were in the      database  CONCLUSION: We have developed an algorithm to identify abbreviations      from text  We are making this available as a public abbreviation server at      \url[http://abbreviation stanford edu/]

PMID- 12386110   - OBJECTIVE: To extend the Clinical LOINC  Logical Observation Identifiers, Names,       and Codes  semantic schema to support  1  the representation of common types of      assessment instruments and  2  the disambiguation of versions and variants that      may have differing reliability and validity  DESIGN: Psychometric theory and      survey research framework, plus an existing tool for implementing many types of      assessment instruments  Dialogix , were used to identify and model the attributes      of instruments that affect reliability and validity  Four modifications to the      LOINC semantic schema were proposed as a means for completely identifying,      disambiguating, and operationalizing a broad range of assessment instruments       MEASUREMENTS: Assess the feasibility of modeling these attributes within LOINC,      with and without the proposed extensions  RESULTS: The existing LOINC schema for       supporting assessment instruments was unable to consistently meet either     objective  In contrast, the proposed extensions were able to meet both      objectives, because they are derived from the Dialogix schema, which already      performs those tasks  CONCLUSION: These extensions to LOINC can facilitate the      use, analysis, and improvement of assessment instruments and thereby may improve       the detection and management of errors

PMID- 12223506   - OBJECTIVE: In addition to providing new capabilities, the introduction of      technology in complex, sociotechnical systems, such as health care and aviation,       can have unanticipated side effects on technical, social, and organizational      dimensions  To identify potential accidents in the making, the authors looked for     side effects from a natural experiment, the implementation of bar code medication      administration  BCMA , a technology designed to reduce adverse drug events       ADEs   DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study of medication passes before       21 hours of observation of 7 nurses at 1 hospital  and after  60 hours of      observation of 26 nurses at 3 hospitals  BCMA implementation  MEASUREMENTS:      Detailed, handwritten field notes of targeted ethnographic observations of in      situ nurse-BCMA interactions were iteratively analyzed using process tracing and       five conceptual frameworks  RESULTS: Ethnographic observations distilled into 67       nurse-BCMA interactions were classified into 12 categories  We identified five      negative side effects after BCMA implementation:  1  nurses confused by automated      removal of medications by BCMA,  2  degraded coordination between nurses and      physicians,  3  nurses dropping activities to reduce workload during busy      periods,  4  increased prioritization of monitored activities during goal      conflicts, and  5  decreased ability to deviate from routine sequences       CONCLUSION: These side effects might create new paths to ADEs  We recommend      design revisions, modification of organizational policies, and "best practices"      training that could potentially minimize or eliminate these side effects before      they contribute to adverse outcomes

PMID- 12223504   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a technique for recognizing critical situations based on      laboratory results in settings in which a normal range cannot be defined, because      what is "normal" differs widely from patient to patient  To assess the potential       of this approach for kidney transplant recipients, where recognition of acute      rejections is based on the pattern of changes in serum creatinine  DESIGN: We      developed a case-based reasoning algorithm using dynamic time-warping as the      measure of similarity which allows comparison of series of infrequent      measurements at irregular intervals for retrieval of the most similar historical       cases for the assessment of a new situation  MEASUREMENTS: The ability to      recognize creatinine courses associated with an acute rejection was tested for a       set of cases from a database of transplant patient records and compared with the       diagnostic performance of experienced physicians  Tests were performed with case       bases of various sizes  RESULTS: The accuracy of the algorithm increased steadily      with the size of the available case base  With the largest case bases, the      case-based algorithm reached an accuracy of 78 +/- 2%, which is significantly      higher than the performance of experienced physicians  69 +/- 5 3%   p < 0 001         CONCLUSION: The new case-based reasoning algorithm with dynamic time warping as      the measure of similarity allows extension of the use of automatic laboratory      alerting systems to conditions in which abnormal laboratory results are the norm       and critical states can be detected only by recognition of pathological changes      over time

PMID- 12223502   - Computer technology from the management of individual patient medical records to       the tracking of epidemiologic trends has become an essential part of all aspects       of modern medicine  Consequently, computers, including bedside components,      point-of-care testing equipment, and handheld computer devices, are increasingly       present in patients' rooms  Recent articles have indicated that computer     hardware, just as other medical equipment, may act as a reservoir for     microorganisms and contribute to the transfer of pathogens to patients  This      article presents basic microbiological concepts relative to infection, reviews      the present literature concerning possible links between computer contamination      and nosocomial colonizations and infections, discusses basic principles for the      control of contamination, and provides guidelines for reducing the risk of      transfer of microorganisms to susceptible patient populations

PMID- 12223501   - This case study describes a project that explores issues of quality of service       QoS  relevant to the next-generation Internet  NGI , using the PathMaster     application in a testbed environment  PathMaster is a prototype computer system      that analyzes digitized cell images from cytology specimens and compares those      images against an image database, returning a ranked set of "similar" cell images      from the database  To perform NGI testbed evaluations, we used a cluster of nine       parallel computation workstations configured as three subclusters using Cisco      routers  This architecture provides a local "simulated Internet" in which we      explored the following QoS strategies:  1  first-in-first-out queuing,  2       priority queuing,  3  weighted fair queuing,  4  weighted random early detection,      and  5  traffic shaping  The study describes the results of using these      strategies with a distributed version of the PathMaster system in the presence of      different amounts of competing network traffic and discusses certain of the      issues that arise  The goal of the study is to help introduce NGI QoS issues to      the Medical Informatics community and to use the PathMaster NGI testbed to      illustrate concretely certain of the QoS issues that arise

PMID- 12223500   - BACKGROUND: The annual cost of morbidity and mortality due to medication errors      in the U S  has been estimated at $76 6 billion  Information technology      implemented systematically has the potential to significantly reduce medication      errors that result in adverse drug events  ADEs   OBJECTIVE: To develop a      computer simulation model that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of      information technology applications designed to detect and prevent medication      errors that result in adverse drug effects  METHODS: A computer simulation model       was constructed representing the medication delivery system in a hospital       STELLA, a continuous simulation software package, was used to construct the      model  Parameters of the model were estimated from a study of prescription errors      on two hospital medical/surgical units and used in the baseline simulation  Five       prevention strategies were simulated based on information obtained from the      literature  RESULTS: The model simulates the four stages of the medication      delivery system: prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, and administering drugs        We simulated interventions that have been demonstrated in prior studies to      decrease error rates  The results suggest that an integrated medication delivery       system can save up to 1,226 days of excess hospitalization and $1 4 million in      associated costs annually in a large hospital  The results of the analyses      regarding the effects of the interventions on the additional hospital costs      associated with ADEs are somewhat sensitive to the distribution of errors in the       hospital, more sensitive to the costs of an ADE, and most sensitive to the      proportion of medication errors resulting in ADEs  CONCLUSIONS: The results      suggest that clinical information systems are potentially a cost-effective means       of preventing ADEs in hospitals and demonstrate the importance of viewing      medication errors from a systems perspective  Prevention efforts that focus on a       single stage of the process had limited impact on the overall error rate  This      study suggests that system-wide changes to the medication delivery system are      required to drastically reduce mediation errors that may result in ADEs in a      hospital setting

PMID- 12223499   - Usability evaluations are a powerful tool that can assist developers in their     efforts to optimize the quality of their web environment  This underutilized,      experimental method can serve to move applications toward true user-centered      design  This article describes the usability methodology and illustrates its      importance and application by describing a usability study undertaken at the Mayo      Clinic for the purpose of improving an academic research web environment       Academic institutions struggling in an era of declining reimbursements are      finding it difficult to maintain academic enterprises on the back of clinical      revenues  This may result in declining amounts of time that clinical      investigators have to spend in non-patient-related activities  For this reason,      we have undertaken to design a web environment, which can minimize the time that       a clinician-investigator needs to spend to accomplish academic instrumental      activities of daily living  Usability evaluation is a powerful application of      human factors engineering, which can improve the utility of web-based Informatics      applications

PMID- 12223498   - The analytical representation and simulation of complex molecular pathways can      contribute to understanding and evaluating physiological as well as pathological       processes  We are interested in modeling the processes of menopause to stratify      women in terms of the genotypic and environmental components and their     implications for development of individualized risk of postmenopausal disorders,       e g , breast and ovarian cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis  We      have initiated this study using the UltraSAN package to analyze the pathway      associated with estrogen production  This model incorporates detailed information      about the hormone factors affecting estrogen production, and the simulations      carried out are based on published experimental data corresponding to hormone      levels during the course of the normal female reproductive cycle  The agreement      between the experimental data and the simulation is typically less than 2 ng/ml      or 2 pg/ml respectively for progesterone and estradiol output  This approach      further permits inclusion of information about an SNP observed in the gene coding      for the enzyme aromatase as a model to study the impact of reduced enzymatic      activity on hormone levels

PMID- 12223496   - Learning anatomy and surgical procedures requires both a conceptual understanding      of three-dimensional anatomy and a hands-on manipulation of tools and tissue       Such virtual resources are not available widely, are expensive, and may be      culturally disallowed  Simulation technology, using high-performance computers      and graphics, permits realistic real-time display of anatomy  Haptics technology       supports the ability to probe and feel this virtual anatomy through the use of      virtual tools  The Internet permits world-wide access to resources  We have      brought together high-performance servers and high-bandwidth communication using       the Next Generation Internet and complex bimanual haptics to simulate a      tool-based learning environment for wide use  This article presents the      technologic basis of this environment and some evaluation of its use in the gross      anatomy course at Stanford University

PMID- 12087118   - Clinical study data management systems  CSDMSs  have many similarities to      clinical patient record systems  CPRSs  in their focus on recording clinical      parameters  Requirements for ad hoc query interfaces for both systems would      therefore appear to be highly similar  However, a clinical study is concerned      primarily with collective responses of groups of subjects to standardized      therapeutic interventions for the same underlying clinical condition  The      parameters that are recorded in CSDMSs tend to be more diverse than those      required for patient management in non-research settings, because of the greater       emphasis on questionnaires for which responses to each question are recorded      separately  The differences between CSDMSs and CPRSs are reflected in the      metadata that support the respective systems' operation, and need to be reflected      in the query interfaces  The authors describe major revisions of their previously      described CSDMS ad hoc query interface to meet CSDMS needs more fully, as well as      its porting to a Web-based platform

PMID- 12087117   - The Arden Syntax was introduced more than 10 years ago, but it is still not in      widespread use  One reason might be that for each particular architecture and      information system, a different Arden Syntax compiler must be written as well as       a program for the runtime execution of the medical logic modules  MLMs   The      authors have designed and implemented an architecture that increases the      portability of Arden Syntax rules, using the Java platform  The portability to a       target information system is achieved by the addition of appropriate adapter     components, which they call mappers  These mappers are dynamically selected using      explicit and implicit elements of MLMs  Furthermore, they can help translate data      from the clinical information system representation into the representation      needed by an MLM  This was validated by an experiment in two clinical units       Also, the authors propose a convention to name signals that trigger other MLMs       called intermediate states  so that they remain unique to each institution  The       authors implemented this architecture in their clinical system and in an      XML-based medical record application that has been used experimentally in their     urology and nephrology departments  The Tetrasys company that provided the      medical record was able to incorporate their runtime without modifications, and      typical MLM execution time was less than 1 sec

PMID- 12087116   - A systematic search of seven electronic databases was done to identify randomized      controlled trials that assessed the effect of computer-generated patient      education material  PEM  on professional practice  Three studies met the authors'      criteria  All three studies involved preventive care  All used a complex      intervention of which computer-generated PEM was a major component  Improvements       in practice were seen in all studies, although these gains were generally modest       One study showed improvement in patient outcomes  Mann-Whitney statistics      calculated for the studies' outcome measures ranged from 0 48 to 0 66, equivalent      to risk differences of -4 to 32 percent  Computer-generated PEM seems to have a      small, positive effect on professional practice  The small number of included      studies and the complex nature of the interventions makes it difficult to draw      conclusions about the ability of computer-generated PEM to change professional      practice  Future work should involve well-defined interventions that can be      clearly evaluated in terms of effect and cost

PMID- 11971887   - OBJECTIVE: To develop methods that automatically map abbreviations to their full       forms in biomedical articles  METHODS: The authors developed two methods of      mapping defined and undefined abbreviations  defined abbreviations are paired      with their full forms in the articles, whereas undefined ones are not   For     defined abbreviations, they developed a set of pattern-matching rules to map an      abbreviation to its full form and implemented the rules into a software program,       AbbRE  for "abbreviation recognition and extraction"   Using the opinions of      domain experts as a reference standard, they evaluated the recall and precision      of AbbRE for defined abbreviations in ten biomedical articles randomly selected      from the ten most frequently cited medical and biological journals  They also      measured the percentage of undefined abbreviations in the same set of articles,      and they investigated whether they could map undefined abbreviations to any of      four public abbreviation databases  GenBank LocusLink, SWISSPROT, LRABR of the      UMLS Specialist Lexicon, and BioABACUS   RESULTS: AbbRE had an average 0 70      recall and 0 95 precision for the defined abbreviations  The authors found that      an average of 25 percent of abbreviations were defined in biomedical articles and      that of a randomly selected subset of undefined abbreviations, 68 percent could      be mapped to any of four abbreviation databases  They also found that many      abbreviations are ambiguous  i e , they map to more than one full form in      abbreviation databases   CONCLUSION: AbbRE is efficient for mapping defined      abbreviations  To couple AbbRE with abbreviation databases for the mapping of      undefined abbreviations, not only exhaustive abbreviation databases but also a      method to resolve the ambiguity of abbreviations in the databases are needed

PMID- 11971884   - In medical informatics research, study questions frequently involve individuals      who are grouped into clusters  For example, an intervention may be aimed at a      clinician  who treats a cluster of patients  with the intention of improving the       health of individual patients  Correlation among individuals within a cluster can      lead to incorrect estimates of the sample size required to detect an effect and      inappropriate estimates of the confidence intervals and the statistical      significance of the intervention effects  Contamination, which is the spread of      the effect of an intervention or control treatment to the opposite group, often      occurs between individuals within clusters  It leads to an attenuation of the      effect of the intervention and reduced power to detect a difference  If      individuals are randomized in a clinical trial  individual-randomized trial ,      then correlation must be taken into account in the analysis, and the sample size       may need to be increased to compensate for contamination  Randomizing clusters      rather than individuals  cluster-randomized trials  can eliminate contamination      and may be preferred for logistical reasons  Cluster-randomized trials are      generally less efficient than individual-randomized trials, so the tradeoffs must      be assessed  Correlation must be taken into account in the analysis and in the      sample-size calculations for cluster-randomized trials

PMID- 11971883   - OBJECTIVE: Problems involving drug knowledge are one of the most common causes of      serious medication errors  Although the information that clinicians need is often      available somewhere, retrieving it expeditiously has been problematic  At the      same time, clinicians are faced with an ever-expanding pharmacology knowledge      base  Recently, point-of-care technology has become more widely available and      more practical with the advent of handheld, or palmtop, computing  Therefore, the      authors evaluated the clinical contribution of a drug database developed for the       handheld computer  ePocrates Rx  formerly known as qRx; ePocrates, San Carlos,      California  is a comprehensive drug information guide that is downloadable free      from the Internet and designed for the Palm OS platform align="right"  DESIGN: A       seven-day online survey of 3,000 randomly selected ePocrates Rx users was      conducted during March 2000  MEASUREMENTS: User technology experience, product      evaluation and usage patterns, and the effects of the drug reference database on       information-seeking behavior, practice efficiency, decision making, and patient      care  RESULTS: The survey response rate was 32 percent  n=946   Physicians      reported that ePocrates Rx saves time during information retrieval, is easily      incorporated into their usual workflow, and improves drug-related decision      making  They also felt that it reduced the rate of preventable adverse drug      events  CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported perceptions by responding clinicians endorse      improved access to drug information and improved practice efficiency associated      with the use of handheld devices  The clinical and practical value of using these      devices in clinical settings will clearly grow further as wireless communication       becomes more ubiquitous and as more applications become available

PMID- 11971882   - The authors developed a novel feature in their clinical information systems,      which allows clinicians to request notification about laboratory results       Clinicians who are expecting a particular laboratory result for a particular     patient can request a report of the result via an alphanumeric pager as soon as      the result is filed into the patient database  This feature has gained popularity      and is heavily used in both inpatient and outpatient settings, at a rate of about      2,300 times per month  This event-monitor-based feature illustrates one way that       information technology can be applied to improve communication in health care

PMID- 11971881   - Electronic communication among clinicians and patients is becoming an essential      part of medical practice  Evaluation and selection of these electronic systems,      called personal clinical electronic communication  PCEC  systems, can be a      difficult task in institutions that have no prior experience with such systems       It is particularly difficult in the clinical context  To directly address this      point, the authors consulted a group of potential users affiliated with a      nationally recognized telemedicine project, to determine important      characteristics of a hypothetical PCEC system  They compiled a list of these      characteristics and produced a desiderata, or list of desired features, for PCEC       systems  Two conventional e-mail implementations and three Web-based PCEC systems      were evaluated with respect to the features  The Web-based systems all scored      higher than conventional e-mail  It is the hope of the authors that this paper     will initiate further discussions about the features of PCEC systems and how to      evaluate them

PMID- 11971880   - The 2001 debate of the American College of Medical Informatics focused on the      proposition that national regulatory mandate of computer-based provider order     entry  CPOE , to take effect by the end of 2005, portends greater benefit than      risk for health care delivery  Both sides accepted that provider order entry      offers potential benefit  Those supporting the proposition emphasized public      safety, noting that payers have little economic incentive to pay for quality and       that a mandate would force vendors to improve the usability and value of their     systems  They argued that the mandate would align the economic incentives to      finally allow CPOE to be widely adopted  Those opposing the proposition      emphasized the risks resulting from a mandate, including the direct      implementation costs, the logistic issues of implementation, and the cost of      failed implementations  They also noted the potential for errors introduced by      the systems themselves and the fact that the safety and utility of commercially      available CPOE products have yet to be proved

PMID- 11861634   - OBJECTIVE: Despite an increasing movement toward shared decision making and the      incorporation of patients' preferences into health care decision making, little      research has been done on the development and evaluation of support systems that       help clinicians elicit and integrate patients' preferences into patient care       This study evaluates nurses' use of CHOICE, a handheld-computer-based support      system for preference-based care planning, which assists nurses in eliciting      patients' preferences for functional performance at the bedside  Specifically, it      evaluates the effects of system use on nurses' care priorities, preference      achievement, and patients' satisfaction  DESIGN: Three-group sequential design      with one intervention and two control groups  N=155   In the intervention group,       nurses elicited patients' preferences for functional performance with the      handheld-computer-based CHOICE application as part of their regular admission      interview; preference information was added to patients' charts and used in      subsequent care planning  RESULTS: Nurses' use of CHOICE made nursing care more      consistent with patient preferences  F=11 4; P<0 001  and improved patients'      preference achievement  F=4 9; P<0 05   Furthermore, higher consistency between      patients' preferences and nurses' care priorities was associated with higher     preference achievement  r=0 49; P<0 001   CONCLUSION: In this study, the use of a      handheld-computer-based support system for preference-based care planning      improved patient-centered care and patient outcomes  The technique has potential       to be included in clinical practice as part of nurses' routine care planning

PMID- 11861628   - Stanford's two decades of success in linking medical informatics and health      services research in both training and investigational activities reflects      advantageous geography and history as well as natural synergies in the two areas       Health services research and medical informatics at Stanford have long shared a      quantitative, analytic orientation, along with linked administration, curriculum,      and clinical activities  Both the medical informatics and the health services      research curricula draw on diverse course offerings throughout the university,      and both the training and research overlap in such areas as outcomes research,      large database analysis, and decision analysis/decision support  The Stanford      experience suggests that successful integration of programs in medical      informatics and health services research requires areas of overlapping or     synergistic interest and activity among the involved faculty and, hence, in time,      among the students  This is enhanced by a mixture of casual and structured      contact among students from both disciplines, including social interactions  The       challenges to integration are how to overcome any geographic separation that may       exist in a given institution; the proper management of relationships with those      sub-areas of medical informatics that have less overlap with health services      research; and the need to determine how best to exploit opportunities for     collaboration that naturally occur

PMID- 11861627   - Reams of data pertaining directly to the core health services research mission      are accumulating in large-scale organizational and clinical information systems        Health services researchers who grasp the structure of information systems and      databases and the function of software applications can use existing data more      effectively, assist in establishing new databases, and develop new tools to      survey populations and collect data  At the same time, informaticians are needed       who can structure databases that serve the needs of health service research and      who can design and evaluate applications that effectively improve health care      delivery  As long as health services researchers and informaticians work in      separate spheres, however, opportunities to use data from health care encounters       to improve care, expand knowledge, and develop more effective policies will be      missed  This paper provides a brief exploration of 1  existing successful      collaborations between health services researchers and informaticians and 2       needs and opportunities for additional joint work in several core research areas

PMID- 11861624   - The events that followed the launch of Sputnik on Oct 4, 1957, provide a metaphor     for the events that are following the first bioterroristic case of pulmonary      anthrax in the United States  This paper uses that metaphor to elucidate the      nature of the task ahead and to suggest questions such as, Can the goals of the      biodefense effort be formulated as concisely and concretely as the goal of the      space program? Can we measure success in biodefense as we did for the space      project? What are the existing resources that are the equivalents of propulsion      systems and rocket engineers that can be applied to the problems of biodefense?

PMID- 11751801   - The Columbia University Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine      IDEATel  project is a four-year demonstration project funded by the Centers for     Medicare and Medicaid Services with the overall goal of evaluating the      feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of      telemedicine  The focal point of the intervention is the home telemedicine unit       HTU , which provides four functions: synchronous videoconferencing over standard      telephone lines, electronic transmission for fingerstick glucose and blood      pressure readings, secure Web-based messaging and clinical data review, and      access to Web-based educational materials  The HTU must be usable by elderly      patients with no prior computer experience  Providing these functions through the      HTU requires tight integration of six components: the HTU itself, case management      software, a clinical information system, Web-based educational material, data      security, and networking and telecommunications  These six components were      integrated through a variety of interfaces, providing a system that works well      for patients and providers  With more than 400 HTUs installed, IDEATel has      demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale home telemedicine

PMID- 11751800   - The benefits of computerized physician order entry have been widely recognized,      although few institutions have successfully installed these systems  Obstacles to      successful implementation are organizational as well as technical  In the spring       of 2000, following a 4-year period of planning and customization, a 9-month pilot      project, and a 14-month hiatus for year 2000, the Ohio State University Health      System extensively implemented physician order entry across inpatient units       Implementation for specialty and community services is targeted for completion in      2002  On implemented units, all orders are processed through the system, with 80       percent being entered by physicians and the rest by nursing or other licensed      care providers  The system is deployable across diverse clinical environments,      focused on physicians as the primary users, and accepted by clinicians  These are      the three criteria by which the authors measured the success of their     implementation  They believe that the availability of specialty-specific order     sets, the engagement of physician leadership, and a large-scale system      implementation were key strategic factors that enabled physician-users to accept       a physician order entry system despite significant changes in workflow

PMID- 11751799   - Medical informatics systems are often designed to perform at the level of human      experts  Evaluation of the performance of these systems is often constrained by      lack of reference standards, either because the appropriate response is not known      or because no simple appropriate response exists  Even when performance can be      assessed, it is not always clear whether the performance is sufficient or     reasonable  These challenges can be addressed if an evaluator enlists the help of      clinical domain experts  1  The experts can carry out the same tasks as the      system, and then their responses can be combined to generate a reference      standard  2 The experts can judge the appropriateness of system output directly        3  The experts can serve as comparison subjects with which the system can be      compared  These are separate roles that have different implications for study      design, metrics, and issues of reliability and validity  Diagrams help delineate       the roles of experts in complex study designs

PMID- 11687568   - Consenting visitors to a health survey Web site were randomly assigned to a      "matrix" presentation or an "expanded" presentation of survey response options       Among 4,208 visitors to the site over 3 months, 1,615  38 percent  participated      by giving consent and completing the survey  During a pre-trial period, when      consent was not required, 914 of 1,667 visitors  55 percent  participated  odds      ratio 1 9, P<0 0001   Mean response times were 5 07 minutes for the matrix format      and 5 22 minutes for the expanded format  P=0 16   Neither health status scores      nor alpha reliability coefficients were substantially influenced by the survey      format, but health status scores varied with age and gender as expected from U S       population norms  In conclusion, presenting response options in a matrix format      may not substantially speed survey completion  This study demonstrates a method      for rapidly evaluating interface design alternatives using anonymous Web      volunteers who have provided informed consent

PMID- 11687567   - OBJECTIVE: To assess physician-patient communication patterns associated with use      of an electronic medical record  EMR  system in an outpatient setting and provide      an empirical foundation for larger studies  DESIGN: An exploratory, observational      study involving analysis of videotaped physician-patient encounters,      questionnaires, and medical-record reviews  SETTING: General internal medicine      practice at an academic medical center  PARTICIPANTS: Three physicians who used      an EMR system  EMR physicians  and three who used solely a paper record  control       physicians   A total of 204 patient visits were included in the analysis  mean,      34 for each physician   Main Outcome Measures: Content analysis of whether     physicians accomplished communication tasks during encounters; qualitative      analysis of how EMR physicians used the EMR and how control physicians used the      paper chart  RESULTS: Compared with the control physicians, EMR physicians      adopted a more active role in clarifying information, encouraging questions, and       ensuring completeness at the end of a visit  A trend suggested that EMR     physicians might be less active than control physicians in three somewhat more      patient-centered areas  outlining the patient's agenda, exploring psychosocial/      emotional issues, discussing how health problems affect a patient's life        Physicians in both groups tended to direct their attention to the patient record       during the initial portion of the encounter  The relatively fixed position of the      computer limited the extent to which EMR physicians could physically orient      themselves toward the patient  Although there was no statistically significant      difference between the EMR and control physicians in terms of mean time across      all visits, a difference did emerge for initial visits: Initial visits with EMR     physicians took an average of 37 5 percent longer than those with control      physicians  SUMMARY: An EMR system may enhance the ability of physicians to      complete information-intensive tasks but can make it more difficult to focus      attention on other aspects of patient communication  Further study involving a      controlled, pre-/post-intervention design is justified

PMID- 11687566   - OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that most instances of negated concepts in      dictated medical documents can be detected by a strategy that relies on tools      developed for the parsing of formal  computer  languages-specifically, a lexical       scanner  "lexer"  that uses regular expressions to generate a finite state      machine, and a parser that relies on a restricted subset of context-free      grammars, known as LALR 1  grammars  METHODS: A diverse training set of 40      medical documents from a variety of specialties was manually inspected and used      to develop a program  Negfinder  that contained rules to recognize a large set of      negated patterns occurring in the text  Negfinder's lexer and parser were      developed using tools normally used to generate programming language compilers       The input to Negfinder consisted of medical narrative that was preprocessed to      recognize UMLS concepts: the text of a recognized concept had been replaced with       a coded representation that included its UMLS concept ID  The program generated      an index with one entry per instance of a concept in the document, where the      presence or absence of negation of that concept was recorded  This information      was used to mark up the text of each document by color-coding it to make it      easier to inspect  The parser was then evaluated in two ways: 1  a test set of 60      documents  30 discharge summaries, 30 surgical notes  marked-up by Negfinder was       inspected visually to quantify false-positive and false-negative results; and 2        a different test set of 10 documents was independently examined for negatives by       a human observer and by Negfinder, and the results were compared  RESULTS: In the      first evaluation using marked-up documents, 8,358 instances of UMLS concepts were      detected in the 60 documents, of which 544 were negations detected by the program      and verified by human observation  true-positive results, or TPs   Thirteen      instances were wrongly flagged as negated  false-positive results, or FPs , and      the program missed 27 instances of negation  false-negative results, or FNs ,      yielding a sensitivity of 95 3 percent and a specificity of 97 7 percent  In the       second evaluation using independent negation detection, 1,869 concepts were      detected in 10 documents, with 135 TPs, 12 FPs, and 6 FNs, yielding a sensitivity      of 95 7 percent and a specificity of 91 8 percent  One of the words "no,"      "denies/denied," "not," or "without" was present in 92 5 percent of all      negations  CONCLUSIONS: Negation of most concepts in medical narrative can be      reliably detected by a simple strategy  The reliability of detection depends on      several factors, the most important being the accuracy of concept matching

PMID- 11687565   - Abstract Public health is a complex discipline that has contributed substantially      to improving the health of the population  Public health action involves a      variety of interventions and methods, many of which are now taken for granted by       the general public  The specific focus and nature of public health interventions       continue to evolve, but the fundamental principles of public health remain      stable  These principles include a focus on the health of the population rather     than of individuals; an emphasis on disease prevention rather than treatment; a      goal of intervention at all vulnerable points in the causal pathway of disease,      injury, or disability; and operation in a governmental rather than a private      context  Public health practice occurs at local, state, and federal levels and      involves various professional disciplines  Public health principles and practice       are illustrated by a case study example of neural tube defects and folic acid       The application of information science and technology in public health practice      provides previously unfathomed opportunities to improve the health of the      population  Clinical informaticians and others in the health care system are      crucial partners in addressing the challenges and opportunities offered by public      health informatics

PMID- 11687563   - Many people know of Health Level 7  HL7  as an organization that creates health      care messaging standards  Health Level 7 is also developing standards for the      representation of clinical documents  such as discharge summaries and progress      notes   These document standards make up the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture       CDA   The HL7 CDA Framework, release 1 0, became an ANSI-approved HL7 standard      in November 2000  This article presents the approach and objectives of the CDA,      along with a technical overview of the standard  The CDA is a document markup      standard that specifies the structure and semantics of clinical documents  A CDA       document is a defined and complete information object that can include text,      images, sounds, and other multimedia content  The document can be sent inside an       HL7 message and can exist independently, outside a transferring message  The      first release of the standard has attempted to fill an important gap by      addressing common and largely narrative clinical notes  It deliberately leaves      out certain advanced and complex semantics, both to foster broad implementation      and to give time for these complex semantics to be fleshed out within HL7  Being       a part of the emerging HL7 version 3 family of standards, the CDA derives its      semantic content from the shared HL7 Reference Information Model and is      implemented in Extensible Markup Language  The HL7 mission is to develop      standards that enable semantic interoperability across all platforms  The HL7      version 3 family of standards, including the CDA, are moving us closer to the      realization of this vision

PMID- 11522770   - OBJECTIVES: In the wake of the Institute of Medicine report, To Err Is Human:      Building a Safer Health System  LT Kohn, JM Corrigan, MS Donaldson, eds;      Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1999 , numerous advisory panels are      advocating widespread implementation of physician order entry as a means to      reduce errors and improve patient safety  Successful implementation of an order     entry system requires that attention be given to the user interface  The authors       assessed physician satisfaction with the user interface of two different order     entry systems-a commercially available product, and the Department of Veterans      Affairs Computerized Patient Record System  CPRS   DESIGN AND MEASUREMENT: A      standardized instrument for measuring user satisfaction with physician order     entry systems was mailed to internal medicine and medicine-pediatrics house staff      physicians  The subjects answered questions on each system using a 0 to 9 scale        RESULTS: The survey response rates were 63 and 64 percent for the two order entry      systems  Overall, house staff were dissatisfied with the commercial system,      giving it an overall mean score of 3 67  95 percent confidence interval [95%CI],       3 37-3 97   In contrast, the CPRS had a mean score of 7 21  95% CI, 7 00-7 43 ,      indicating that house staff were satisfied with the system  Overall satisfaction       was most strongly correlated with the ability to perform tasks in a      "straightforward" manner  CONCLUSIONS: User satisfaction differed significantly      between the two order entry systems, suggesting that all order entry systems are       not equally usable  Given the national usage of the two order entry systems      studied, further studies are needed to assess physician satisfaction with use of       these same systems at other institutions

PMID- 11522764   - The Human Brain Project consortium continues to struggle with effective sharing      of tools  To facilitate reuse of its tools, the Stanford Psychiatry Neuroimaging       Laboratory  SPNL  has developed BrainImageJ, a new software framework in Java       The framework consists of two components-a set of four programming interfaces and      an application front end  The four interfaces define extension pathways for new      data models, file loaders and savers, algorithms, and visualization tools  Any      Java class that implements one of these interfaces qualifies as a BrainImageJ      plug-in-a self-contained tool  After automatically detecting and incorporating      new plug-ins, the application front end transparently generates graphical user     interfaces that provide access to plug-in functionality  New plug-ins      interoperate with existing ones immediately through the front end  BrainImageJ is      used at the Stanford Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory to develop image-analysis      algorithms and three-dimensional visualization tools  It is the goal of our     development group that, once the framework is placed in the public domain, it      will serve as an interlaboratory platform for designing, distributing, and using       interoperable tools

PMID- 11522763   - The authors describe the development of a four-dimensional atlas and reference      system that includes both macroscopic and microscopic information on structure      and function of the human brain in persons between the ages of 18 and 90 years       Given the presumed large but previously unquantified degree of structural and      functional variance among normal persons in the human population, the basis for     this atlas and reference system is probabilistic  Through the efforts of the      International Consortium for Brain Mapping  ICBM , 7,000 subjects will be      included in the initial phase of database and atlas development  For each      subject, detailed demographic, clinical, behavioral, and imaging information is      being collected  In addition, 5,800 subjects will contribute DNA for the purpose       of determining genotype- phenotype-behavioral correlations  The process of      developing the strategies, algorithms, data collection methods, validation      approaches, database structures, and distribution of results is described in this      report  Examples of applications of the approach are described for the normal      brain in both adults and children as well as in patients with schizophrenia  This      project should provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic and      macroscopic structure and function in the human brain and should have important      implications in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and cerebral disorders

PMID- 11418546   - OBJECTIVES: Clinical prediction rules have been advocated as a possible mechanism      to enhance clinical judgment in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic      assessment  Despite renewed interest in the their use, inconsistent terminology      makes them difficult to index and retrieve by computerized search systems  No      validated approaches to locating clinical prediction rules appear in the      literature  The objective of this study was to derive and validate an optimal      search filter for retrieving clinical prediction rules, using the National      Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database  DESIGN: A comparative, retrospective      analysis was conducted  The "gold standard" was established by a manual search of      all articles from select print journals for the years 1991 through 1998, which      identified articles covering various aspects of clinical prediction rules such as      derivation, validation, and evaluation  Search filters were derived, from the      articles in the July through December issues of the journals  derivation set , by      analyzing the textwords  words in the title and abstract  and the medical subject      heading  from the MeSH Thesaurus  used to index each article  The accuracy of      these filters in retrieving clinical prediction rules was then assessed using      articles in the January through June issues  validation set   MEASUREMENTS: The      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood      ratio of several different search filters were measured  RESULTS: The filter     "predict$ OR clinical$ OR outcome$ OR risk$" retrieved 98 percent of clinical      prediction rules  Four filters, such as "predict$ OR validat$ OR rule$ OR     predictive value of tests," had both sensitivity and specificity above 90      percent  The top-performing filter for positive predictive value and positive      likelihood ratio in the validation set was "predict$ ti  AND rule$ " CONCLUSIONS:      Several filters with high retrieval value were found  Depending on the goals and       time constraints of the searcher, one of these filters could be used

PMID- 11418544   - OBJECTIVE: To observe how electronic messaging between a hospital consultant and       general practitioners  GPs  in 15 practices about patients suffering from      diabetes evolved over a 3-year period after an initial 1-year study  DESIGN: Case      report  Electronic messages between a hospital consultant and GPs were counted       The authors determined whether a message sent by the consultant was integrated      into the receiving GP's electronic medical record system  After the observation      period, the GPs answered a questionnaire  MEASUREMENTS: The number of electronic       messages and the percentage of messages integrated into the electronic medical      record  RESULTS: The volume of messages was maintained during the 3 years after     the original study  In the original study, the percentage of the messages      integrated by the GPs increased during the year  After that study, however, seven      GPs stopped integrating data from messages  The extent to which received messages      were integrated varied widely among practices  CONCLUSION: The authors conclude      that extrapolation of the results of the original study would have led to      incorrect conclusions  Although the volume of messages remained stable after the       original study, GPs changed their method of handling messages  Initially, all GPs      used the opportunity to copy data from the messages into their own records  At      the end of the observation period  that is, the 3 years after completion of the      original study , more than 50 percent of GPs had ceased copying data from the      messages into their own records  The majority of GPs, however, wanted to expand      the use of electronic messaging

PMID- 11418543   - OBJECTIVE: Direct physician order entry  POE  offers many potential benefits, but      evidence suggests that POE requires substantially more time than traditional      paper-based ordering methods  The Medical Gopher is a well-accepted system for     direct POE that has been in use for more than 15 years  The authors hypothesized       that physicians using the Gopher would not spend any more time writing orders      than physicians using paper-based methods  DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial       of POE using the Medical Gopher system in 11 primary care internal medicine      practices  MEASUREMENTS: The authors collected detailed time use data using time       motion studies of the physicians and surveyed their opinions about the POE      system  RESULTS: The authors found that physicians using the Gopher spent 2 2 min      more per patient overall, but when duplicative and administrative tasks were      taken into account, physicians were found to have spent only 0 43 min more per     patient  With experience, the order entry time fell by 3 73 min per patient  The       survey revealed that the physicians believed that the system improved their     patient care and wanted the Gopher to continue to be available in their     practices  CONCLUSIONS: Little extra time, if any, was required for physicians to      use the POE system  With experience in its use, physicians may even save time      while enjoying the many benefits of POE

PMID- 11418542   - Decision support systems in the medical field have to be easily modified by      medical experts themselves  The authors have designed a knowledge acquisition      tool to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a knowledge base by the domain      expert and its sharing and reuse by other institutions  The Unified Medical      Language System  UMLS  contains the domain entities and constitutes the relations      repository from which the expert builds, through a specific browser, the explicit      domain ontology  The expert is then guided in creating the knowledge base      according to the pre-established domain ontology and condition-action rule      templates that are well adapted to several clinical decision-making processes       Corresponding medical logic modules are eventually generated  The application of       this knowledge acquisition tool to the construction of a decision support system       in blood transfusion demonstrates the value of such a pragmatic methodology for     the design of rule-based clinical systems that rely on the highly progressive      knowledge embedded in hospital information systems

PMID- 11418536   - BACKGROUND: Increasing data suggest that error in medicine is frequent and      results in substantial harm  The recent Institute of Medicine report  LT Kohn, JM      Corrigan, MS Donaldson, eds: To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System       Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1999  described the magnitude of the      problem, and the public interest in this issue, which was already large, has      grown  GOAL: The goal of this white paper is to describe how the frequency and      consequences of errors in medical care can be reduced  although in some instances      they are potentiated  by the use of information technology in the provision of      care, and to make general and specific recommendations regarding error reduction       through the use of information technology  RESULTS: General recommendations are      to implement clinical decision support judiciously; to consider consequent      actions when designing systems; to test existing systems to ensure they actually       catch errors that injure patients; to promote adoption of standards for data and       systems; to develop systems that communicate with each other; to use systems in      new ways; to measure and prevent adverse consequences; to make existing quality      structures meaningful; and to improve regulation and remove disincentives for     vendors to provide clinical decision support  Specific recommendations are to      implement provider order entry systems, especially computerized prescribing; to      implement bar-coding for medications, blood, devices, and patients; and to      utilize modern electronic systems to communicate key pieces of asynchronous data       such as markedly abnormal laboratory values  CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate increases      in the use of information technology in health care- especially the introduction       of clinical decision support and better linkages in and among systems, resulting       in process simplification-could result in substantial improvement in patient      safety

PMID- 11320070   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a computer program to identify adverse drug      events  ADEs  in the ambulatory setting and to evaluate the relative contribution      of four computer search methods for identifying ADEs, including diagnosis codes,       allergy rules, computer event monitoring rules, and text searching  DESIGN:      Retrospective analysis of one year of data from an electronic medical record,      including records for 23,064 patients with a primary care physician, of whom      15,665 actually came for care  MEASUREMENT: Presence of an ADE; sensitivity and      specificity of computer searches for ADE  RESULTS: The computer program      identified 25,056 incidents, which were associated with an estimated 864  95      percent confidence interval [CI], 750-978  ADES  Thus, the ADE rate was 5 5  CI,       5 2-5 9  per 100 patients coming for care  Furthermore, in 79  CI, 68-89  ADEs,      the patient required hospitalization, resulting in an estimated rate of 3 4  CI,       2 7-4 3  admissions per 1,000 patients  The sensitivity of the search methods for     identifying ADEs was estimated to be 58  CI, 18-98  percent, and the estimated      specificity was 88  CI, 87-88  percent  The positive predictive value was 7 5       CI, 6 5-8 5  percent, and the negative predictive value was 99 2  CI,      95 5-99 98  percent  Compared with age and gender-matched controls with no      positive screen, patients with ADEs had twice as many outpatient visits and were       taking nearly three times as many drugs  Antihypertensives, ACE-inhibitors,      antibiotics, and diuretics were associated with 56  CI, 47-65  percent of ADES       Among ADEs, 23  CI, 16-32  percent were life-threatening or serious, and 38  CI,       29-47  percent were judged preventable  CONCLUSION: Computerized search programs       can detect ADEs, and free-text searches were especially useful  Adverse drug      events were frequent, and admissions were not rare, although most hospitals today      do not identify them  Thus, such detection programs demonstrate "value-added" for     the electronic record and may be useful for directing and assessing the impact of      quality improvement efforts

PMID- 11320069   - Prefetching methods have traditionally been used to restore archived images from       picture archiving and communication systems to diagnostic imaging workstations      prior to anticipated need, facilitating timely comparison of historical studies      and patient management  The authors describe a problem-oriented prefetching      scheme, detailing 1  a mechanism supporting selection of patients for prefetching      via characterizations of clinical problems, using multiple data sources  picture       archiving and communication systems, hospital information systems, and radiology       information systems , classifying patients into cohorts on the basis of their     medical conditions  e g , lung cancer ; and 2  prefetching of multimedia data       imaging, laboratory, and medical reports  from clinical databases to enable the       viewing of an integrated patient record  Preliminary evaluation of the      prefetching algorithm using classic information retrieval measures showed that      the system had high recall  100 percent , correctly identifying and retrieving      data for all patients belonging to a target cohort, but low precision  50      percent   A key finding during testing was that the recall of the system was      increased through the use of multiple data sources  compared with one data      source , because of better patient descriptors  Medical problems and patient      cohorts were more specifically defined by combining information from      heterogeneous databases

PMID- 11320066   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is twofold: 1  to explore the applicability      of combinatorial terminologies as the basis for building enumerated      classifications, and 2  to investigate the usefulness of formal terminological      systems for performing such classification and for assisting in the refinement of      both combinatorial terminologies and enumerated classifications  DESIGN: A formal      model of the beta version of the International Classification for Nursing      Practice  ICNP  was constructed in the compositional terminological language      GRAIL  GALEN Representation and Integration Language   Terms drawn from the North      American Nursing Diagnosis Association Taxonomy I  NANDA taxonomy  were mapped      into the model and classified automatically using GALEN technology  MEASUREMENTS:      The resulting generated hierarchy was compared with the NANDA taxonomy to assess       coverage and accuracy of classification  RESULTS: In terms of coverage, in this      study ICNP was able to capture 77 percent of NANDA terms using concepts drawn      from five of its eight axes  Three axes-Body Site, Topology, and Frequency-were      not needed  In terms of accuracy, where hierarchic relationships existed in the      generated hierarchy or the NANDA taxonomy, or both, 6 were identical, 19 existed       in the generated hierarchy alone  2 of these were considered suitable for     incorporation into the NANDA taxonomy and 17 were considered inaccurate , and 23       appeared in the NANDA taxonomy alone  8 of these were considered suitable for     incorporation into ICNP, 9 were considered inaccurate, and 6 reflected different,      equally valid perspectives   Sixty terms appeared at the top level, with no      indenting, in both the generated hierarchy and the NANDA taxonomy  CONCLUSIONS:      With appropriate refinement, combinatorial terminologies such as ICNP have the      potential to provide a useful foundation for representing enumerated      classifications such as NANDA  Technologies such as GALEN make possible the      process of building automatically enumerated classifications while providing a      useful means of validating and refining both combinatorial terminologies and      enumerated classifications

PMID- 11320065   - Current nursing terminology efforts have converged toward meeting the demand for       a reference terminology for nursing concepts by building on the foundation of      existing interface and administrative terminologies and by collaborating with      terminology efforts across the spectrum of health care  In this article, the      authors illustrate how collaboration is promoting convergence toward a reference       terminology for nursing by briefly summarizing a wide range of exemplary      activities  These include: 1  the International Classification of Nursing      Practice  ICNP  activities of the International Council of Nurses  ICN , 2  work       in Brazil and Korea that has contributed to, and been stimulated by, ICNP      developments, 3  efforts in the United States to improve understanding of the      different types of terminologies needed in nursing and to promote harmonization      and linking among them, and 4  current nursing participation in major     multi-disciplinary standards initiatives  Although early nursing terminology work      occurred primarily in isolation and resulted in some duplicative efforts, the      activities summarized in this article demonstrate a tremendous level of      collaboration and convergence not only in the discipline of nursing but in      multi-disciplinary standards initiatives  These efforts are an important      prerequisite for ensuring that nursing concepts are represented in computer-based      systems in a manner that facilitates multi-purpose use at local, national,      regional, and international levels

PMID- 11320064   - The contention of the author is that an informatics infrastructure is essential      for evidenced-based practice  Five building blocks of an informatics      infrastructure for evidence-based practice are proposed: 1  standardized      terminologies and structures, 2  digital sources of evidence, 3  standards that      facilitate health care data exchange among heterogeneous systems, 4  informatics       processes that support the acquisition and application of evidence to a specific       clinical situation, and 5  informatics competencies  Selected examples illustrate      how each of these building blocks supports the application of evidence to      practice and the building of evidence from practice  Although a number of major     challenges remain, medical informatics can provide solutions that have the      potential to decrease unintended variation in practice and health care errors

PMID- 11230385   - OBJECTIVE: To examine the type of information obtainable from scientific papers,       using three different methods for the extraction, organization, and preparation      of literature reviews  DESIGN: A set of three review papers was identified, and      the ideas represented by the authors of those papers were extracted  The 161      articles referenced in those three reviews were then analyzed using 1  a      formalized data extraction approach, which uses a protocol-driven manual process       to extract the variables, values, and statistical significance of the stated      relationships; and 2  a computerized approach known as "Idea Analysis," which      uses the abstracts of the original articles and processes them through a computer     software program that reads the abstracts and organizes the ideas presented by      the authors  The results were then compared  The literature focused on the human       papillomavirus and its relationship to cervical cancer  RESULTS: Idea Analysis      was able to identify 68 9 percent of the ideas considered by the authors of the      three review papers to be of importance in describing the association between      human papillomavirus and cervical cancer  The formalized data extraction      identified 27 percent of the authors' ideas  The combination of the two      approaches identified 74 3 percent of the ideas considered important in the      relationship between human papillomavirus and cervical cancer, as reported by the      authors of the three review articles  CONCLUSION: This research demonstrated that      both a technically derived and a computer derived collection, categorization, and      summarization of original articles and abstracts could provide a reliable, valid,      and reproducible source of ideas duplicating, to a major degree, the ideas      presented by subject specialists in review articles  As such, these tools may be       useful to experts preparing literature reviews by eliminating many of the      clerical-mechanical features associated with present-day scientific text      processing

PMID- 11230383   - OBJECTIVE: The development of tailor-made domain-specific modeling languages is      sometimes desirable in medical informatics  Naturally, the development of such      languages should be guided  The purpose of this article is to introduce a set of       requirements for such languages and show their application in analyzing and      comparing existing modeling languages  DESIGN: The requirements arise from the      practical experience of the authors and others in the development of modeling      languages in both general informatics and medical informatics  The requirements      initially emerged from the analysis of information modeling techniques  The      requirements are designed to be orthogonal, i e , one requirement can be violated      without violation of the others  RESULTS: The proposed requirements for any      modeling language are that it be "formal" with regard to syntax and semantics,      "conceptual," "expressive," "comprehensible," "suitable," and "executable " The      requirements are illustrated using both the medical logic modules of the Arden      Syntax as a running example and selected examples from other modeling languages        CONCLUSION: Activity diagrams of the Unified Modeling Language, task structures      for work flows, and Petri nets are discussed with regard to the list of      requirements, and various tradeoffs are thus made explicit  It is concluded that       this set of requirements has the potential to play a vital role in both the      evaluation of existing domain-specific languages and the development of new ones

PMID- 11230382   - The paper describes T/Gen, a prototype computer-based tool designed to help      maintain the knowledge in a computer-based clinical practice guideline that      provides patient-specific recommendations  T/Gen takes as input a set of clinical      conditions to which a guideline must react, and allows the user to specify      domain-specific constraints as to which combinations of conditions do not make      sense or do not need to be exhaustively tested against one another  T/Gen      automatically generates constrained sets of combinations of clinical conditions,       each corresponding to a clinical case  or to several closely related clinical      cases  that can be used to help test the computer-based guideline  The      combinations can be used to test the guideline logic using T/Gen's built-in logic      interpreter, or to generate a set of test cases for use in testing an operational      guideline system  T/Gen has been developed and tested with five pilot guidelines,      for two childhood immunization series, for influenza vaccination, for primary      thyroid screening, and for embryo transplantation  The paper describes how      T/Gen's approach is implemented for the five pilot guidelines, outlines the      current status and future directions of the project, and discusses the design      issues that arose in the course of carrying out the work

PMID- 11141515   - OBJECTIVE: Classifications of diagnoses and procedures are very important for the      economical as well as the quality assessment of surgical departments  They should      reflect the morbidity of the patients treated and the work done  The authors      investigated the fulfillment of these requirements by ICD-9  International      Classification of Diseases: 9th Revision  and OPS-301, a German adaptation of the      ICPM  International Classification of Procedures in Medicine , in clinical      practice  DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted using the data warehouse of      the Surgical Center II at the Medical Faculty in Essen, Germany  The sample      included 28,293 operations from the departments of general surgery, neurosurgery,      and trauma surgery  Distribution of cases per ICD-9 and OPS-301 codes,      aggregation through the digits of the codes, and concordance between the      classifications were used as measurements  Median and range were calculated as      distribution parameters  The concentration of cases per code was graphed using      Lorenz curves  The most frequent codes of diagnoses were compared with the most      frequent codes of surgical procedures concerning their medical information       RESULTS: The total number of codes used from ICD-9 and OPS-301 went up to 14      percent, depending on the surgical field  The median number of cases per code was      between 2 and 4  The concentration of codes was enormous: 10 percent of the codes      were used for about 70 percent of the surgical procedures  The distribution after     an aggregation by digit was better with OPS-301 than with ICD-9  The views with      OPS-301 and ICD-9 were quite different  CONCLUSION: Statistics based on ICD-9 or       OPS-301 will not properly reflect the morbidity in different surgical      departments  Neither classification adequately represents the work done by      surgical staff  This is because of an uneven granularity in the classifications        The results demand a replacement of the ICD-9 by an improved terminological      system in surgery  The OPS-301 should be maintained and can be used at least in      the medium term

PMID- 11141514   - OBJECTIVES: To explore the feasibility of using the National Library of      Medicine's Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  Metathesaurus as the basis for       a computational strategy to identify concepts in medical narrative text      preparatory to indexing  To quantitatively evaluate this strategy in terms of      true positives, false positives  spuriously identified concepts  and false      negatives  concepts missed by the identification process   METHODS: Using the      1999 UMLS Metathesaurus, the authors processed a training set of 100 documents       50 discharge summaries, 50 surgical notes  with a concept-identification      program, whose output was manually analyzed  They flagged concepts that were      erroneously identified and added new concepts that were not identified by the      program, recording the reason for failure in such cases  After several      refinements to both their algorithm and the UMLS subset on which it operated,      they deployed the program on a test set of 24 documents  12 of each kind        RESULTS: Of 8,745 matches in the training set, 7,227  82 6 percent   were true      positives, whereas of 1,701 matches in the test set, 1, 298  76 3 percent  were      true positives  Matches other than true positive indicated potential problems in       production-mode concept indexing  Examples of causes of problems were redundant      concepts in the UMLS, homonyms, acronyms, abbreviations and elisions, concepts      that were missing from the UMLS, proper names, and spelling errors  CONCLUSIONS:       The error rate was too high for concept indexing to be the only production-mode      means of preprocessing medical narrative  Considerable curation needs to be      performed to define a UMLS subset that is suitable for concept matching

PMID- 11141513   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence of the effectiveness of computer-generated health      behavior interventions-clinical encounters "in absentia"-as extensions of      face-to-face patient care in an ambulatory setting  DATA SOURCES: Systematic      electronic database and manual searches of multiple sources  1996-1999  plus      search for gray literature were conducted to identify clinical trials using      computer-generated health behavior interventions to motivate individuals to adopt      treatment regimens, focusing on patient-interactive interventions and use of      health behavior models  STUDY SELECTION: Eligibility criteria included randomized      controlled studies with some evidence of instrument reliability and validity; use      of at least one patient-interactive targeted or tailored feedback, reminder, or     educational intervention intended to influence or improve a stated health      behavior; and an association between one intervention variable and a health      behavior  DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were described by delivery device  print,      automated telephone, computer, and mobile communication  and intervention type       personalized, targeted, and tailored   We employed qualitative methods to      analyze the retrieval set and explore the issue of patient interactive      computer-generated behavioral intervention systems  DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies      varied widely in methodology, quality, subject number, and characteristics,      measurement of effects and health behavior focus  Of 37 eligible trials, 34  91 9      percent  reported either statistically significant or improved outcomes  Fourteen      studies used targeted interventions; 23 used tailored  Of the 14 targeted      intervention studies, 13  92 9 percent  reported improved outcomes  Of the 23      tailored intervention studies, 21  91 3 percent  reported improved outcomes       CONCLUSIONS: The literature indicates that computer-generated health behavior     interventions are effective  While there is evidence that tailored interventions       can more positively affect health behavior change than can targeted, personalized      or generic interventions, there is little research comparing different tailoring       protocols with one another  Only those studies using print and telephone devices       reported a theoretic basis for their methodology  Future studies need to identify      which models are best suited to which health behavior, whether certain delivery      devices are more appropriate for different health behaviors, and how ambulatory      care can benefit from patients' use of portable devices

PMID- 11141510   - OBJECTIVE: Generalizing the data models underlying two prototype neurophysiology       databases, the authors describe and propose the Common Data Model  CDM  as a      framework for federating a broad spectrum of disparate neuroscience information      resources  DESIGN: Each component of the CDM derives from one of five      superclasses-data, site, method, model, and reference-or from relations defined      between them  A hierarchic attribute-value scheme for metadata enables      interoperability with variable tree depth to serve specific intra- or broad      inter-domain queries  To mediate data exchange between disparate systems, the      authors propose a set of XML-derived schema for describing not only data sets but      data models  These include biophysical description markup language  BDML , which       mediates interoperability between data resources by providing a meta-description       for the CDM  RESULTS: The set of superclasses potentially spans data needs of      contemporary neuroscience  Data elements abstracted from neurophysiology time      series and histogram data represent data sets that differ in dimension and      concordance  Site elements transcend neurons to describe subcellular     compartments, circuits, regions, or slices; non-neuroanatomic sites include      sequences to patients  Methods and models are highly domain-dependent       CONCLUSIONS: True federation of data resources requires explicit public      description, in a metalanguage, of the contents, query methods, data formats, and      data models of each data resource  Any data model that can be derived from the      defined superclasses is potentially conformant and interoperability can be      enabled by recognition of BDML-described compatibilities  Such metadescriptions      can buffer technologic changes

PMID- 11141509   - OBJECTIVE: Analysis of brain ultrastructure is needed to reveal how neurons      communicate with one another via synapses and how disease processes alter this      communication  In the past, such analyses have usually been based on single or     paired sections obtained by electron microscopy  Reconstruction from multiple      serial sections provides a much needed, richer representation of the      three-dimensional organization of the brain  This paper introduces a new      reconstruction system and new methods for analyzing in three dimensions the      location and ultrastructure of neuronal components, such as synapses, which are      distributed non-randomly throughout the brain  DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Volumes      are reconstructed by defining transformations that align the entire area of      adjacent sections  Whole-field alignment requires rotation, translation, skew,      scaling, and second-order nonlinear deformations  Such transformations are      implemented by a linear combination of bivariate polynomials  Computer software      for generating transformations based on user input is described  Stereological      techniques for assessing structural distributions in reconstructed volumes are      the unbiased bricking, disector, unbiased ratio, and per-length counting      techniques  A new general method, the fractional counter, is also described  This      unbiased technique relies on the counting of fractions of objects contained in a       test volume  A volume of brain tissue from stratum radiatum of hippocampal area      CA1 is reconstructed and analyzed for synaptic density to demonstrate and compare      the techniques  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction makes practicable      volume-oriented analysis of ultrastructure using such techniques as the unbiased       bricking and fractional counter methods  These analysis methods are less      sensitive to the section-to-section variations in counts and section thickness,      factors that contribute to the inaccuracy of other stereological methods  In      addition, volume reconstruction facilitates visualization and modeling of      structures and analysis of three-dimensional relationships such as synaptic      connectivity

PMID- 11062234   - OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine whether dynamic categorization, a      new technique for organizing search results, is more useful than the two existing      organizational techniques: relevance ranking and clustering  They define a useful      tool as one that helps users learn about the kinds of information that pertain to      their query, find answers to their questions efficiently and easily, and feel      satisfied with their search experience  DESIGN: Fifteen patients with breast      cancer and their family members completed query-related tasks using all three      tools  The authors measured the time it took the subjects to accomplish their     tasks, the number of answers to the query that the subjects found in four     minutes, and the number of new answers that they could recall at the end of the      study  Subjects also completed a user-satisfaction questionnaire  RESULTS: The      results showed that patients with breast cancer and their family members could      find significantly  P: < 0 05  more answers in a fixed amount of time and were      significantly  P: < 0 05  more satisfied with their search experience when they      used the dynamic categorization tool than when they used either the cluster tool       or the ranking tool  Subjects indicated that the dynamic categorization tool      provided an organization of search results that was more clear, easy to use,      accurate, precise, and helpful than those of the other tools  CONCLUSION: The      experiments indicate that dynamic categorization is an effective and useful      approach for organizing search results  Tools that use this technique will help      patients and their families gain quick and easy access to important medical      information

PMID- 11062233   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a natural language processing system in      extracting pneumonia-related concepts from chest x-ray reports  METHODS: DESIGN:       Four physicians, three lay persons, a natural language processing system, and two      keyword searches  designated AAKS and KS  detected the presence or absence of      three pneumonia-related concepts and inferred the presence or absence of acute      bacterial pneumonia from 292 chest x-ray reports  Gold standard: Majority vote of      three independent physicians  Reliability of the gold standard was measured       Outcome measures: Recall, precision, specificity, and agreement  using Finn's R:       statistic  with respect to the gold standard  Differences between the physicians       and the other subjects were tested using the McNemar test for each pneumonia      concept and for the disease inference of acute bacterial pneumonia  RESULTS:      Reliability of the reference standard ranged from 0 86 to 0 96  Recall,      precision, specificity, and agreement  Finn R:  for the inference on acute      bacterial pneumonia were, respectively, 0 94, 0 87, 0 91, and 0 84 for     physicians; 0 95, 0 78, 0 85, and 0 75 for natural language processing system;      0 46, 0 89, 0 95, and 0 54 for lay persons; 0 79, 0 63, 0 71, and 0 49 for AAKS;       and 0 87, 0 70, 0 77, and 0 62 for KS  The McNemar pairwise comparisons showed      differences between one physician and the natural language processing system for       the infiltrate concept and between another physician and the natural language      processing system for the inference on acute bacterial pneumonia  The comparisons      also showed that most physicians were significantly different from the other     subjects in all pneumonia concepts and the disease inference  CONCLUSION: In      extracting pneumonia related concepts from chest x-ray reports, the performance      of the natural language processing system was similar to that of physicians and      better than that of lay persons and keyword searches  The encoded pneumonia      information has the potential to support several pneumonia-related applications      used in our institution  The applications include a decision support system      called the antibiotic assistant, a computerized clinical protocol for pneumonia,       and a quality assurance application in the radiology department

PMID- 11062232   - OBJECTIVE: To create "extensional definitions" of laboratory codes from derived      characteristics of coded values in a clinical database and then use these      definitions in the automated mapping of codes between disparate facilities       DESIGN: Repository data for two laboratory facilities in the Intermountain Health      Care system were analyzed to create extensional definitions for the local codes      of each facility  These definitions were then matched using automated matching      software to create mappings between the shared local codes  The results were      compared with the mappings of the vocabulary developers  MEASUREMENTS: The number     of correct matches and the size of the match group were recorded  A match was      considered correct if the corresponding codes from each facility were included in      the group  The group size was defined as the total number of codes in the match      group  e g , a one-to-one mapping is a group size of two   RESULTS: Of the      matches generated by the automated matching software, 81 percent were correct       The average group size was 2 4  There were a total of 328 possible matches in the      data set, and 75 percent of these were correctly identified  CONCLUSIONS:      Extensional definitions for local codes created from repository data can be      utilized to automatically map codes from disparate systems  This approach, if      generalized to other systems, can reduce the effort required to map one system to      another while increasing mapping consistency

PMID- 11062231   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a computer-based patient record system on      human cognition  Computer-based patient record systems can be considered      "cognitive artifacts," which shape the way in which health care workers obtain,      organize, and reason with knowledge  DESIGN: Study 1 compared physicians'      organization of clinical information in paper-based and computer-based patient      records in a diabetes clinic  Study 2 extended the first study to include      analysis of doctor-patient-computer interactions, which were recorded on video in      their entirety  In Study 3, physicians' interactions with computer-based records       were followed through interviews and automatic logging of cases entered in the      computer-based patient record  RESULTS: Results indicate that exposure to the      computer-based patient record was associated with changes in physicians'      information gathering and reasoning strategies  Differences were found in the      content and organization of information, with paper records having a narrative      structure, while the computer-based records were organized into discrete items of      information  The differences in knowledge organization had an effect on data      gathering strategies, where the nature of doctor-patient dialogue was influenced       by the structure of the computer-based patient record system  CONCLUSION:      Technology has a profound influence in shaping cognitive behavior, and the      potential effects of cognition on technology design needs to be explored

PMID- 11062230   - The development of integrated health care systems, the building of distributed      computer networks throughout them, and the advent of easy-to-use electronic      medical records for ambulatory practices combine to create a powerful argument      for an enterprise electronic medical record  Potential customers need to learn      from both successes and failures  Although the author could find in the      literature only two reports of failures, a survey of family practice residencies       revealed ten programs in which use of an electronic medical record had been      discontinued  The author reports on a project that was terminated even though the      technology was adequate to achieve the original project goals

PMID- 11062227   - Nursing Vocabulary Summit participants were challenged to consider whether     reference terminology and information models might be a way to move toward better     capture of data in electronic medical records  A requirement of such reference      models is fidelity to representations of domain knowledge  This article discusses      embedded structures in three different approaches to organizing domain knowledge:      scientific reasoning, expertise, and standardized nursing languages  The concept       of pressure ulcer is presented as an example of the various ways lexical elements      used in relation to a specific concept are organized across systems  Different      approaches to structuring information-the clinical information system, minimum      data sets, and standardized messaging formats-are similarly discussed       Recommendations include identification of the polyhierarchies and categorical      structures required within a reference terminology, systematic evaluations of the      extent to which structured information accurately and completely represents      domain knowledge, and modifications or extensions to existing multidisciplinary      efforts

PMID- 11062225   - Terminology work in nursing has given rise to an increasing number of nursing      terminologies  These generally take the form of controlled vocabularies  Because       of the limitations of the controlled vocabulary approach, individual      terminologies tend to be tuned to meet the specific needs of their intended      users  Differences between terminologies are now a significant barrier to the      comparison and interchange of health information  To agree on a single,      multipurpose terminology would be problematic  However, several options for     resolving unnecessary differences between nursing terminologies are currently      being explored by international standards bodies and other groups, such as the      U S  Nursing Vocabulary Summit  One such option is the use of a terminology model      to facilitate evolution toward a more coherent range of terminologies  The      authors describe the motivation behind the development of a standard for nursing       terminologies  They explain how a terminology model might form the basis for such      a standard through a description of the approach taken by CEN TC251  the Health      Informatics Technical Committee of the European Committee for Standardization        They also discuss possible limitations of standardization

PMID- 11062224   - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the 1999 Nursing Vocabulary Summit Conference was to       seek consensus on and a common approach to the development of nursing terminology      standards for use in information systems  METHODS: A four-day invitational      conference brought together authors and representatives of responsible      organizations concerned with the nursing terminologies recognized or under     consideration by the American Nurses Association, along with experts on language       and standards and representatives of professional organizations, federal      agencies, and the health informatics industry  RESULTS: Participants      distinguished between colloquial terminologies and reference terminologies, and      between information models and terminology models  They agreed that most      recognized nursing terminologies were colloquial terminologies and that a      reference terminology was needed  They formed task forces to develop and test      aspects of a reference terminology model prior to a second meeting in June 2000,       at which they would determine readiness to collaborate on a single international       standard  DISCUSSION: The 1999 Nursing Vocabulary Summit Conference changed the      level of discussion about nursing vocabulary standards from a debate about the      relative merits of the various terminologies recognized in the United States to      an examination of methods for developing and testing a reference terminology      model and, eventually, a reference terminology that could serve as an      international standard

PMID- 10984469   - PURPOSE: The authors study the extraction of useful phrases from a natural      language database by statistical methods  The aim is to leverage human effort by       providing preprocessed phrase lists with a high percentage of useful material       METHOD: The approach is to develop six different scoring methods that are based      on different aspects of phrase occurrence  The emphasis here is not on lexical      information or syntactic structure but rather on the statistical properties of      word pairs and triples that can be obtained from a large database  MEASUREMENTS:       The Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  incorporates a large list of humanly      acceptable phrases in the medical field as a part of its structure  The authors      use this list of phrases as a gold standard for validating their methods  A good       method is one that ranks the UMLS phrases high among all phrases studied       Measurements are 11-point average precision values and precision-recall curves      based on the rankings  RESULT: The authors find of six different scoring methods       that each proves effective in identifying UMLS quality phrases in a large subset       of MEDLINE  These methods are applicable both to word pairs and word triples  All      six methods are optimally combined to produce composite scoring methods that are       more effective than any single method  The quality of the composite methods      appears sufficient to support the automatic placement of hyperlinks in text at      the site of highly ranked phrases  CONCLUSION: Statistical scoring methods      provide a promising approach to the extraction of useful phrases from a natural      language database for the purpose of indexing or providing hyperlinks in text

PMID- 10984468   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a guideline document model that includes a sufficiently      broad set of concepts to be useful throughout the guideline life cycle  DESIGN:      Current guideline document models are limited in that they reflect the specific      orientation of the stakeholder who created them; thus, developers and      disseminators often provide few constructs for conceptualizing recommendations,      while implementers de-emphasize concepts related to establishing guideline      validity  The authors developed the Guideline Elements Model  GEM  using XML to      better represent the heterogeneous knowledge contained in practice guidelines       Core constructs were derived from the Institute of Medicine's Guideline Appraisal      Instrument, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the augmented decision      table guideline representation  These were supplemented by additional concepts      from a literature review  RESULTS: The GEM hierarchy includes more than 100      elements  Major concepts relate to a guideline's identity, developer, purpose,      intended audience, method of development, target population, knowledge      components, testing, and review plan  Knowledge components in guideline documents      include recommendations  which in turn comprise conditionals and imperatives ,      definitions, and algorithms  CONCLUSION: GEM is more comprehensive than existing       models and is expressively adequate to represent the heterogeneous information      contained in guidelines  Use of XML contributes to a flexible, comprehensible,      shareable, and reusable knowledge representation that is both readable by human      beings and processible by computers

PMID- 10984467   - BACKGROUND: The entity-attribute-value representation with classes and      relationships  EAV/CR  provides a flexible and simple database schema to store      heterogeneous biomedical data  In certain circumstances, however, the EAV/CR     model is known to retrieve data less efficiently than conventionally based      database schemas  OBJECTIVE: To perform a pilot study that systematically      quantifies performance differences for database queries directed at real-world      microbiology data modeled with EAV/CR and conventional representations, and to      explore the relative merits of different EAV/CR query implementation strategies        METHODS: Clinical microbiology data obtained over a ten-year period were stored      using both database models  Query execution times were compared for four     clinically oriented attribute-centered and entity-centered queries operating      under varying conditions of database size and system memory  The performance      characteristics of three different EAV/CR query strategies were also examined       RESULTS: Performance was similar for entity-centered queries in the two database       models  Performance in the EAV/CR model was approximately three to five times      less efficient than its conventional counterpart for attribute-centered queries        The differences in query efficiency became slightly greater as database size      increased, although they were reduced with the addition of system memory  The      authors found that EAV/CR queries formulated using multiple, simple SQL      statements executed in batch were more efficient than single, large SQL      statements  CONCLUSION: This paper describes a pilot project to explore issues in      and compare query performance for EAV/CR and conventional database      representations  Although attribute-centered queries were less efficient in the      EAV/CR model, these inefficiencies may be addressable, at least in part, by the      use of more powerful hardware or more memory, or both

PMID- 10984464   - Recent research has studied the communication behaviors of clinical hospital      workers and observed a tendency for these workers to use communication behaviors       that were often inefficient  Workers were observed to favor synchronous forms of       communication, such as telephone calls and chance face-to-face meetings with      colleagues, even when these channels were not effective  Synchronous      communication also contributes to a highly interruptive working environment,      increasing the potential for clinical errors to be made  This paper reviews these      findings from a cognitive psychological perspective, focusing on current      understandings of how human memory functions and on the potential consequences of      interruptions on the ability to work effectively  It concludes by discussing      possible communication technology interventions that could be introduced to      improve the clinical communication environment and suggests directions for future      research

PMID- 10984463   - Linking the electronic health record to the digital library is a Web-era      reformulation of the long-standing informatics goal of seamless integration of      automated clinical data and relevant knowledge-based information to support      informed decisions  The spread of the Internet, the development of the World Wide      Web, and converging format standards for electronic health data and digital      publications make effective linking increasingly feasible  Some existing systems       link electronic health data and knowledge-based information in limited settings      or limited ways  Yet many challenging informatics research problems remain to be       solved before flexible and seamless linking becomes a reality and before systems       become capable of delivering the specific piece of information needed at the time      and place a decision must be made  Connecting the electronic health record to the      digital library also requires positive resolution of important policy issues,      including health data privacy, government encouragement of high-speed      communications, electronic intellectual property rights, and standards for health      data and for digital libraries  Both the research problems and the policy issues       should be important priorities for the field of medical informatics

PMID- 10984462   - For the past decade, Stanford Medical Informatics has combined clinical      informatics and bioinformatics research and training in an explicit way  The      interest in applying informatics techniques to both clinical problems and      problems in basic science can be traced to the Dendral project in the 1960s       Having bioinformatics and clinical informatics in the same academic unit is still      somewhat unusual and can lead to clashes of clinical and basic science cultures        Nevertheless, the benefits of this organization have recently become clear, as      the landscape of academic medicine in the next decades has begun to emerge  The      author provides examples of technology transfer between clinical informatics and       bioinformatics that illustrate how they complement each other

PMID- 10984461   - This paper provides a "viewpoint discussion" based on a presentation made to the       2000 Symposium of the American College of Medical Informatics  It discusses      potential opportunities for researchers in health informatics to become involved       in the rapidly growing field of bioinformatics, using the activities of the Yale       Center for Medical Informatics as a case study  One set of opportunities occurs      where bioinformatics research itself intersects with the clinical world  Examples      include the correlations between individual genetic variation with clinical risk       factors, disease presentation, and differential response to treatment; and the      implications of including genetic test results in the patient record, which      raises clinical decision support issues as well as legal and ethical issues  A      second set of opportunities occurs where bioinformatics research can benefit from      the technologic expertise and approaches that informaticians have used      extensively in the clinical arena  Examples include database organization and      knowledge representation, data mining, and modeling and simulation  Microarray      technology is discussed as a specific potential area for collaboration  Related      questions concern how best to establish collaborations with bioscientists so that      the interests and needs of both sets of researchers can be met in a synergistic      fashion, and the most appropriate home for bioinformatics in an academic medical       center

PMID- 10887168   - OBJECTIVE: Currently, when cytopathology images are archived, they are typically       stored with a limited text-based description of their content  Such a description      inherently fails to quantify the properties of an image and refers to an      extremely small fraction of its information content  This paper describes a      method for automatically indexing images of individual cells and their associated      diagnoses by computationally derived cell descriptors  This methodology may serve      to better index data contained in digital image databases, thereby enabling      cytologists and pathologists to cross-reference cells of unknown etiology or     nature  DESIGN: The indexing method, implemented in a program called PathMaster,       uses a series of computer-based feature extraction routines  Descriptors of      individual cell characteristics generated by these routines are employed as      indexes of cell morphology, texture, color, and spatial orientation       MEASUREMENTS: The indexing fidelity of the program was tested after populating      its database with images of 152 lymphocytes/lymphoma cells captured from lymph      node touch preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin  Images of "unknown"      lymphoid cells, previously unprocessed, were then submitted for feature      extraction and diagnostic cross-referencing analysis  RESULTS: PathMaster listed       the correct diagnosis as its first differential in 94 percent of recognition      trials  In the remaining 6 percent of trials, PathMaster listed the correct      diagnosis within the first three "differentials " CONCLUSION: PathMaster is a      pilot cell image indexing program/search engine that creates an indexed reference      of images  Use of such a reference may provide assistance in the      diagnostic/prognostic process by furnishing a prioritized list of possible      identifications for a cell of uncertain etiology

PMID- 10887167   - OBJECTIVES: To measure the strength of agreement between the concepts and records      retrieved from a computerized patient database, in response to physician-derived       questions, using a semantic terminological model for clinical findings with those      concepts and records excerpted clinically by manual identification  The      performance of the semantic terminological model is also compared with the more      established retrieval methods of free-text search, ICD-10, and hierarchic      retrieval  DESIGN: A clinical database  Diabeta  of 106,000 patient problem      record entries containing 2,625 unique concepts in an clinical academic      department was used to compare semantic, free-text, ICD-10, and hierarchic data      retrieval against a gold standard in response to a battery of 47 clinical      questions  MEASUREMENTS: The performance of concept and record retrieval      expressed as mean detection rate, positive predictive value, Yates corrected and       Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared values, and Cohen kappa value, with significance      estimated using the Mann-Whitney test  RESULTS: The semantic terminological model      used to retrieve clinically useful concepts from a patient database performed      well and better than other methods, with a mean detection rate of 0 86, a      positive predictive value of 0 96, a Yates corrected chi-squared value of 1,537,       a Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared value of 19,302, and a Cohen kappa of 0 88  Results      for record retrieval were even better, with a mean record detection rate of 0 94,      a positive predictive value of 0 99, a Yates corrected chi-squared value of 94,      774, a Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared value of 1,550,356, and a Cohen kappa value of      0 94  The mean detection rate, Yates corrected chi-squared value, and Cohen kappa      value for semantic retrieval were significantly better than for the other     methods  CONCLUSION: The use of a semantic terminological model in this test      scenario provides an effective framework for representing clinical finding      concepts and their relationships  Although currently incomplete, the model      supports improved information retrieval from a patient database in response to      clinically relevant questions, when compared with alternative methods of      analysis

PMID- 10887164   - Integrating data that reside in different systems remains an often laborious      process, requiring either manual steps or complicated programming  This paper     describes a method for state-mandated reporting of childhood blood lead testing      results that makes use of object linking and embedding technology and readily      available software products to pull together information from different legacy      systems  A terminal session emulator employs object linking and embedding      automation to extract host data, and Visual Basic routines specify the user     interface and database manipulation  This system has significantly increased the       efficiency and accuracy with which blood lead testing reports are provided to the      local state health department  The system provides a model for a relatively easy       solution for laboratories and other groups that need a way to integrate standard       data sets that are distributed across legacy systems

PMID- 10833168   - The 1999 debate of the American College of Medical Informatics focused on the      proposition that medical informatics and nursing informatics are distinctive      disciplines that require their own core curricula, training programs, and      professional identities  Proponents of this position emphasized that informatics       training, technology applications, and professional identities are closely tied      to the activities of the health professionals they serve and that, as nursing and      medicine differ, so do the corresponding efforts in information science and      technology  Opponents of the proposition asserted that informatics is built on a       re-usable and widely applicable set of methods that are common to all health      science disciplines, and that "medical informatics" continues to be a useful name      for a composite core discipline that should be studied by all students,      regardless of their health profession orientation

PMID- 10833167   - The evolution of health terminology has undergone glacial transition over time,      although this pace has quickened recently  After a long history of near neglect,       unimaginative structure, and factitious development, health terminologies are in       an era of unprecedented importance, sophistication, and collaboration  The major       highlights of this history are reviewed, together with important intellectual      advances in health terminology development  The inescapable conclusion is that we      are amidst a major revolution in the role and capabilities of health      terminologies, entering an age of large-scale systems for health concept      representation with international implications

PMID- 10833166   - Knowledge representation involves enumeration of conceptual symbols and      arrangement of these symbols into some meaningful structure  Medical knowledge      representation has traditionally focused more on the structure than the symbols        Several significant efforts are under way, at local, national, and international       levels, to address the representation of the symbols though the creation of      high-quality terminologies that are themselves knowledge based  This paper     reviews these efforts, including the Medical Entities Dictionary  MED  in use at       Columbia University and the New York Presbyterian Hospital  A decade's experience      with the MED is summarized to serve as a proof-of-concept that knowledge-based      terminologies can support the use of coded patient data for a variety of      knowledge-based activities, including the improved understanding of patient data,      the access of information sources relevant to specific patient care problems, the      application of expert systems directly to the care of patients, and the discovery      of new medical knowledge  The terminological knowledge in the MED has also been      used successfully to support clinical application development and maintenance,      including that of the MED itself  On the basis of this experience, current      efforts to create standard knowledge-based terminologies appear to be justified

PMID- 10833164   - While largely ignored in informatics thinking, the clinical communication space      accounts for the major part of the information flow in health care  Growing      evidence indicates that errors in communication give rise to substantial clinical      morbidity and mortality  This paper explores the implications of acknowledging      the primacy of the communication space in informatics and explores some solutions      to communication difficulties  It also examines whether understanding the      dynamics of communication between human beings can also improve the way we design      information systems in health care  Using the concept of common ground in      conversation, proposals are suggested for modeling the common ground between a      system and human users  Such models provide insights into when communication or     computational systems are better suited to solving information problems

PMID- 10833163   - GeneClinics is an online genetic information resource consisting of descriptions       of specific inherited disorders  "disease profiles"  as well as information on      the role of genetic testing in the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling       of patients with these inherited conditions  GeneClinics is intended to promote      the use of genetic services in medical care and personal decision making by      providing health care practitioners and patients with information on genetic      testing for specific inherited disorders  GeneClinics is implemented as an      object-oriented database containing a combination of data and semistructured text      that is rendered as HTML for publishing a given "disease profile" on the Web       Content is acquired from authors via templates, converted to an XML document      reflecting the underlying database schema  with tagging of embedded data , and      then loaded into the database and subjected to peer review  The initial      implementation of a production system and the first phase of population of the      GeneClinics database content are complete  Further expansion of the content to      cover more disease, significant scaling up of rate of content creation, and      evaluation redesign are under way  The ultimate goal is to have an entry in      GeneClinics for each entry in the GeneTests directory of medical genetics      laboratories-that is, for each disease for which clinical genetic testing is      available

PMID- 10833162   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for Bayesian communication to enable readers to      make reported data more relevant by including their prior knowledge and values       BACKGROUND: To change their practice, clinicians need good evidence, yet they      also need to make new technology applicable to their local knowledge and      circumstances  Availability of the Web has the potential for greatly affecting      the scientific communication process between research and clinician  Going beyond      format changes and hyperlinking, Bayesian communication enables readers to make      reported data more relevant by including their prior knowledge and values  This      paper addresses the needs and implications for Bayesian communication       FORMULATION: Literature review and development of specifications from readers',      authors', publishers', and computers' perspectives consistent with formal      requirements for Bayesian reasoning  RESULTS: Seventeen specifications were      developed, which included eight for readers  express prior knowledge, view effect      size and variability, express threshold, make inferences, view explanation,      evaluate study and statistical quality, synthesize multiple studies, and view      prior beliefs of the community , three for authors  protect the author's      investment, publish enough information, make authoring easy , three for     publishers  limit liability, scale up, and establish a business model , and two      for computers  incorporate into reading process, use familiar interface      metaphors   A sample client-only prototype is available at      http://omie med jhmi edu/bayes  CONCLUSION: Bayesian communication has formal      justification consistent with the needs of readers and can best be implemented in      an online environment  Much research must be done to establish whether the      formalism and the reality of readers' needs can meet

PMID- 10833160   - The Internet represents a different type of technology for publishers of      scientific, technical, and medical journals  It is not a technology that sustains      current markets and creates new efficiencies but is, rather, a disruptive      technology that could radically alter market forces, profit expectations, and      business models  This paper is a translation and amplification of the research      done in this area, applied to a large-circulation new science journal,      Pediatrics  The findings suggest that the journal of the future will be      electronic, have a less volatile cost structure, be supported more by services      than by content, be less able to rely on subscription revenues, and abandon      certain elements of current value networks  It also provides a possible framework      for other publishers to use to evaluate their own journals relative to this      disruptive technology

PMID- 10833159   - The Internet is challenging traditional publishing patterns  In the biomedical      domain, medical journals are providing more and more content online, both free      and for a fee  Beyond this, however, a number of commentators believe that      traditional notions of copyright and intellectual property ownership are no      longer suited to the information age and that ownership of copyright to research       reports should be and will be wrested from publishers and returned to authors  In      this paper, it is argued that, although the Internet will indeed profoundly      affect the distribution of biomedical research results, the biomedical publishing      industry is too intertwined with the research establishment and too powerful to      fall prey to such a copyright revolution

PMID- 10833158   - Biomedical publishing stands at a crossroads  The traditional print,      peer-reviewed, subscription journal has served science well but is now being      called into question  Because of spiraling print journal costs and the worldwide       acceptance of the Internet as a valid publication medium, there is a compelling      opportunity to re-examine our current paradigm and future options  This report      illustrates the conflicts and restrictions inherent in the current publishing      model and examines how the single act of permitting authors to retain copyright      of their scholarly manuscripts may preserve the quality-control function of the      current journal system while allowing PubMed Central, the Internet archiving      system recently proposed by the director of the National Institutes of Health, to      simplify and liberate access to the world's biomedical literature

PMID- 10833157   - Information economics offers insights into the dynamics of information across      networked systems like the Internet  An information marketplace is different from      other marketplaces because an information good is not actually consumed and can      be reproduced and distributed at almost no cost  For information producers to      remain profitable, they will need to minimize their exposure to competition  For       example, information can be sold by charging site access rather than information       access fees, or it can be bundled with other information or "versioned " For     information consumers, a variation of Malthus' law predicts that the exponential       growth in information will mean that specific information will become      increasingly expensive to find, because search costs will grow but human      attention will remain limited  Furthermore, the low cost of creating poor-quality      information on the Web means that the low-quality information may eventually      swamp high-quality resources  The use of reputable information portals on the      Web, or smart search technologies, may help in the short run, but it is unclear     whether an "information famine" is avoidable in the longer term

PMID- 10730603   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of computer and manual reminder     systems on the implementation of a clinical practice guideline  DESIGN:      Seventy-eight outpatients in a mental health clinic were randomly assigned within      clinician to one of the two reminder systems  The computer system, called      CaseWalker, reminded clinicians when guideline-recommended screening for mood      disorder was due, ensured the fidelity of the diagnosis of major depressive      disorder to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental      Disorders, 4th edition  DSM-IV , and generated a progress note  The manual system      was a checklist inserted in the paper medical record  MEASURES: Screening rates      for mood disorder and the completeness of the documentation of which DSM-IV      criteria were met by patients who were said to have major depressive disorder     were compared  RESULTS: The CaseWalker, compared with the paper checklist,      resulted in a higher screening rate for mood disorder  86 5 vs  61 percent, P =      0 008  and a higher rate of complete documentation of DSM-IV criteria  100 vs       5 6 percent, P < 0 001   CONCLUSIONS: In an outpatient mental health clinic,      computer reminders were shown to be superior to manual reminders in improving      adherence to a clinical practice guideline for depression

PMID- 10730602   - OBJECTIVE: The authors have shown that clinical guidelines embedded in an      electronic medical record improved the quality, while lowering the cost, of care       for health care workers who incurred occupational exposures to body fluid  They      seek to determine whether this system has similar effects on the emergency      department care of young children with febrile illness  DESIGN: Off-on-off,      interrupted time series with intent-to-treat analysis  SETTING: University      hospital emergency department  SUBJECTS: 830 febrile children less than 3 years      of age and the physicians who treated them  INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of an      electronic medical record that provides real-time advice regarding the content of      the history and physical examination and recommendations regarding laboratory      testing, treatment, diagnosis, and disposition  MEASUREMENTS: Documentation of      essential items in the medical record and after-care instructions; compliance      with guidelines regarding testing, treatment, and diagnosis; charges  RESULTS:      The computer was used in 64 percent of eligible cases  Mean percentage      documentation of 21 essential history and physical examination items increased      from 80 percent during the baseline period to 92 percent in the intervention      phase  13 percent increase; 95 percent CI, 10-15 percent   Mean percentage      documentation of ten items in the after-care instructions increased from 48      percent at baseline to 81 percent during the intervention phase  33 percent      increase; 95 percent confidence interval, 28-38 percent   All documentation      decreased to baseline when the computer system was removed  There were no      demonstrable improvements in appropriateness of care, nor was there evidence that      appropriateness worsened  Mean charges were not changed by the intervention       CONCLUSION: The intervention markedly improved documentation, had little effect      on the appropriateness of the process of care, and had no effect on charges       Results for the febrile child module differ from those for the module for     occupational blood and body fluid exposure  a more focused and straightforward      medical condition , underscoring the need for implementation methods to be      tailored to specific clinical complaints

PMID- 10730601   - OBJECTIVE: While the use of multimedia methods in medical education and decision       support can facilitate learning, it also has certain hazards  One potential      hazard is the inadvertent triggering of racial and gender bias by the appearance       of actors or patients in presentations  The authors hypothesized that race and      gender affect preferences  To explore this issue they studied the effects of      actors' race and gender on preference ratings for health states that include      symptoms of schizophrenia  DESIGN: A convenience sample of patients with      schizophrenia, family members of patients, and health professionals was used       Participants were randomly assigned to rate two health states, one portrayed by      either a man of mixed race  Hispanic-black  or a white man and the second      portrayed by either a white woman or a white man  MEASURements: Visual analog      scale  VAS  and standard gamble ratings of health state preferences for health      states that include symptoms of mild and moderate schizophrenia  RESULTS: Studies      of the effects of the race of the actor  n = 114  revealed that racial mismatch      between the actor and the participant affected the participant's preferences for       health states  Ratings were lower when racial groups differed  mean difference,      0 098 for visual analog scale ratings and 0 053 lower in standard gamble, P =      0 006 for interactions between the race of the subject and the actor   In studies      of the effects of a female actress on ratings  n = 117 , we found no evidence of       a corresponding interaction between the gender of the actor and the study      participant  Rather, an interaction between actor's gender and method of      assessment was observed  Standard gamble ratings  difference between means,      0 151 , but not visual analog scale ratings  difference, 0 005 , were markedly      higher when the state was portrayed by the actress  P = 0 003 for interactions      between actor's gender and method of preference assessment   Differential effects      on standard gamble ratings suggest that an actor's gender may influence the      willingness of viewers to gamble to gain health benefits  or risk attitude        CONCLUSIONS: Educators and researchers considering the use of multimedia methods       for decision support need to be aware of the potential for the race and gender of      patients or actors to influence preferences for health states and thus,      potentially, medical decisions

PMID- 10730600   - Despite the general adoption of graphical users interfaces  GUIs  in health care,      few empirical data document the impact of this move on system users  This study      compares two distinctly different user interfaces, a legacy text-based interface       and a prototype graphical interface, for differences in nurses' response time       RT , errors, and satisfaction when the interfaces are used in the performance of      computerized nursing order tasks  In a medical center on the East Coast of the      United States, 98 randomly selected male and female nurses completed 40 tasks      using each interface  Nurses completed four different types of order tasks       create, activate, modify, and discontinue   Using a repeated-measures and Latin       square design, the study was counterbalanced for tasks, interface types, and      blocks of trials  Overall, nurses had significantly faster response times  P <      0 0001  and fewer errors  P < 0 0001  using the prototype GUI than the text-based      interface  The GUI was also rated significantly higher for satisfaction than the       text system, and the GUI was faster to leam  P < 0 0001   Therefore, the results       indicated that the use of a prototype GUI for nursing orders significantly      enhances user performance and satisfaction  Consideration should be given to      redesigning older user interfaces to create more modern ones by using human      factors principles and input from user-centered focus groups  Future work should       examine prospective nursing interfaces for highly complex interactions in      computer-based patient records, detail the severity of errors made on line, and      explore designs to optimize interactions in life-critical systems

PMID- 10730599   - Most health care databases include time-stamped instant data as the only temporal      representation of patient information  Many previous efforts have attempted to      provide frameworks in which medical databases could be queried in relation to      time  These, however, have required either a sophisticated database      representation of time, including time intervals, or a time-stamp-based database       coupled with a nonstandard temporal query language  In this work, the authors      demonstrate how their previously described data retrieval application, DXtractor,      can be used as a database querying application with expressive power close to      that of temporal databases and temporal query languages, using only standard SQL       and existing time-stamp-based repositories  DXtractor provides the ability to      compose temporal queries through an interface that is understood by      nonprogramming medical personnel  Not all temporal constructs are easily      implemented using this framework; nonetheless, DXtractor's temporal capabilities       provide a significant improvement in the temporal expressivity accessible to      clinicians using standard time-stamped clinical databases

PMID- 10730598   - Citation of scientific materials published on the Internet is often cumbersome      because of unwieldy uniform resource locators  URLs   The authors describe a      format for URLs that simplifies citation of scholarly materials  Its use depends       on a simple HTML device, the "refresh page " Uniform citation would follow this      format: [Author I  Title of article  http:// domain/year/month-day e#  html]  The      HTML code for such a page is:  HTML   head   meta HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh"      CONTENT="0; URL= http://Actual-URL/ for-article/ referred-to/ incitation html"        /head   /HTML   The code instructs the browser to suppress the content of the      refresh page and bring up the title page of the cited article instead  Citations       would be succinct and predictable  An electronic journal would not need to alter       its existing file hierarchy but would need to establish a distinct domain name      and maintain a file of refresh pages  Utilization of the "shadow" URL would bring      us one step closer to truly universal resource locators

PMID- 10730596   - The vision of integrating information-from a variety of sources, into the way      people work, to improve decisions and process-is one of the cornerstones of      biomedical informatics  Thoughts on how this vision might be realized have      evolved as improvements in information and communication technologies, together     with discoveries in biomedical informatics, and have changed the art of the      possible  This review identified three distinct generations of "integration"      projects  First-generation projects create a database and use it for multiple      purposes  Second-generation projects integrate by bringing information from      various sources together through enterprise information architecture       Third-generation projects inter-relate disparate but accessible information      sources to provide the appearance of integration  The review suggests that the      ideas developed in the earlier generations have not been supplanted by ideas from      subsequent generations  Instead, the ideas represent a continuum of progress      along the three dimensions of workflow, structure, and extraction

PMID- 10730594   - As increasingly powerful informatics systems are designed, developed, and      implemented, they inevitably affect larger, more heterogeneous groups of people      and more organizational areas  In turn, the major challenges to system success      are often more behavioral than technical  Successfully introducing such systems      into complex health care organizations requires an effective blend of good      technical and good organizational skills  People who have low psychological      ownership in a system and who vigorously resist its implementation can bring a      "technically best" system to its knees  However, effective leadership can sharply      reduce the behavioral resistance to change-including to new technologies-to      achieve a more rapid and productive introduction of informatics technology  This       paper looks at four major areas-why information system failures occur, the core      theories supporting change management, the practical applications of change      management, and the change management efforts in informatics

PMID- 10641966   - This paper presents the equity implementation model  EIM  in the context of a      case that describes the implementation of a medical scheduling system  The model       is based on equity theory, a well-established theory in the social sciences that       has been tested in hundreds of experimental and field studies  The predictions of      equity theory have been supported in organizational, societal, family, and other       social settings  Thus, the EIM helps provide a theory-based understanding for     collecting and reviewing users' reactions to, and acceptance or rejection of, a      new technology or system  The case study  implementation of a patient scheduling       and appointment setting system in a large health maintenance organization       illustrates how the EIM can be used to examine users' reactions to the      implementation of a new system

PMID- 10641965   - OBJECTIVE: A type definition, as a component of the categorical structures of a      concept-oriented terminology, must support nonambiguous concept representations      and, consequently, comparisons of data that are represented using different      terminologies  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the adequacy and utility       of a proposed type definition for nursing activity concepts  DESIGN: Nursing      activity terms  n = 1039  from patient charts and intervention terms from two      nursing terminologies  Home Health Care Classification and Omaha System  were      decomposed into the attributes of the proposed type definition-Delivery Mode,      Activity Focus, and Recipient  MEASUREMENTS: Attributes of the type definition      were coded as present or absent for each term by multiple raters  In addition,      Delivery Mode was rated as Explicit or Implicit and Recipient was rated as      Explicit, Implicit, or Ambiguous  The data were summarized using descriptive      statistics  Inter-rater reliabilities were calculated for each attribute of the      type definition  RESULTS: All attributes of the type definition were present in      73 9 percent of the chart terms, 91 3 percent of Home Health Care Classification       intervention terms, and 63 5 percent of Omaha System intervention terms  While      Delivery Mode and Activity Focus were almost universally present, Recipient was      problematic  It was rated as ambiguous in 4 8 percent of the chart terms, 8 7      percent of Home Health Care Classification intervention terms, and 36 5 percent      of Omaha System intervention terms  CONCLUSIONS: The study findings supported the      adequacy and utility of the type definition  Further research is needed to refine      the type definition and its use for representing nursing activity concepts within      a concept-oriented terminological system

PMID- 10641964   - OBJECTIVE: The Unified Medical Language System  UMLS  combines many      well-established authoritative medical informatics terminologies in one knowledge      representation system  Such a resource is very valuable to the health care      community and industry  However, the UMLS is very large and complex and poses      serious comprehension problems for users and maintenance personnel  The authors      present a representation to support the user's comprehension and navigation of      the UMLS  DESIGN: An object-oriented database  OODB  representation is used to      represent the two major components of the UMLS-the Metathesaurus and the Semantic      Network-as a unified system  The semantic types of the Semantic Network are      modeled as semantic type classes  Intersection classes are defined to model      concepts of multiple semantic types, which are removed from the semantic type      classes  RESULTS: The authors provide examples of how the intersection classes      help expose omissions of concepts, highlight errors of semantic type      classification, and uncover ambiguities of concepts in the UMLS  The resulting      UMLS OODB schema is deeper and more refined than the Semantic Network, since      intersection classes are introduced  The Metathesaurus is classified into more      mutually exclusive, uniform sets of concepts  The schema improves the user's      comprehension and navigation of the Metathesaurus  CONCLUSIONS: The UMLS OODB      schema supports the user's comprehension and navigation of the Metathesaurus  It       also helps expose and resolve modeling problems in the UMLS

PMID- 10641963   - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether clinical data routinely available in a      computerized patient record  CPR  can be used to drive a complex guideline that      supports physicians in real time and at the point of care in assessing the risk      of mortality for patients with community-acquired pneumonia  SETTING: Emergency      department of a tertiary-care hospital  DESIGN: Retrospective analysis with      medical chart review  PATIENTS: All 241 inpatients during a 17-month period  Jun       1995 to Nov 1996  who presented to the emergency department and had a primary      discharge diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia  METHODS/MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURES: The 20 guideline variables were extracted from the CPR  HELP System       and the paper chart  The risk score and the risk class of the Pneumonia Severity       Index were computed using data from the CPR alone and from a reference standard      of all data available in the paper chart and the CPR at the time of the emergency      department encounters  Availability and concordance were quantified to determine       data quality  The type and cause of errors were analyzed depending on the source       and format of the clinical variables  RESULTS: Of the 20 guideline variables, 12       variables were required to be present for every computer-charted emergency      department patient, seven variables were required for selected patients only, and      one variable was not typically available in the HELP System during a patient's      encounter  The risk class was identical for 86 7 percent of the patients  The      majority of patients with different risk classes were assigned too low a risk      class  The risk scores were identical for 72 1 percent of the patients  The      average availability was 0 99 for the data elements that were required to be      present and 0 79 for the data elements that were not required to be present  The       average concordance was 0 98 when all a patient's variables were taken into      account  The cause of error was attributed to the nurse charting in 77 percent of      the cases and to the computerized evaluation in 23 percent  The type of error     originated from the free-text fields in 64 percent, from coded fields in 21      percent, from vital signs in 14 percent, and from laboratory results in 1      percent  CONCLUSION: From a clinical perspective, the current level of data      quality in the HELP System supports the automation and the prospective evaluation      of the Pneumonia Severity Index as a computerized decision support tool

PMID- 10641962   - OBJECTIVE: To query a clinical data repository  CDR  for answers to clinical      questions to determine whether different types of fields  coded and free text       would yield confirmatory, complementary, or conflicting information and to      discuss the issues involved in producing the discrepancies between the fields       METHODS: The appropriate data fields in a subset of a CDR  5,135 patient records       were searched for the answers to three questions related to surgical procedures        Each search included at least one coded data field and at least one free-text      field  The identified free-text records were then searched manually to ensure      correct interpretation  The fields were then compared to determine whether they      agreed with each other, were supportive of each other, contained no entry       absence of data , or were contradictory  RESULTS: The degree of concordance      varied greatly according to the field and the question asked  Some fields were      not granular enough to answer the question  The free-text fields often gave an      answer that was not definitive  Absence of data was most logically interpreted in      some cases as lack of completion of data and in others as a negative answer  Even      with a question as specific as which side a hernia was on, contradictory data      were found in 5 to 8 percent of the records  CONCLUSIONS: Using the data in the      CDR to answer clinical questions can yield significantly disparate results      depending on the question and which data fields are searched  A database cannot      just be queried in automated fashion and the results reported  Both coded and      textual fields must be searched to obtain the fullest assessment  This can be      expected to result in information that may be confirmatory, complementary, or     conflicting  To yield the most accurate information possible, final answers to      questions require human judgment and may require the gathering of additional      information

PMID- 10641961   - OBJECTIVE: To design a pattern recognition engine based on concepts derived from       mammalian immune systems  DESIGN: A supervised learning system  Immunos-81  was      created using software abstractions of T cells, B cells, antibodies, and their     interactions  Artificial T cells control the creation of B-cell populations       clones , which compete for recognition of "unknowns " The B-cell clone with the       "simple highest avidity"  SHA  or "relative highest avidity"  RHA  is considered       to have successfully classified the unknown  MEASUREMENT: Two standard machine      learning data sets, consisting of eight nominal and six continuous variables,      were used to test the recognition capabilities of Immunos-81  The first set       Cleveland , consisting of 303 cases of patients with suspected coronary artery      disease, was used to perform a ten-way cross-validation  After completing the      validation runs, the Cleveland data set was used as a training set prior to      presentation of the second data set, consisting of 200 unknown cases  RESULTS:      For cross-validation runs, correct recognition using SHA ranged from a high of 96      percent to a low of 63 2 percent  The average correct classification for all runs      was 83 2 percent  Using the RHA metric, 11 2 percent were labeled "too close to      determine" and no further attempt was made to classify them  Of the remaining      cases, 85 5 percent were correctly classified  When the second data set was      presented, correct classification occurred in 73 5 percent of cases when SHA was       used and in 80 3 percent of cases when RHA was used  CONCLUSIONS: The immune      system offers a viable paradigm for the design of pattern recognition systems       Additional research is required to fully exploit the nuances of immune      computation

PMID- 10641959   - A variety of methods have been proposed for presenting medical data visually on      computers  Discussion of and comparison among these methods have been hindered by      a lack of consistent terminology  A taxonomy of medical data presentations based       on object-oriented user interface principles is presented  Presentations are      divided into five major classes-list, table, graph, icon, and generated text       These are subdivided into eight subclasses with simple inheritance and four     subclasses with multiple inheritance  The various subclasses are reviewed and      examples are provided  Issues critical to the development and evaluation of      presentations are also discussed
