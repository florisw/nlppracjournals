METHODS: We surveyed all tertiary teaching and general hospitals in      Korea. The degree to which EHR systems were adopted was evaluated using the      previously defined definitions of 'comprehensive' and 'basic' EHRs based on their     electronic functionality. The effects of teaching status, size, and location of      hospitals on EHR adoption were examined. We also investigated factors that      impeded or facilitated the adoption of EHR systems. RESULTS: The response rate      was 39.0% (122/313), and 37.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.9-42.6%) of      Korean tertiary teaching and general hospitals had either basic or comprehensive       EHR systems (50.2% of tertiary teaching hospitals, 35.0% of general hospitals).      However, only 5.0% (CI 2.6-7.4%) had comprehensive EHR systems. Most Korean      tertiary teaching and general hospitals, i.e., 87.0% (95% CI, 83.3-90.7%), have      implemented computerized provider order-entry (CPOE) systems for medications,      with larger hospitals more likely than smaller ones to have adopted some sort of       EHRs (p-value<0.001). However, the prevalence of these systems did not differ     according to the location of the hospital (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan).      According to the survey data, the capital requirements and high maintenance costs      of EHR systems were the major barriers to their adoption, and government      reimbursement or incentives were the most requested facilitators of their     adoption. CONCLUSION: The rate at which EHR and CPOE for medications systems have      been adopted by Korean tertiary teaching and general hospitals was higher than      the rate of adoption by US hospitals. Financial aspects are reported to be the      most important facilitators of and barriers to EHR adoption. Government financial      support, especially to small hospitals, seems to be essential to promoting the      adoption of EHRs by Korean hospitals.   - PURPOSE: To investigate use of a new guideline-based, computerized clinical      decision support (CCDS) system for asthma in a pediatric pulmonology clinic of a       large academic medical center. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative evaluation      including review of electronic data, direct observation, and interviews with all       nine pediatric pulmonologists in the clinic. Outcome measures included patterns      of computer use in relation to patient care, and themes surrounding the      relationship between asthma care and computer use. RESULTS: The pediatric      pulmonologists entered enough data to trigger the decision support system in      397/445 (89.2%) of all asthma visits from January 2009 to May 2009. However,      interviews and direct observations revealed use of the decision support system      was limited to documentation activities after clinic sessions ended. Reasons for       delayed use reflected barriers common to general medical care and barriers      specific to subspecialty care. Subspecialist-specific barriers included the      perceived high complexity of patients, the impact of subject matter expertise on       the types of decision support needed, and unique workflow concerns such as the      need to create letters to referring physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric      pulmonologists demonstrated low use of a computerized decision support system for     asthma care because of a combination of general and subspecialist-specific      factors. Subspecialist-specific factors should not be underestimated when      designing guideline-based, computerized decision support systems for the      subspecialty setting.

PMID- 22192460   - Given the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity in primary care (PC),      interdisciplinary PC teams supported by appropriate clinical information systems       (CIS) are needed in order to deal with the complexity of multimorbid patients'      care. Our team has developed such a system, called the Da Vinci system. However,       despite the expected benefits, evidence suggests generally low rates of CIS      adoption. To optimize adoption in PC settings, a better understanding of the      implementation process of such systems is crucial. PURPOSE: To identify user     profiles, investigate the drivers of and barriers to adoption and use of the Da      Vinci system, a PC tailored CIS, and understand the dynamics of the CIS adoption       for each profile. METHODS: Using a longitudinal approach, we conducted a      qualitative study (individual interviews, documentation and observation) based on      the Diffusion of Innovation theory. It included 31 participants (primary care      physicians, staff or residents, nurses, pharmacists) from two Family Medicine      Groups in Quebec (Canada). RESULTS: The different user profiles drawn from the      dynamics of implementation are linked to different sets of perceived drivers and       barriers that evolve over time. Certain factors favour the decision of adopting      Da Vinci early on: e.g. user skills and the system's expected ease of use and      usefulness. Certain concerns hinder its adoption: e.g. perceived negative impact       on the doctor-patient relationship. Over time, 5 factors appear to be related to       more advanced exploitation of the system's functionalities: user skills, ease of       use, comfort using the system in front of patients, support from colleagues and,       more importantly, perceived positive impacts. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding      of the dynamics of CIS implementation provides insight into how best to encourage      clinicians to adopt and make full use of such systems to improve the quality of      care for multimorbid patients followed in PC settings.

PMID- 22178295   - BACKGROUND: The shortage of doctors and nurses, along with future expansion into       rural clinics, will require that the majority of clinic visits by HIV infected      patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are managed by non-doctors. The goal of       this study was to develop and evaluate a screening protocol to determine which      patients needed a full clinical assessment and which patients were stable enough       to receive their medications without a doctor's consultation. For this study, we       developed an electronic, handheld tool to guide non-physician counselors through       screening questions. METHODS: Patients visiting two ART clinics in South Africa      for routine follow-up visits between March 2007 and April 2008 were included in      our study. Each patient was screened by non-physician counselors using the      handheld device and then received a full clinical assessment. Clinicians' report       on whether full clinical assessment had been necessary was used as the gold      standard for determining "required referral". Observations were randomly divided       into two datasets--989 for developing a referral protocol and 200 for validating       protocol performance. RESULTS: A third of patients had at least one physical      complaint, and 16% had five or more physical complaints. 38% of patients required      referral for full clinical assessment. We identify a subset of questions which      are 87% sensitive and 47% specific for recommended patient referral. CONCLUSIONS:      The final screening protocol is highly sensitive and could reduce burden on ART      clinicians by 30%. The uptake and acceptance of the handheld tool to support      implementation of the protocol was high. Further examination of the data reveals       several important questions to include in future referral algorithms to improve      sensitivity and specificity. Based on these results, we identify a refined      algorithm to explore in future evaluations.

PMID- 22178294   - PURPOSE: The Arabic language uses notations called diacritical marks around      characters to change which letter a symbol represents, changing the word in which      that letter is contained. We explore the potential for error of these marks when       faxed in a critical case such as prescriptions. A large number of patients are      hurt by medical errors each year. Extensive literature already documents the      risks from handwritten prescriptions, while little work has been done with risks       from reproduced printed prescriptions. No literature exists to examine risks of      prescriptions in non-Roman character alphabets being reproduced. Reproduction via      fax transmission is a common practice and often produces damaged copies which can      lead to medication errors. Languages with diacritical marks, particularly small      ones, used for critical contextual meaning would more likely be at risk for     misreading due to fax damage. METHODS: We generated text in English and Arabic      reproducing common prescribing instructions, such as "every day" at various font       sizes. This was placed on commonly used prescription paper, and reproduced via      fax between 2 medical facility fax machines. RESULTS: We demonstrate meaningful      change of prescribing instructions in the Arabic text by both the fax compression      algorithm changing the appearance of diacritical marks along with a large amount       of stochastic noise and dropouts being present. This change produced a      potentially dangerous change in the instructions in the example we present.      CONCLUSIONS: Prescriptions that are faxed in languages that use diacritical marks      to denote contextual meaning, are at high risk for misreading when reproduced via      fax. We suggest mitigating strategies, including minimal font size and use of      alliteration text in other languages.

PMID- 22104370   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous reviews have expressed concerns about the      quality of telemedicine studies. There is debate about shortcomings and      appropriate methodologies. The aim of this review of systematic reviews of      telemedicine is to summarize methodologies used in telemedicine research, discuss      knowledge gaps and recommendations and suggest methodological approaches for     further research. METHODS: We conducted a review of systematic reviews of      telemedicine according to a protocol listing explicit methods, selection      criteria, data collection and quality assessment procedures. We included reviews       where authors explicitly addressed and made recommendations for assessment      methodologies. We did a qualitative analysis of the reviews included, sensitized       by two broad methodological positions; positivist and naturalistic approaches.      The analysis focused on methodologies used in the primary studies included in the      reviews as reported by the review authors, and methodological recommendations      made by the review authors. RESULTS: We identified 1593 titles/abstracts. We      included 50 reviews that explicitly addressed assessment methodologies. One group      of reviews recommended larger and more rigorously designed controlled studies to       assess the impacts of telemedicine; a second group proposed standardisation of      populations, and/or interventions and outcome measures to reduce heterogeneity      and facilitate meta-analysis; a third group recommended combining quantitative      and qualitative research methods; and others applying different naturalistic      approaches including methodologies addressing mutual adaptations of services and       users; politically driven action research and formative research aimed at      collaboration to ensure capacity for improvement of services in natural settings.      CONCLUSIONS: Larger and more rigorous studies are crucial for the production of      evidence of effectiveness of unambiguous telemedicine services for pre defined      outcome measures. Summative methodologies acknowledging telemedicine as complex      innovations and outcomes as partly contingent on values, meanings and contexts      are also important. So are formative, naturalistic methodologies that acknowledge      telemedicine as ongoing collaborative achievements and engage with stakeholders,       including patients to produce and conceptualise new and effective telemedicine      innovations.

PMID- 22088601   - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand the preparations for the      introduction of electronic patient record systems (EPRs) within the outpatient      services department of a large acute hospital based in the UK. In particular, one      of the main aims of the study was to examine in detail the likely impact of EPRs       on the working practices of healthcare workers, their expectations regarding the       impact of EPRs within the department and other sociotechnical aspects of the      management of patient information. METHODS: Twenty-seven semi-structured      interviews were undertaken with staff in a variety of roles that deal with the      management of medical records. The interviews focused on the organisation of the       medical records department and current problems (e.g., missing records). In      addition, the interviews contained questions about the specific role of medical      records supervisors in the administration of records, as well as pathways and      expectations about EPRs more generally. The data from the interviews was analysed      using a mixture of thematic and template analysis and coded using constructs from      a sociotechnical model of information system implementation and adoption.      RESULTS: The findings show that despite severe delays to the nationally led      (NPfIT) roll-out of EPRs and associated IT infrastructure within the UK, staff      attitudes within the department were broadly positive about the potential of      future EPRs to deliver efficiencies (e.g., improved workflow within the      department, reduced reliance on paper-based systems). One of the main influences       on attitudes towards the type of EPRs that should exist within outpatients was      prompted by negative reactions to the way in which NPfIT systems had been managed      and attempted to be introduced in the past. A strong commitment to end-user     involvement in EPRs design, together with a rejection of NPfIT, appears to have      shaped attitudes towards future expectations of the adoption of new EPRs within      the department. In addition, staff do not believe that a rapid change to      'paperless' working is likely to be possible. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide      further evidence that there is a need to treat the implementation of EPRs not      simply as an exercise in technical system delivery, but as a larger process of      sociotechnical systems change. We conclude the paper with some guidelines, the      aim of which is to provide guidance regarding EPRs implementation and adoption      informed by sociotechnical principles and ideas.

PMID- 22079242   - PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the functionality      of structured data entry templates using the entity-attribute-value (EAV) model      for clinical decision support of pressure ulcer wound management. METHODS: A data      set for wound assessment of pressure ulcers that has commonly been recommended by      clinical practice guidelines was identified, and then the EAV models on each data      were developed. Structured data entry templates and a database were developed      based on these EAV models. These were integrated with a knowledge engine into the      clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide patient-specific      recommendations on pressure ulcer wound management. The functionality of the EAV       model and structured data entry templates for the CDSS was evaluated      heuristically by five nurse experts using clinical scenarios. RESULTS: The data      set containing 13 entities was identified and EAV models of these entities were      created. Cardinalities and data types of attributes were defined to represent the      models in more detail. Terms used in the EAV models were mapped to SNOMED CT      concepts. Six data entry templates and the relational database with ten tables      were developed. Five nurses successfully entered all data in the scenarios except      one data element and retrieved expected recommendations successfully from the      clinical decision support system when all data were entered correctly.      CONCLUSIONS: The clinical data models and structured data entry templates      developed in this study were useful in supporting clinical decision making on      pressure ulcer wound management.

PMID- 22079240   - PURPOSE: Despite the amount of health information available online, there are      several barriers that limit the Internet from being adopted as a source of health      information. The purpose of this study was to identify individual skill-related      problems that users experience when accessing the Internet for health information      and services. METHODS: Between November 2009 and February 2010, 88 subjects      participated in a performance test in which participants had to complete      health-related assignments on the Internet. Subjects were randomly selected from       a telephone book. A selective quota sample was used and was divided over equal      subsamples of gender, age, and education. Each subject was required to complete      nine assignments on the Internet. RESULTS: The general population experiences      many Internet skill-related problems, especially those related to information and      strategic Internet skills. Aging and lower levels of education seemed to      contribute to the amount of operational and formal skill-related problems      experienced. Saving files, bookmarking websites, and using search engines were      troublesome for these groups of people. With respect to information skills, the      higher the level of educational attainment, the less problems the participants      experienced. Although younger subjects experienced far less operational and      formal skill-related problems, it was revealed that older subjects were less      likely to select and use irrelevant search results and unreliable sources.      Concerning the strategic Internet skills it was revealed that older subjects were      less likely to make inappropriate decisions based on information gathered.      CONCLUSIONS: The amount of online health-related information and services is      consistently growing; however, it appears that the general population experiences      many skill-related problems, particularly those related to information and      strategic Internet skills, and they become very important when it comes to      health. These skills are also problematic for younger generations who are often      seen as skilled Internet users. The results of the study call for policies that      account for low levels of Internet skills.

PMID- 22078107   - INTRODUCTION: The implementation of smart pump technology can reduce the      incidence of errors in the administration of intravenous drugs. This approach      involves developing drug libraries for specific units and setting hard and soft      limits for each drug. If a programming error occurs and these limits are      exceeded, an alarm sounds and the infusion can be blocked. A detailed analysis of      these alarms is essential in order not to bias the results in favor of a positive      impact of this technology. PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of the first analysis      of the use of smart infusion pumps and to assess the significance and practical      implications of the alarms sounded. METHODS: The study was performed by a      multidisciplinary team that consisted of a clinical pharmacist, a pediatrician      from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and the chief nurse of the unit. A      library of 108 drugs was developed over a 7-month period and introduced into 40      syringe pumps and 12 volumetric pumps (Alaris((R)) with Plus software) before      being applied in 6 of the 11 beds in the PICU. After four month's use, data were       analyzed using the Guardrails((R)) CQI v4.1 Event Reporter program. RESULTS:      Following the first four months of implementation, compliance with the drug      library was 87%. By analyzing the alerts triggered, we were able to detect      problems such as the need to increase user training, readjust limits that did not      correspond to clinical practice, correct errors in the editing of the drug      library and including a training profile. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to obtain      accurate data on the true impact of this technology in the early stages of its      implementation. This preliminary analysis allowed us to identify improvement      measures to distinguish, in future evaluations, the alarms triggered by a real      programming error from those caused by incorrect use.

PMID- 22071012   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to gain a better insight into the reasons      why hospital physicians accept and use a Picture Archiving and Communication      System (PACS). Two research questions are put forward, pertaining to (1) factors       that contribute to physicians' acceptance of PACS, and (2) whether these factors       change as physicians gain experience in using PACS. METHODS: Questionnaires were       administered at three moments in time during the PACS implementation process in a      private hospital: just before its introduction (T1), four months later (T2), and       about fifteen months after the introduction of PACS (T3). The Unified Theory of      Acceptance and Use of Technology was chosen as the theoretical framework for this      study. Hence, the following scales were measured: performance expectancy, effort       expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, and       self-reported frequency of use. RESULTS: Forty-six usable responses were obtained      at T1, 52 at T2 and 61 at T3. Three variables directly influenced PACS acceptance      (measured as behavioral intention and use of PACS): effort expectancy,      performance expectancy, and social influence; and their influence evolved over     time. Effort expectancy was of particular importance at T1, whereas performance      expectancy influenced acceptance at T2 and T3; social influence was the only      consistent predictor of PACS acceptance at all times. Variance explained in      behavioral intention ranged from .26 at T1 to .58 at T3. CONCLUSIONS: In this      setting, the main motivation for physicians to start using PACS is effort      expectancy, whereas performance expectancy only becomes important after the      physicians started using PACS. It is also very important that physicians perceive      that their social environment encourages the use of PACS.

PMID- 22071011   - INTRODUCTION: Although the use of computerized decision support systems (CDSS) in      glucose control in the ICU has been reported, little is known about the effect of      the systems' operating modes on the quality of glucose control. The objective of       this study was to evaluate the effect of providing patient-specific and patient      non-specific computerized advice on timing of blood glucose level (BGL)      measurements. Our hypothesis was that both levels of support would be effective      for improving the quality of glucose regulation and safety, with patient specific      advice being the most effective strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective      study was performed in a 30-bed mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU)       of a university hospital. In phase 1 the CDSS provided non-specific advice and      thereafter, in phase 2, the system provided specific advice on timing of BGL      measurements. The primary outcome measure was delay in BGL measurements before      and after the two levels of support. Secondary endpoints were sampling frequency,      mean BGL, BGL within pre-defined targets, time to capture target, incidences of      severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. These indicators were analyzed over the      course of time using Statistical Control Charts. The analysis was restricted to      patients with at least two blood glucose measurements. RESULTS: Data of 3934      patient admissions were evaluated, which corresponded to 119,116 BGL      measurements. The BGL sampling interval, delays in BG sampling, and percentage of      hypoglycemia all decreased after introducing either of the two levels of decision      support. The effect was however larger for the patient specific CDSS. Mean BGL,      time to capture target, hyperglycemia index, percentage of hyperglycemia events      and "in range" measurements remained unchanged and stable after introducing both       patient non-specific and patient specific decision support. CONCLUSION: Adherence      to protocol sampling rules increased by using decision support with a larger     effect at the patient specific level. This led to a decrease in the percentage of      hypoglycemia events and improved safety. The use of the CDSS at both levels,      however, did not improve the quality of glucose control as measured by our     indicators. More research is needed to investigate whether other socio-technical       factors are in play.

PMID- 22047627   - PURPOSE: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) supports physicians in their improvement      of clinical quality and enhances hospitals' improvement of patient safety. Many      health care institutions implement information systems to support physicians      practicing EBM. However, studies exploring the antecedent factors of physicians'       usage intention of information systems facilitating EBM practice are rare. Hence       this study proposed a research model based on the decomposed theory of the      planned behavior model (decomposed TPB) to investigate the factors influencing      physicians' acceptance of the Medline system. METHODS: A field survey was      conducted in Taiwan to collect data from physicians with experience in using the       Medline system. A valid sample of 224 physicians was collected for data analysis.      Structural equation modeling using the partial least squares (PLS) method with      bootstrap estimate was used to test the research model. RESULTS: The findings of       this study show that a physician's usage intention is significantly influenced by      three factors, i.e. attitude, the subjective norm, and perceived behavior     control. Furthermore, these three factors can be predicted by perceived      usefulness and perceived ease of use, interpersonal influence, personal      innovativeness in IT and self-efficacy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of      this study indicate that our research model provides an effective prediction of      the intention of physicians to use the Medline system and provides valuable      implications for academics and practitioners.

PMID- 22030036   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usability of a large compositional interface      terminology based on SNOMED CT and the terminology application for registration      of the reasons for intensive care admission in a Patient Data Management System.       DESIGN: Observational study with user-based usability evaluations before and 3      months after the system was implemented and routinely used. MEASUREMENTS:      Usability was defined by five aspects: effectiveness, efficiency, learnability,      overall user satisfaction, and experienced usability problems. Qualitative (the      Think-Aloud user testing method) and quantitative (the System Usability Scale      questionnaire and Time-on-Task analyses) methods were used to examine these      usability aspects. RESULTS: The results of the evaluation study revealed that the      usability of the interface terminology fell short (SUS scores before and after     implementation of 47.2 out of 100 and 37.5 respectively out of 100). The      qualitative measurements revealed a high number (n=35) of distinct usability      problems, leading to ineffective and inefficient registration of reasons for     admission. The effectiveness and efficiency of the system did not change over     time. About 14% (n=5) of the revealed usability problems were related to the      terminology content based on SNOMED CT, while the remaining 86% (n=30) was      related to the terminology application. The problems related to the terminology      content were more severe than the problems related to the terminology      application. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed insight into how      clinicians interact with a controlled compositional terminology through a      terminology application. The extensiveness, complexity of the hierarchy, and the       language usage of an interface terminology are defining for its usability.      Carefully crafted domain-specific subsets and a well-designed terminology      application are needed to facilitate the use of a complex compositional interface      terminology based on SNOMED CT.

PMID- 22030035   - BACKGROUND: Web sites with health-oriented content are potentially harmful if      inaccurate or inappropriate medical information is used to make health-related      decisions. Checklists, rating systems and guidelines have been developed to help       people determine what is credible, but recent Internet technologies emphasize      applications that are collaborative in nature, including tags and tag clouds,      where site users 'tag' or label online content, each using their own labelling      system. Concepts such as the date, reference, author, testimonial and quotations       are considered predictors of credible content. An understanding of these      descriptive tools, how they relate to the depiction of credibility and how this      relates to overall efforts to label data in relation to the semantic web has yet       to emerge. PURPOSE: This study investigates how structured (pre-determined) and      unstructured (user-generated) tags and tag clouds with a multiple word search      feature are used by participants to assess credibility of messages posted in      online message forums. The targeted respondents were those using web sites      message forums for disease self-management. We also explored the relevancy of our     findings to the labelling or indexing of data in the context of the semantic web.      METHOD: Diabetes was chosen as the content area in this study, since (a) this is       a condition with increasing prevalence and (b) diabetics have been shown to      actively use the Internet to manage their condition. From January to March 2010      participants were recruited using purposive sampling techniques. A screening      instrument was used to determine eligibility. The study consisted of a      demographic and computer usage survey, a series of usability tests and an      interview. We tested participants (N=22) on two scenarios, each involving tasks      that assessed their ability to tag content and search using a tag cloud that      included six structured credibility terms (statistics, date, reference, author,      testimonial and quotations). MORAE Usability software (version 3.1) was employed       to record participants' use of the study environment. The surveys were analyzed      using SPSS version 17. Interviews with participants were transcribed, coded and      analyzed using thematic text analysis with the aid of NVivo8. FINDINGS: Most      participants had experience with Internet resources. However, less than one      quarter of this sample had seen or used tags or a tag clouds. The ways in which      participants used tags to label the content posted in the message forums varied.       Some participants were tagging the information for their own subsequent use,      whereas others viewed this process from the perspective of others: they tagged      the content in ways that they thought other users would find beneficial. Many      participants did not use the structured credibility tags when asked to search for     credible content. The interviews corroborated these findings by confirming      participants were not considering credibility foremost when tagging. CONCLUSION:       Many participants in this study focused on assessing whether the information was       relevant to their current circumstances, after which they would proceed to      determine its credibility by corroborating with other sources. The use of      structured tags to label information may not be a useful way to encourage the use      of tagging, or to indicate credibility in this context. Current applications used      in the semantic web automate this process. Therefore it may be useful to engage      consumers of online content, in particular health-related content, to be more      directly involved in the annotation of this content.

PMID- 22020199   - OBJECTIVES: To develop health information leaflets for people aged 18-30 about      the links between lifestyle and cancer. To devise a lightweight method for     evaluating the usability of health information leaflets. To evaluate the      usability of leaflets, particularly their effectiveness, in raising awareness      about the links between lifestyle and cancer. METHODS: A combination of methods      was used. A focus group, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were      carried out with members of the public, healthcare practitioners and design      professionals to collect requirements for the design of healthcare information      leaflets. Two leaflets were developed and evaluated using questionnaires and      surveys, using a standard leaflet as the control. RESULTS/FINDINGS: All leaflets       increased awareness of the links between lifestyle and cancer and most of this      information was retained over a 2-week gap. Participants preferred the leaflet      that had a design that was radically different from standard leaflets.      CONCLUSIONS: Design guidelines for health information leaflets need to focus on      their usability (particularly attractiveness and effectiveness) as well as their       legibility and comprehensibility. The attractiveness and effectiveness can be      measured using simple usability surveys and awareness tests.

PMID- 22019280   - PURPOSE: Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for intensive      insulin therapy (IIT) are increasingly common. However, recent studies question      IIT's safety and mortality benefit. Researchers have identified factors      influencing IIT performance, but little is known about how workflow affects      computer-based IIT. We used ethnographic methods to evaluate IIT CDSS with      respect to other clinical information systems and care processes. METHODS: We      conducted direct observation of and unstructured interviews with nurses using IIT      CDSS in the surgical and trauma intensive care units at an academic medical      center. We observed 49h of intensive care unit workflow including 49 instances of      nurses using IIT CDSS embedded in a provider order entry system. Observations      focused on the interaction of people, process, and technology. By analyzing      qualitative field note data through an inductive approach, we identified barriers      and facilitators to IIT CDSS use. RESULTS: Barriers included (1) workload      tradeoffs between computer system use and direct patient care, especially related      to electronic nursing documentation, (2) lack of IIT CDSS protocol reminders, (3)      inaccurate user interface design assumptions, and (4) potential for error in      operating medical devices. Facilitators included (1) nurse trust in IIT CDSS      combined with clinical judgment, (2) nurse resilience, and (3) paper serving as      an intermediary between patient bedside and IIT CDSS. CONCLUSION: This analysis      revealed sociotechnical interactions affecting IIT CDSS that previous studies      have not addressed. These issues may influence protocol performance at other     institutions. Findings have implications for IIT CDSS user interface design and      alerts, and may contribute to nascent general CDSS theory.

PMID- 22018605   - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections (NIs) are among the important indicators used      for evaluating patients' safety and hospital performance during accreditation of       hospitals. NI rate is higher in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) than in the general      wards because patients require intense care involving both invasive and      non-invasive clinical procedures. The emergence of Superbugs is motivating health      providers to enhance infection control measures. Contact behavior between health       caregivers and patients is one of the main causes of cross infections. In this      technology driven era remote monitoring of patients and caregivers in the      hospital setting can be performed reliably, and thus is in demand. Proximity      sensing using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology can be helpful in       capturing and keeping track on all contact history between health caregivers and       patients for example. OBJECTIVES: This study intended to extend the use of      proximity sensing of radio frequency identification technology by proposing a      model for inferring RFID tag reader recordings into clinical events. The aims of       the study are twofold. The first aim is to set up a Contact History Inferential      Model (CHIM) between health caregivers and patients. The second is to verify CHIM      with real-time observation done at the ICU ward. METHOD: A pre-study was      conducted followed by two study phases. During the pre-study proximity sensing of      RFID was tested, and deployment of the RFID in the Clinical Skill Center in one      of the medical centers in Taiwan was done. We simulated clinical events and      developed CHIM using variables such as duration of time, frequency, and identity       (tag) numbers assigned to caregivers. All clinical proximity events are      classified into close-in events, contact events and invasive events. During the      first phase three observers were recruited to do real time recordings of all      clinical events in the Clinical Skill Center with the deployed automated RFID      interaction recording system. The observations were used to verify the CHIM      recordings. In second phase the first author conducted 40 h of participatory      observation in the ICU, and observed values that were used as golden standard to       validate CHIM. RESULTS: There were a total of 193 events to validate the CHIM in       the second phase. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of close-in events      were 73.8%, 83.8%, and 81.6%; contact events were 81.4%, 78.8%, and 80.7%; and      invasive events were 90.9%, 98.0%, and 97.5% respectively. CONCLUSION: The      results of the study indicated that proximity sensing of the RFID detects      proximity events effectively, and the CHIM can infer proximity events accurately.      RFID technology can be used for recording complete clinical contact history      between caregivers and patients thus assisting in tracing cause of NIs. Since      this model could infer the ICU activities accurately, we are convinced that the      CHIM can also be applied in other wards and can be used for additional purposes.

PMID- 22014811   - PURPOSE: To develop an authoritative list of IT management issues faced by CIOs      and IT directors in public hospitals. METHODS: The ranking-type Delphi method,      which elicits the opinion of a panel of experts through iterative controlled      feedback, was used in this study. Data collection involved three main steps      during which three panels of experts in Ontario (n=13 in rural hospitals; n=9 in       community hospitals; n=8 in academic hospitals) provided their input about the      key IT management issues in hospitals and their relative importance. Attrition      rate was minimal; 28 out of the 30 experts who participated in the study      completed all three phases of the survey. RESULTS: During the brainstorming      phase, the responses from the three panels were consolidated resulting in a list       of 36 IT management issues; eleven were overlapping between the three panels. In       the narrowing down phase, 18 issues were retained in the rural panel; 20 issues      in the community panel; and 17 issues in the academic panel. The top issues      retained in this phase included: managing demand and expectations for IT services      (76% of participants); having sufficient funds (69% of participants); recognizing      IT as a key stakeholder in major hospital decisions (65% of participants); and      implementation of an EMR (62% of participants). In the ranking phase, a moderate       level of consensus was obtained for all three panels: W=0.41 (rural panel);      W=0.54 (community panel); and W=0.43 (academic panel). Despite the differences in      the preoccupations between the three groups, there were similarities on certain      IT management issues. Besides having sufficient funds, three of the top IT      management issues relate to the strategic positioning of IT within the hospital:       managing demands and expectations for IT services; IT competing with other     clinical priorities for scarce resources; and recognizing IT as a key stakeholder     in major hospital decisions. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to      systematically and rigorously identify and prioritize critical IT management      issues in hospitals, which may be generalizable to similar environments in other       industrialized countries. The prioritized lists of IT management issues may be      used as a benchmark and diagnostic tool to support internal strategic decision      making related to IT. The broadening of understanding of the challenges faced by       IT executives in hospitals would support a more systematic evaluation of these      issues over time, and allow management, educational, and research resources to be      invested in the appropriate areas.

PMID- 22001067   - OBJECTIVE: The adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in      the health sector has often lagged behind adoption in other sectors as there are       a number of systemic inhibitors that make the adoption of ICT far more complex.      This paper aims to explore and investigate the drivers, facilitators and barriers      to electronic health records adoption in the health sector and provide some      guidance on how to improve the prospect of successful adoption. METHODS: A case      study of the successful development of electronic health records in remote      Western Australia is used to identify and highlight the drivers, facilitators and      barriers to electronic records adoption. A content analysis was undertaken on the      in-depth interviews with participants in the region to identify the key issues      and challenges and how they were overcome. RESULTS: The geographically isolated      nature of the region had a number of benefits since it meant the electronic      health records project was a manageable size and cost, the focus could be on      developing a workable system rather than a 'perfect solution', decisions could be      made autonomously without considering integration issues with other regions, the       transient nature of the patients was a key driver, the patient centred approach      elevated the importance of overcoming problems, and the system champions were      determined to make the system a workable success. CONCLUSIONS: Complex systemic      problems often derail ICT projects. The case study of an isolated region provides      a number of lessons and insights to improve electronic records adoption projects.      The limited resources and limited choices faced by the region lead to the      development of a number of key approaches that revolved around aiming for a      workable system rather than a high-end flawless solution. This ethos pervaded the      electronic health records project and was underpinned by a patient centred      approach and a strong desire to improve the service given to patients.

PMID- 22000677   - OBJECTIVES: This literature review identifies and categorises, from an      organisational management perspective, barriers to the use of HIT or ICT for     health. Based on the review, it offers policy interventions. METHODS: This      systematic literature review was carried out during December 2009 and January      2010. Additional on-going reviews of updates through automated system alerts took      place up until this paper was submitted. A total of thirty-one sources were      searched including nine software platforms/databases, fifteen specialised      websites/targeted databases, Google Scholar, ISI Science Citation Index and five       journals hand-searched. RESULTS: The study covers seventy-nine articles on      organisational barriers to ICT adoption by healthcare professionals. These are      categorised under five main headings - (I) Structure of healthcare organisations;      (II) Tasks; (III) People policies; (IV) Incentives; and (V) Information and      decision processes. A total of ten subcategories are also identified. By adopting      an organisational management approach, some recommendations to remove      organisational management barriers are made. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their apparent       promise, health information technologies (HIT) have proved difficult to      implement. This systematic review reveals the implementation barriers associated       to organisational management and their interrelations. Several important future      directions in the field are also suggested: (1) there is a need for further     research providing evidence of HIT cost-effectiveness as well as the development       of optimal HIT applications; (2) more information is needed regarding      organisational change, incentives, liability issues, end-users HIT competences      and skills, structure and work process issues involved in realising the benefits       from HIT. Future policy interventions should consider the five dimensions      identified when addressing the impact of HIT in healthcare organisational      systems, and how the impact of an intervention aimed at a particular dimension      would interrelate with others.

PMID- 21996624   - BACKGROUND: Introducing computers into primary care can have negative effects on       the doctor-patient dialogue. Little is known about such effects of mobile health       IT in point-of-care situations. AIM: To assess how different mobile information      devices used by physicians in point-of-care situations support or hinder aspects       of doctor-patient communication, such as face-to-face dialogue, nonverbal      communication, and action transparency. METHOD: The study draws on two different       experimental simulation studies where 22 doctors, in 80 simulated ward rounds,      accessed patient-related information from a paper chart, a PDA, and a laptop      mounted on a trolley. Video recordings from the simulations were analyzed      qualitatively. Interviews with clinicians and patients were used to triangulate      the findings and to verify the realism and results of the simulations. RESULT:      The paper chart afforded smooth re-establishment of eye contact, better verbal      and non-verbal contact, more gesturing, good visibility of actions, and quick      information retrieval. The digital information devices lacked many of these      affordances; physicians' actions were not visible for the patients, the user     interfaces required much attention, gesturing was harder, and re-establishment of      eye contact took more time. Physicians used the devices to display their actions       to the patients. The analysis revealed that the findings were related to the user     interface and form factor of the information devices, as well as the personal      characteristics of the physician. CONCLUSION: When information is needed and has       to be located at the point-of-care, the user interface and the physical form      factor of the mobile information device are influential elements for successful      collaboration between doctors and patients. Both elements need to be carefully      designed so that physicians can use the devices to support face-to-face dialogue,      nonverbal communication, and action visibility. The ability to facilitate and      support the doctor-patient collaboration is a noteworthy usability factor in the       design of mobile EPR systems. The paper also presents possible design guidelines       for mobile point-of-care systems for improved doctor-patient communication.

PMID- 21983222   - The design of an efficient and effective healthcare services is part of the      design for healthy living. Contemporary models of health rely on a deeper     involvement of the patient in the decision-making through the steps of the health      journey. In these methods, the quality of practitioner-patient interaction is      central to the successful processes and patient participation. The quality of      these interactions and the ability of both medical practitioners and patients to       reflect on each session is part of the design strategies for healthy living.      Interactions rely on extensive, effective and empowering communication between      practitioner and patient. The purpose of this work is to address the recognition       of this importance, evidenced from the broad and diverse communication training      for practitioners, by enabling the capture of information about the quality of      these interactions. Captured information has to be encoded in a way that enables       computer reasoning with it, as well as delivered to patients and practitioners in      ways that allow quick interpretation from respective sides. We present the      mechanics of the development of a visual language and analysis system enabling      visual reasoning about the quality of interactions. The visual knowledge      representation is designed based on aspects of human movement. Such design is      justified from the fact that human possess implicit knowledge about human      movement. The paper presents KIA (Kinetic Inter-Acting) encoding system that is      the foundation of the visual language and respective visual analysis method. KIA       enables both humans and machines to utilise information about how interactions      unfold, which is necessary for practitioner-patient interaction. The paper     concludes with discussion of KIA approach and technology in terms of the      implications for designing for healthy living.

PMID- 21963232   - Assisted Living provides a long-term care option that combines supportive systems      and services for monitoring and assessing the health status with activities of      daily living and health care. Daily monitoring of the health status in subjects      characterized by chronic and/or degenerative conditions is not possible in all      those cases where the disease progression has to be evaluated only by a direct      interaction between the patients and the healthcare structures on a regular     basis, over time and for life. In this respect, this work proposes an      evolutionary-fuzzy decision support system (DSS) for assessing the health status       of subjects affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) during the disease progression      over time. Such a DSS has been defined and implemented exploiting a novel      approach devised to facilitate the design of fuzzy DSSs for medical problems. The      approach is aimed at: (i) introducing a set of design criteria to encode the      medical knowledge elicited from clinical experts in terms of linguistic      variables, linguistic values and fuzzy rules with the final aim of granting the      interpretability; (ii) defining a fuzzy inference technique to best fit the      structure of medical knowledge and the peculiarities of the medical inference;      (iii) defining an evolutionary technique to tune the formalized knowledge by      optimizing the shapes of the membership functions for each linguistic variable      involved in the rules. An experimental session has been carried out for     evaluating, first of all, the approach on five medical databases commonly      diffused in literature and for comparing it with other systems. After that, the      evolutionary-fuzzy DSS for assessing MS patient's health status has been      quantitatively evaluated on 120 patients affected by MS and compared with other     approaches. The achieved results have shown that our approach is very effective      on the five databases, since it provides, on average, the second highest accuracy      when compared to eight tools. Furthermore, as far as the classification of      multiple sclerosis lesions is considered, the proposed system has turned out to      outperform nine popular tools.

PMID- 21963231   - PURPOSE: Various personal monitoring technologies have been introduced for     supporting regular physical activity, which is of critical importance in reducing      the risks of several chronic diseases. Recent studies suggest that combining      multiple modes of delivery, such as text messages and mobile monitoring devices      with web applications, holds potential for effectively supporting physical      exercise. Of particular interest is how the functionality and content of these      systems should be distributed across the different modes for successful outcomes.      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to: (a) investigate how users incorporate a      system employing two modes of delivery - a wearable heart rate monitor and a web       service - into their training and (b) to analyze benefits and limitations in      personal exercise monitoring and how they relate to the different modes in use.      METHODS: A qualitative field study employing diaries and semi-structured      interviews was carried out with 30 participants who used a heart rate monitoring       system comprising a wearable heart rate monitor, Polar FT60 and a web service,      Polar Personal Trainer for a period of 21 days. The data were systematically      analyzed to identify specific benefits and limitations associated with the system      characteristics and modes as perceived by the end-users. RESULTS: The benefits      include supporting exploratory learning, controlling target behavior, rectifying       behaviors, motivation and logging support. The limitations are associated with      information for validating the system, virtual coaching, task-technology fit,      data integrity and privacy concerns. Mobile interfaces enable exploratory      learning and controlling of target behaviors in situ, while web services can      effectively support users' need for cognition within the early stages of adoption      and long-term training with intelligent coaching functionality. CONCLUSIONS: This      study explains several benefits and limitations in personal exercise monitoring.       These can be addressed with crossmedial design, i.e., strategic distribution of      functionality and content across modes within the system. Our findings suggest      that personal exercise monitoring systems may be improved by more systematically       combining mobile and web-based functionality.

PMID- 21962435   - PURPOSE: There are few opportunities to study the use of integrated electronic      health record (EHR) systems, where single patient records are used by a number of      health care staff. The purpose of the study was to understand how an integrated      electronic health record system was used by health care staff in the treatment      and management of diabetes patients. The investigation was focused on the      interface between the primary and secondary care services which patients access      for their diabetes care. METHODS: Observations of the use of an integrated      electronic health record during patients' consultations with health care staff      were conducted over a three month period. Twelve patients were followed through      their consultations with a range of health care staff at a secondary care      Diabetes Centre and in primary care settings. A thematic analysis of the      observation data was undertaken. RESULTS: The integrated electronic health record      system had been implemented across the primary and secondary care interface and      was used by many, but not all, clinicians involved in the care of patients with      diabetes. In some areas of care it enabled health care staff to access more      accurate and detailed information to inform their clinical decision-making.      Issues including negotiating rules for accessing patient records and duplication       of recording in paper record systems had not been resolved consistently across      services. CONCLUSIONS: The findings offer suggestive evidence that a shared      electronic health record can support more integrated care. Unresolved issues in      implementing the system across all services and settings highlight the governance      problems that can arise when systems are developed locally but are then extended       across organisational and professional boundaries.

PMID- 21958551   - PURPOSE: The Internet is a promising tool for delivering health behavior change      programs although such interventions raise questions about participant engagement      in this medium. In this study we sought to determine the characteristics of      parents who engage in an Internet-based health intervention for their children      (with asthma) and to distinguish parents who engage at the prescribed intervals      versus those who engage less often. METHODS: N=283 parents with children who had       asthma were recruited and randomized to receive a web-based intervention.      Participants filled out six surveys over a 6-month period asking them about      demographic and clinical characteristics, outcome expectations and self-efficacy       beliefs regarding asthma control for their child, and attitudes about computers      and the Internet. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the population and      analyze associations. RESULTS: Controller use and being adherent to this      medication as well as positive outcome and self efficacy expectations were      associated with increased engagement. Parents who logged on only once reported      significantly less frequent use of the Internet than parents who logged on to all      sessions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that it is      important to find ways to increase engagement in a web-based intervention for     parents who are not yet engaging in the recommended behaviors and/or who report      less positive outcome and efficacy expectations around asthma management.

PMID- 21958550   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to improve understanding of      family caregivers' use of Web-based intervention support by integrating three      theoretical models. The study applied the Anderson's model of health service      utilization, Venkatesh's theory of technology acceptance, and Chatman's and      Wilson's information behavior theories. METHODS: This qualitative study is part      of a larger study. An interpretive grounded theory approach was used to conduct      in-depth interviews with Chinese caregivers of family members with dementia. The       caregivers received Internet-based information support and personalized e-mail      intervention. A purposive sample of fourteen caregivers was selected to      participate in the interviews. Constant comparison, analytic memoing, case      analysis, and concept mapping were used to conduct theoretical triangulation      analysis. RESULTS: Three main factors influenced the use of the intervention: (a)      caregiver needs, which are influenced by personal capacity, social support      available, and caregiving belief; (b) information communication technology (ICT)       factors, including accessibility barriers and perceived efforts to use the      technology; and (c) style of using the technology, such as preference for using      e-mail or the customized Website. The personal capacity of caregivers was      influenced by many factors, including computer and language proficiency, health      service knowledge, caregiving competence and competing roles and      responsibilities. Social support available for caregivers included available      computer, language or caregiving support and health service knowledge. Caregiving      belief included traditional belief of giving care, and health belief of the      illness. New caregivers needed a different kind of support intervention compared       with experienced caregivers. Caregivers with different amounts of experience      tended to have different learning styles, with new caregivers preferring      interactive intervention and more experienced caregivers preferring more      reflective learning. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforced the findings of the      larger quantitative study that it is important to address both care-giving needs       and technology factors in Internet-based intervention. The quantitative study      found that less competent caregivers with more positive attitudes towards      technology tended to use the intervention more frequently. In this qualitative      research, the findings revealed that caregiver needs, ICT factors, and style of      use explained the pattern of intervention use. This new conceptualization has      integrated information acceptance, health service utilization, and information      behavior theories. More studies will be needed to confirm if the proposed concept      can explain or predict the usage behavior in other Web-based interventions.

PMID- 21956004   - OBJECTIVE: To learn (1) about the kind of experiences that physicians have with      participation in healthcare IT development; (2) whether physicians are interested      in participating in IT development activities, and if so, how; and (3) the      visions that physicians have regarding future IT systems. METHODS: A web-based      questionnaire which was answered by about one-third of the working-age physicians      in Finland, which is exceptionally broad and sizeable a sample. This research      deals with only a small part of the entire questionnaire. The questions used for       this study were both quantitative and qualitative. Statistical methods were      applied to the former and content analysis to the latter. RESULTS: The responding      physicians were highly critical of their IT systems, and their experiences with      the current methods of participation, or rather the lack of it, were quite      negative. However, a very significant proportion of the respondents were willing       to contribute to IT systems development, contrary to a common assumption that      clinicians are disinterested. Visioning of future systems was quite cautious,      dealing mainly with usability improvements to the current systems. CONCLUSIONS:      Major improvements are needed both in the usability of the systems currently in      use in Finland and in the collaboration between end-users and developers.      Improved methods of participation need to be developed and applied, particularly       for the procurement, deployment and on-going development of      commercial-off-the-shelf applications.

PMID- 21956003   - OBJECTIVE: This paper is an exploratory study that investigates Singaporean      women's acceptance of using mobile phones to seek health information. METHOD: A      mobile web containing health topics was developed to track Singaporean women's      actual use of their mobile phones to seek health information. A survey      questionnaire measured variables hypothesized to predict Behavioural Intention.      The survey responses were then matched to the data collected on actual use.      Correlation analysis and hierarchical regression were used to analyze the data      collected. RESULTS: Findings revealed that Perceived Usefulness and Self-efficacy      positively predicted the intention to use mobile phones to seek health      information. The study also confirmed the presence of an intention-behaviour gap       among participants. The conversion of intention to actual behaviour hinges on      technical concerns and design factors. Prior experiences with health information       seeking reinforced women's evaluations of the usefulness of the mobile web      application and helped them to feel more self-efficacious about using their     mobile phones to seek health information. Using mobile phones to seek health      information was found to be complementary to online health information seeking      and can be regarded as an alternative source to the internet for seeking health      information. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the existing literature by      applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the context of mobile health      information seeking, for which there has been a lack of studies, and demonstrated      that the inclusion of additional variables can enhance TAM's predictive power.      The empirical presence of an intention-behaviour gap calls for future research to      investigate the reasons behind the gap. Finally, the findings from this study can      serve as input to promote women's use of mobile phones for better self-management      of health.

PMID- 21956002   - PURPOSE: To determine whether the introduction of an electronic nursing      documentation system in a nursing home reduces the proportion of time nursing      staff spend on documentation, and to use this information in evaluating the      usefulness of the system in improving the work of nursing staff. METHODS: An      observational work sampling study was conducted in 2009 and 2010, 2 months      before, and 3, 6 and 12 months after the introduction of an electronic nursing      documentation system. An observer (ENM) used a work classification tool to record      documentation activities being performed using paper and with a computer by      nursing staff at particular times for periods of 5 days. RESULTS: Three hundred      and eighty three (383) activities were recorded before implementation of the      electronic system, 472 activities at 3 months, 502 at 6 months, and 338 at 12      months after implementation. There was no significant difference between the      proportion of time nursing staff spent on documentation 2 months before and 3      months after the implementation of the electronic system. Six months after     implementation, the proportion of time on documentation increased significantly      and after 12 months, settled back to original levels that were recorded in the      paper-based system. Over half of the proportion of time on documentation at 6 and      12 months after implementation was spent on paper documentation tasks.      CONCLUSION: Introduction of an electronic nursing documentation system did not      reduce the proportion of time nursing staff spent on documentation. This may in      part have been a result of the practice of documenting some information items on       paper and others on a computer. To reduce the use of paper documentation or to      achieve a paper-free documentation environment in this setting, an in-depth      understanding of nursing staff's information needs, and documentation workflow is      necessary.

PMID- 21956001   - BACKGROUND: Information deficits contribute to medical errors. Hence several      efforts to develop electronic communication systems to facilitate a flow of      information between health care providers have been attempted, including      initiatives to develop regional or national electronic patient summaries.      OBJECTIVES: To study information access and information needs in inpatient      emergency departments, and how clinicians in these departments handle deficits in      available information. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of      consecutive unplanned inpatient admissions using a structured form to register a       set of predefined parameters and free-text notes, including a post-examination      interview with the examining emergency department doctors and nurses. RESULTS: We      observed 177 patient admissions, excluding any patients under 18 years of age and      planned admissions. One in four patients arrived without any referral. Nearly all      referrals described the presenting complaint with a tentative diagnosis. One      third of the referrals lacked medication record and medical history. Only one in       ten referrals contained information about contraindications. If the patient had      previously been admitted to the hospital, the emergency department doctors used      the existing electronic patient record and seemed to favor previous discharge      letters as an information source. Information on current medications was often      copied from earlier admissions. In half of the cases the patients also provided      supplementary information in other ways not available, though one in five      patients was not in a cognitive state to be properly interviewed. The examining      doctors reported a lack of crucial information in 10% of the observed referrals.       CONCLUSION: Overall, information about medications and previous history was      described in most referrals, but was still the information most frequently      inquired or searched for. Qualitative assessments revealed that insufficient      information put a significant stress on both patients and staff, and in turn      caused additional workload and risky work-arounds. In our assessment, these      information deficits could be effectively mitigated by an up to date easy-access       patient summary.

PMID- 21924671   - OBJECTIVE: Shift handover is seen as a key tool in ensuring continuity of care      yet a number of studies have highlighted the role of shift handovers in adverse      events. This, combined with the increased frequency of shift handovers, has led      to interest in providing technological support for handover to enhance safety.      The aim of this paper is to describe current practices for the conduct of shift      handovers and to use this as a basis for considering the role that technology      could play in supporting handover. METHODS: A multi-site case study of handover     was conducted. Data included observations of 15 medical shift handovers and 33      nursing shift handovers across three case sites. FINDINGS: The findings highlight      the way in which the verbal shift handover report is practically focused,      displaying the healthcare professional's ability to know what information is      required and where further explanation is needed. As well as supporting teaching       and team cohesion, shift handover can provide an opportunity to reflect on the      previous shift and for discussion with patients and their families. CONCLUSIONS:       The benefits provided by a face to face handover suggest that technology should      focus on supporting rather than replacing the verbal shift handover report,      providing a flexible solution that allows handover participants to gather more      information as it is required.

PMID- 21920810   - A usable medical information system should allow for reliable and accurate      interaction between users and the system in emergencies. A participatory design      approach was used to develop a medical information system in two Turkish      hospitals. The process consisted of task and user analysis, an icon design      survey, initial icon design, final icon design and evaluation, and installation      of the iconic medical information system with the icons. We observed work sites      to note working processes and tasks related to the information system and      interviewed medical personnel. Emergency personnel then participated in the      design process to develop a usable graphical user interface, by drawing icon      sketches for 23 selected tasks. Similar sketches were requested for specific      tasks such as family medical history, contact information, translation,      addiction, required inspections, requests and applications, and nurse      observations. The sketches were analyzed and redesigned into computer icons by      professional designers and the research team. A second group of physicians and      nurses then tested the understandability of the icons. The user interface layout       was examined and evaluated by system users, followed by the system's      installation. Medical personnel reported the participatory design process was      interesting and believed the resulting designs would be more familiar and      friendlier.

PMID- 21920809   - OBJECTIVE: Development of a good practice guideline to plan and perform      scientifically robust evaluation studies in health informatics. METHODS: Issues      to be addressed in evaluation studies were identified and guidance drafted based       on the evaluation literature and on experiences by key players. Successive drafts      of the guideline were discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of      experts during conferences and by e-mail. At a fairly early point the guideline      was put up for comments on the web. RESULTS: Sixty issues were identified that      are of potential relevance for planning, implementation and execution of an      evaluation study in the health informatics domain. These issues cover all phases       of an evaluation study: Preliminary outline, study design, operationalization of       methods, project planning, execution and completion of the evaluation study.      Issues of risk management and project control as well as reporting and      publication of the evaluation results are also addressed. CONCLUSION: A      comprehensive list of issues is presented as a guideline for good evaluation      practice in health informatics (GEP-HI). The strengths and weaknesses of the      guideline are discussed. Application of this guideline will support better     handling of an evaluation study, potentially leading to a higher quality of      evaluation studies. This guideline is an important step towards building stronger     evidence and thus to progress towards evidence-based health informatics.

PMID- 21920302   - PURPOSE: To assess provider acceptance of recommendations by a decision tool that      scans the electronic medical record and determines whether sodium phosphate may      be taken. In addition, to determine decision tool effects on a composite outcome       of colonoscopies canceled, rescheduled, aborted, or repeated sooner than      recommended due to preparation (prep) quality; prep quality; colonoscopy      duration; and patient satisfaction with and tolerance of the preparation.      METHODS: We used 4 alternating 4-week periods to compare the decision tool with      usual care for outpatient colonoscopy. All decision tool decisions were reviewed       in real-time by gastroenterology nurses and/or physicians. Patients completed a      survey about the prep process. Endoscopists blindly rated prep quality.      Colonoscopy duration and findings were recorded. RESULTS: Of 354 persons in the      decision tool group, 4 prep decisions were overridden because of patient      preference or prior prep failure, but none for medical reasons. Sodium phosphate       was used more frequently in the decision tool group (73% vs. 41%; P < 0.01).      There was no difference between the decision tool and usual care groups in the      composite outcome (26% vs. 30%, respectively; P = 0.29), acceptable prep quality       (62% vs. 56%; P = 0.22), colonoscopy duration (28 vs. 30 min; P = 0.17), patient       satisfaction (P = 0.38), or preparation tolerance (P = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: An      electronic medical record-based decision tool can safely and effectively tailor     the prep for colonoscopy and may improve colonoscopy efficiency and patient      satisfaction. LIMITATIONS: This study was performed at a single VA medical center     and endoscopy unit, relies on the presence of relevant medical conditions and      laboratory data in the electronic medical record, and had a higher than expected       use of sodium phosphate during usual care.

PMID- 21917512   - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a difficult-to-diagnose condition because of      its multiple clinical presentations and symptoms shared with other diseases.      Gold-standard diagnostic confirmation of suspected CD is achieved by biopsying      the small intestine. OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical decision-support system      (CDSS) integrated with an automated classifier to recognize CD cases, by      selecting from experimental models developed using intelligence artificial      techniques. METHODS: A web-based system was designed for constructing a      retrospective database that included 178 clinical cases for training. Tests were       run on 270 automated classifiers available in Weka 3.6.1 using five artificial      intelligence techniques, namely decision trees, Bayesian inference, k-nearest      neighbor algorithm, support vector machines and artificial neural networks. The      parameters evaluated were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the      ROC curve (AUC). AUC was used as a criterion for selecting the CDSS algorithm. A       testing database was constructed including 38 clinical CD cases for CDSS      evaluation. The diagnoses suggested by CDSS were compared with those made by      physicians during patient consultations. RESULTS: The most accurate method during      the training phase was the averaged one-dependence estimator (AODE) algorithm (a       Bayesian classifier), which showed accuracy 80.0%, sensitivity 0.78, specificity       0.80 and AUC 0.84. This classifier was integrated into the web-based      decision-support system. The gold-standard validation of CDSS achieved accuracy      of 84.2% and k=0.68 (p<0.0001) with good agreement. The same accuracy was      achieved in the comparison between the physician's diagnostic impression and the       gold standard k=0. 64 (p<0.0001). There was moderate agreement between the      physician's diagnostic impression and CDSS k=0.46 (p=0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: The      study results suggest that CDSS could be used to help in diagnosing CD, since the      algorithm tested achieved excellent accuracy in differentiating possible positive      from negative CD diagnoses. This study may contribute towards developing of a      computer-assisted environment to support CD diagnosis.

PMID- 21917511   - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates how neurologically disabled people's intention      to continue seeking and actual use of online health information are related to      various factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data      from people who have neurological disabilities. MEASUREMENTS: An online      questionnaire was used to measure demographic, physical, cognitive, and      behavioral factors based on subjects' self-reported data. RESULTS: Regression      analyses on 330 data show that a person's intention to continue online health      information seeking (OHIS) increases as perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use      (PEOU) and disability level increase. The OHIS intention is also predicted by a      negative interaction between PU and disability, a positive interaction between      PEOU and disability, and a negative interaction between PU and PEOU. It is also      find that a person's use of online health information is positively related to PU      and negatively related to perceived risk and the interaction between PU and risk.      LIMITATIONS: The sample was not randomly selected and the cross-sectional survey       cannot suggest causal relationships between variables. CONCLUSION: Neurologically      disabled people's online health information seeking and use can be predicted by      their cognitive perceptions. A heightened disability level increases an      individual's online health information seeking, but is not related to the use of       such information. Moreover, seeking more online health information does not make       an individual use more such information, suggesting that these two behaviors      should be carefully differentiated.

PMID- 21890403   - OBJECTIVE: To propose a research agenda that addresses technological and other     knowledge gaps in developing telemonitoring solutions for patients with chronic      diseases, with particular focus on detecting deterioration early enough to      intervene effectively. DESIGN: A mixed methods approach incorporating literature       review, key informant, and focus group interviews to gain an in-depth,      multidisciplinary understanding of current approaches, and a roadmapping process       to synthesise a research agenda. RESULTS: Counter to intuition, the research      agenda for early detection of deterioration in patients with chronic diseases is       not only primarily about advances in sensor technology but also much more about      the problems of clinical specification, translation, and interfacing. The      ultimate aim of telemonitoring is not fully agreed between the actors (patients,       clinicians, technologists, and service providers). This leads to unresolved      issues such as: (1) How are sensors used by patients as part of daily routines?      (2) What are the indicators of early deterioration and how might they be used to       trigger alerts? (3) How should alerts lead to appropriate levels of responses      across different agencies and sectors? CONCLUSION: Attempts to use telemonitoring      to improve the care of patients with chronic diseases over the last two decades      have so far failed to lead to systems that are embedded in routine clinical      practice. Attempts at implementation have paid insufficient attention to      understanding patient and clinical needs and the complex dynamics and      accountabilities that arise at the level of service models. A suggested way ahead      is to co-design technology and services collaboratively with all stakeholders.

PMID- 21862397   - PURPOSE: To better understand the environmental constraints on nurse managers      that impact their need for and use of decision support tools, we conducted a      Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA). A complete CWA includes system analyses at five      levels: work domain, decision-making procedures, decision-making strategies,      social organization/collaboration, and worker skill level. Here we describe the      results of the Work Domain Analysis (WDA) portion in detail then integrate the      WDA with other portions of the CWA, reported previously, to generate a more      complete picture of the nurse manager's work domain. METHODS: Data for the WDA      were obtained from semi-structured interviews with nurse managers, division      directors, CNOs, and other managers (n = 20) on 10 patient care units in three      Arizona hospitals. The WDA described the nurse manager's environment in terms of       the constraints it imposes on the nurse manager's ability to achieve targeted      outcomes through organizational goals and priorities, functions, processes, as      well as work objects and resources (e.g., people, equipment, technology, and      data). Constraints were identified and summarized through qualitative thematic      analysis. RESULTS: The results highlight the competing priorities, and external      and internal constraints that today's nurse managers must satisfy as they try to       improve quality and safety outcomes on their units. Nurse managers receive a      great deal of data, much in electronic format. Although dashboards were perceived      as helpful because they integrated some data elements, no decision support tools       were available to help nurse managers with planning or answering "what if"      questions. The results suggest both the need for additional decision support to      manage the growing complexity of the environment, and the constraints the      environment places on the design of that technology if it is to be effective.      Limitations of the study include the small homogeneous sample and the reliance on      interview data targeting safety and quality.

PMID- 21784701   - OBJECTIVE: In the health informatics field, usability studies typically focus on       evaluating a single information system and involve a rather small group of      end-users. However, little is known about the usability of clinical information      and communication technology (ICT) environment in which healthcare professionals       work daily. This paper aims at contributing to usability research and      user-oriented development of healthcare technologies with three objectives:      inform researchers and practitioners about the current state of usability of      clinical ICT systems, increase the understanding of usability aspects specific      for clinical context, and encourage a more holistic approach on studying      usability issues in health informatics field. METHODS: A national web      questionnaire study was conducted in Finland in spring 2010 with 3929 physicians       actively working in patient care. For the purposes of the study, we described      three dimensions of clinical ICT system usability that reflect the physicians'      viewpoint on system usage: (1) compatibility between clinical ICT systems and      physicians' tasks, (2) ICT support for information exchange, communication and      collaboration in clinical work, and (3) interoperability and reliability. The      dimensions derive from the definitions of usability and clinical context of use      analysis, and reflect the ability of ICT systems to have a positive impact on      patient care by supporting physicians in achieving their goals with a pleasant      user experience. The research data incorporated 32 statements with a five-point      Likert-scale on physicians' experiences on usability of their currently used ICT       systems and a summative question about school grade given to electronic health      record (EHR) systems. RESULTS: Physicians' estimates of their EHR systems were      very critical. With the rating scale from 4 or fail to 10 or excellent, the      average of the grades varied from 6.1 to 8.4 dependent on the kind of facility      the physician is working. Questionnaire results indicated several usability      problems and deficiencies which considerably hindered the efficiency of clinical       ICT use and physician's routine work. Systems lacked the appropriate features to       support typical clinical tasks, such as decision making, prevention of medical      errors, and review of a patient's treatment chart. The systems also required      physicians to perform fixed sequences of steps and tasks, and poorly supported      the documentation and retrieval of patient data. The findings on ICT support for       collaboration showed mainly negative results, aside from collaboration between      co-located physicians. In addition, the study results pointed out physicians      suffering from system failures and a lack of integration between the systems.      CONCLUSIONS: The described study and related results are unique in several ways.       A national usability study with nearly 4000 respondents had not been conducted in      other countries in which healthcare technologies are widely adopted. The      questionnaire study provided a generalized picture about the usability problems,       however, it should be noted that there were significant differences between      legacy systems in use. Previously, researchers had not approached contextual      aspects of usability the context of clinical work, where numerous systems are in       use. The described usability dimensions and the presented study results can be      considered as the first step towards conceptualizing ICT usability in the unique       setting of clinical work.

PMID- 21783409   - BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) have been shown to help      health care professionals to avoid errors and improve clinical practice and      efficiency in health care. Little is known about its influence on nursing      practice and outcomes for residents in nursing homes. AIM: The aim of this study       was to evaluate the effects on the risk for and prevalence of pressure ulcers      (PUs) and malnutrition of implementing a CDSS to improve prevention and care of      PUs and also to improve nutrition in the elderly in nursing homes. DESIGN SETTING      AND PARTICIPANTS: The study used a quasi-experimental design with two      intervention groups and one control group. A convenience sample of residents from      46 units in 15 nursing homes in rural areas in Norway was included. A total of      491 residents participated at baseline in 2007 and 480 residents at follow-up in       2009. METHODS: The intervention included educational sessions in prevention of      PUs and malnutrition for registered nurses (RNs) and nursing aides (NAs) in the      two intervention groups. In addition, one intervention group (intervention group       1) had a CDSS integrated into the electronic healthcare record (EHR) based on two      research-based risk assessment instruments: the Risk Assessment Pressure Scale      (RAPS) for PU risk screening and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA((R))) scale      for screening nutritional status. In each participating nursing home trained RNs       and NAs examined all residents who consented to participate on the RAPS and the      MNA((R)) scale. This examination included a skin assessment and details about PUs      were collected. RESULTS: The proportion of malnourished residents decreased      significantly in intervention group 1 between the two data collection periods      (2007 and 2009). No other significant effects of the CDSS on resident outcomes      based on the RAPS and MNA((R)) scores were found. CONCLUSION: CDSSs used by RNs      and NAs in nursing homes are still largely unexplored. A CDSS can be incorporated      into the EHR to increase the meaningful use of these computerized systems in      nursing home care. The effects of CDSS on healthcare provider workflow, clinical       decision making and communication about preventive measures in nursing home      practice still need further exploration. Based on results from our study,      recommendations would be to increase both sample size and the number of RNs and      NAs who participate in CDSS education programs.

PMID- 21783408   - BACKGROUND: In 2000, the Institute of Medicine reported disturbing numbers on the      scope it covers and the impact of medical error in the process of health      delivery. Nevertheless, a solution to this problem may lie on the adoption of      adverse event reporting and learning systems that can help to identify hazards      and risks. It is crucial to apply models to identify the adverse events root      causes, enhance the sharing of knowledge and experience. The efficiency of the      efforts to improve patient safety has been frustratingly slow. Some of this      insufficiency of progress may be assigned to the lack of systems that take into      account the characteristic of the information about the real world. In our daily       lives, we formulate most of our decisions normally based on incomplete, uncertain      and even forbidden or contradictory information. One's knowledge is less based on      exact facts and more on hypothesis, perceptions or indications. PURPOSE: From the      data collected on our adverse event treatment and learning system on medical      imaging, and through the use of Extended Logic Programming to knowledge      representation and reasoning, and the exploitation of new methodologies for     problem solving, namely those based on the perception of what is an agent and/or       multi-agent systems, we intend to generate reports that identify the most      relevant causes of error and define improvement strategies, concluding about the       impact, place of occurrence, form or type of event recorded in the healthcare      institutions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Eindhoven Classification Model was      extended and adapted to the medical imaging field and used to classify adverse      events root causes. Extended Logic Programming was used for knowledge      representation with defective information, allowing for the modelling of the      universe of discourse in terms of data and knowledge default. A systematization      of the evolution of the body of knowledge about Quality of Information embedded      in the Root Cause Analysis was accomplished. An adverse event reporting and      learning system was developed based on the presented approach to medical errors      in imaging. This system was deployed in two Portuguese healthcare institutions,      with an appealing outcome. The system enabled to verify that the majority of      occurrences were concentrated in a few events that could be avoided. The      developed system allowed automatic knowledge extraction, enabling report      generation with strategies for the improvement of quality-of-care.

PMID- 21782503   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to learn about factors that influence the       design and implementation of situated computing solutions that support hospital      work. This includes social and technical aspects of the actual systems that will       be implemented, as well as the appropriate design methodology for developing      these systems. METHODS: Staff at a surgical department at a University hospital      were engaged in a participatory design (PD) process to help solve a problem that       was presented by the staff: scheduling of patients and surgery rooms, and      creating awareness of the status of ongoing surgeries. The PD process was      conceptually aided by a model that describes Medical Informatics Systems as      comprising of three components, a service component, a technical component and a       social component. The process included the use of ethnographic field work and      iterative redesign of both technical and social components of the system after it      had been implemented into day-to-day work practice. RESULTS: The PD process      resulted in the creation of a system that was iteratively created over a period      of about 2 years, and which then handed over to the IT department of the hospital      and used by the surgical department for a period of about 1 additional year. The       first version of the prototype that was implemented contained usability flaws      that made the system difficult to use in time critical situations. As a result of      observations and a redesign of the technical component and social component of      the system a new version was possible to implement that managed to overcome this       problem. A key feature of this second version of the system was that some      responsibility for data entry validation was shifted from the technical component      of the system to the social component of the system. This was done by allowing      users to input poor data initially, while requiring them to fix this data later     on. This solution breaks from "traditional" usability design but proved to be      quite successful in this case. A challenge with the solution, however, was that      the IT department could not understand the concept of systems being described as       comprising of both social components and technical components, and thus they had       difficulty in understanding the overall design of the system during the handover       process. CONCLUSIONS: Situated computing can present a number of design      challenges that may not be easy for designers and hospital workers to understand       before a system has been implemented. Situated computing development may thus      need to be aided by PD that includes both ethnographic observations and iterative      redesign of the system after it has been implemented. Traditional data validation      mechanisms may create poor system performance in cases where users are rushed to       input data into the computer due to pressures created by other more critical work      activities. In this case it may be better to rely on social mechanisms for     correcting errors later on, rather than error catching mechanisms that reject      incorrect data. It can be challenging, however, to maintain such systems over     time, as IT-departments may lack skills and interest in social components.

PMID- 21778104   - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy drugs are intended for the treatment of cancer. The      production of such drugs and their administration to the patient is a delicate      and expensive operation. The study deals with the acquisition and processing of      data regarding the production of intravenous chemotherapy, from the production      request (the medical prescription), the production itself (pharmaceutical      process), to the delivery in the health care unit, for the administration of the       chemotherapy. The goal of this study is to develop a system that can schedule,      control and track the chemotherapy preparations and satisfy a certification      process of quality management ("ISO 9001 version 2000" standard). METHODS: The      solution proposed in this paper was developed within the framework of a common      certification process at the Biopharmaceutical Unit of the Oncology Clinic (UBCO)      of the Bretonneau hospital in Tours (France). The system consists of two software      programs: a software to insure traceability and a decision making software to      plan the production. To simplify the data entry process, some mobile entry points      with bar code reader have been deployed. These tools enable an accurate tracking       of the production, a security and control for the schedule production phases, and      a full traceability of each operation leading to the administration of the      chemotherapy drug. RESULTS: The first result is a software that creates the      production schedule, allows a real time control of the production process and a      full traceability of each step. Computational experiments are based on real data       sets, with a comparison of a time period before and after the implementation of      this solution. The results show the positive impacts of this software, like the      reduction of delayed deliveries, real time generation of production indicators,      optimization of the production and a saving of staff time. CONCLUSIONS: This      intuitive system guarantees a traceability in connection with a high quality      system certified ISO 9001-v2000 (with a rapid data entry), an assistant to      schedule the production of preparations in a better way, a permanent follow-up      and analysis of operations. This project proves the benefits of implementing      computer solutions for the traceability and assistance in decision making in the       hospital systems.

PMID- 21775198   - INTRODUCTION: The interoperability of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) between      heterogeneous systems has been facilitated by not one, but a number of predefined      open storage formats. To improve the techniques currently used, it is important      to define the similarities and the differences between these ECG storage formats.      METHODS: This paper presents a review of 9 formats used to store the ECG. Three      of the predominant formats, namely, SCP-ECG, DICOM-ECG, and HL7 aECG are reviewed      in detail along with the undertaking of a SWOT analysis. The remaining formats      have been examined to a lesser extent as they are not as predominant in the      literature. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that a plethora of open ECG formats,       all aiming to promote interoperability has the opposite effect of adding more      complexity. This paper discusses whether a format supporting a variety of      diagnostic modalities is more advantageous than a format that only supports the      ECG. It is conclusive that a general purpose format such as DICOM solves more      interoperability issues, however, no general purpose format currently exists that      fulfils the requirements of all users. As a result, the healthcare industry has      been bombarded with custom storage formats, i.e., a format for storing the      resting ECG, a format for storing the ambulatory ECG, a format for storing the      ECG in clinical trials, a format for storing ECG data on mobile devices etc. This      study then examines which implementation method is more suited to encode ECG      data, i.e. binary or XML. Binary encoding has been used in the past to store the       ECG, however, unlike binary, XML files are human readable, searchable and provide      a better form of semantics. Based on analysis within this work it is speculated      that XML may overtake binary as the preferred implementation method for encoding       ECG data since it has already made a huge impact in the healthcare industry.      CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is a wide range of vastly different      techniques used to store the ECG. Although the specifications of these formats      are openly available, neither has been internationally adopted to be used with      all ECG machines. Therefore, there remains a lack of global interoperability of      ECG information.

PMID- 21763190   - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper were to study the reporting rate and      completeness of data reported from primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Sweden      to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), with a special attention on the       relation between these measures and the reporting system used by the PHCCs.      METHOD: A national survey conducted in Swedish primary healthcare covering the      year 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 523 PHCCs. Data on      87,099 adult diabetic patients attending these PHCCs and reported to the NDR were      obtained from the register. In Sweden, participation in the NDR is voluntary. The      data were reported through the Internet, either online using a web-based system      or by direct transmission. The main outcome measures were reporting rate and      completeness of reported data. RESULTS: Of the 523 PHCCs, almost two-thirds had      reported <75% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. The lowest reporting rate      was found among the largest PHCCs, while the highest was found among small PHCCs       (p<0.001). Reasons given for not reporting data to the NDR were lack of time and       lack of personnel resources. Altogether, 73.1% of the PHCCs reported data to the       NDR online using a web-based system, 20.5% used direct transmission and 6.3% used      both systems. The PHCCs that reported data through direct transmission systems      reported almost 70% of their diabetic patients to the NDR, while PHCCs using      web-based systems reported 54% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. Adjusted      for other factors, using direct transmission increased the reporting rate by 13.0      percentage points. However, the web-based system contributed to a higher     completeness of data than the direct transmission system. CONCLUSIONS: A direct      transmission system facilitates a high reporting rate to the register at the      expense of lower completeness of the reported data.

PMID- 21763189   - PURPOSE: Many emergency departments (EDs) are in a process of transitioning from       dry-erase to electronic whiteboards. This study investigates differences in ED      clinicians' perception and assessment of their electronic whiteboards across      departments and staff groups and at two points in time. METHOD: We conducted a      survey consisting of a questionnaire administered when electronic whiteboards      were introduced and another questionnaire administered when they had been in use       for 8-9 months. The survey involved two EDs and, for reasons of comparison, a      paediatric department. RESULTS: The ED respondents consider the whiteboard      information important to their overview, and they approve of the introduction of       electronic whiteboards. With the electronic whiteboards, the ED respondents      experience a better overall overview of their work than with dry-erase      whiteboards. They also experience that whiteboard information has to a larger     extent become available where and when they need it. Conversely, the ED      respondents' expectations toward the electronic whiteboards have not been      fulfilled when it comes to keeping information current and obtaining improvements      for the patients. The ED staff groups of physicians, nurses, and secretaries      experience the electronic whiteboards differently. The physicians, for example,      consider it faster and simpler than the nurses to find information on the      electronic whiteboards. After extended use, multiple questionnaire items about      achieved performance and required effort contribute to explaining the variation      in the nurses' overall assessment of the whiteboards; for physicians and      secretaries few items contribute to explaining the variation in their overall      assessment. The respondents from the paediatric department perceive their     whiteboards as less important to their overview and collaboration than the ED      respondents. CONCLUSION: The ED clinicians experience positive effects of      electronic over dry-erase whiteboards. However, their assessment of electronic      whiteboards depends on their staff group, evolves over time, and differs from      that of paediatric clinicians. These results likely affect clinicians' acceptance      of electronic whiteboards and their command of their work.

PMID- 21757400   - BACKGROUND: The provision of relevant clinical information on pathology requests       is an important part of facilitating appropriate laboratory utilization and      accurate results interpretation and reporting. PURPOSE: (1) To determine the      quantity and importance of handwritten clinical information provided by      physicians to the Microbiology Department of a hospital pathology service; and      (2) to examine the impact of a Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system on      the nature of clinical information communication to the laboratory. METHODS: A      multi-method and multi-stage investigation which included: (a) a retrospective      audit of all handwritten Microbiology requests received over a 1-month period in       the Microbiology Department of a large metropolitan teaching hospital; (b) the      administration of a survey to laboratory professionals to investigate the impact       of different clinical information on the processing and/or interpretation of      tests; (c) an expert panel consisting of medical staff and senior scientists to      assess the survey findings and their impact on pathology practice and patient      care; and (d) a comparison of the provision and value of clinical information      before CPOE, and across 3 years after its implementation. RESULTS: The audit of      handwritten requests found that 43% (n=4215) contained patient-related clinical      information. The laboratory survey showed that 97% (84/86) of the different types      of clinical information provided for wound specimens and 86% (43/50) for stool      specimens were shown to have an effect on the processing or interpretation of the      specimens by one or more laboratory professionals. The evaluation of the impact      of CPOE revealed a significant improvement in the provision of useful clinical      information from 2005 to 2008, rising from 90.1% (n=749) to 99.8% (n=915)      (p<.0001) for wound specimens and 34% (n=129) to 86% (n=422) (p<.0001) for stool       specimens. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the CPOE system provided an      integrated platform to access and exchange valuable patient-related information      between physicians and the laboratory. These findings have important implications      for helping to inform decisions about the design and structure of CPOE screens      and what data entry fields should be designated or made voluntary.

PMID- 21724456   - PURPOSE: The authors identified the need for a cross-disciplinary research view      of issues to ensure an integrated citizen-centric support to achieve optimal      health of individual citizens and, in particular, the role of informatics to      inform and coordinate support towards integrated and holistic care. METHOD: An      Exploratory Workshop was approved and sponsored by the European Science      Foundation. Twenty-three participants from 15 countries attended, covering a full      range of health, social care and informatics professions and disciplines.      RESULTS: The participants found strong common ground in identifying key issues to      be addressed if citizens with compromised health are to receive integrated and      coordinated support to a common set of objectives, while also ensuring      appropriate choice and support for citizen, family and other informal carers. At       the same time, optimal health was identified as a fundamental human right, and      that achieving this is a necessary priority of a caring society. Moreover, Europe      has a commitment to researching and developing health informatics (e-health),      though not yet giving a priority to this integration of health and social care.      Specifically the following main informatics challenges to be addressed were      identified: (1) to identify available information and communication needs related      to different scenarios of use in the intersection between health and social care,      (2) to develop and map shared ontologies, and standards for integration and/or     brokerage, (3) to enable planned information access and sharing, shaping a system      of trust where the patient is an active partner and policies are established      considering all partners/interests, (4) to investigate the use of      automatic/intelligent knowledge based and context-relevant services, and (5)      empowering the citizen (or their selected agent) as co-producer through modern      informatics tools, while carefully avoiding selective disempowerment of the most       vulnerable. CONCLUSION: The Exploratory Workshop resulted in a unanimous      Declaration for action, which is presented appended to this paper.

PMID- 21680236   - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and evaluate the newly issued Electronic Health Record      (EHR) Architecture and Data Standard of China (Chinese EHR Standard) and identify      areas of improvement for future revisions. DESIGN: We compared the Chinese EHR     Standard with the standard of the American Society for Testing and Materials      Standard Practice for Content and Structure of Electronic Health Records in the      United States (ASTM E 1384 Standard). METHODS: The comparison comprised two      steps: (1) comparing the conformance of the two standards to the international      standard: Health Informatics-Requirements for an Electronic Health Record      Architecture (ISO/TS 18308), and showing how the architectures of the two      standards satisfy or deviate from the ISO requirements and (2) comparing the      detailed data structures between the two standards. RESULTS: Of the 124      requirement items in ISO/TS 18308, the Chinese EHR Standard and the ASTM E 1384      Standard conformed to 77 (62.1%) and 111 (89.5%), respectively. The Chinese EHR     Standard conformed to 34 of 50 Structure requirements (68.0%), 22 of 24 Process      requirements (91.7%), and 21 of 50 Other requirements (42.0%). The ASTM E 1384      Standard conformed to 49 of 50 Structure requirements (98.0%), 23 of 24 Process      requirements (95.8%), and 39 of 40 Other requirements (78.0%). CONCLUSIONS:      Further development of the Chinese EHR Standard should focus on supporting      privacy and security mechanism, diverse data types, more generic and extensible      lower level data structures, and relational attributes for data elements.

PMID- 21676650   - PURPOSE: To develop, implement and test a novel audience response system (ARS)      that allows image based interaction for radiology education. METHODS: The ARS      developed in this project is based on standard Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)      (HP iPAQ 114 classic handheld) running Microsoft(R) Windows Mobile(R) 6 Classic      with a large 3.5 in. TFT touch screen (320x240 pixel resolution), high luminance       and integrated IEEE 802.11b/g wireless. For software development Visual Studio      2008 professional (Microsoft) was used and all components were written in C#. Two      test sessions were conducted to test the software technically followed by two      real classroom tests in a radiology class for medical students on thoracic      radiology. RESULTS: The novel ARS, called I2Vote, was successfully implemented      and provided an easy to use, stable setup. The acceptance of both students and      teachers was very high and the interaction with the students improved because of       the anonymous interaction possibility. CONCLUSION: An easy to use handheld based       ARS that enables interactive, image-based, teaching is achieved. The system      effectively adds an extra dimension to the use of an ARS.

PMID- 21640643   - PURPOSE: Research over the past decade has conveyed a dramatic rise in health      information seeking via the Internet and articulated various profiles and      outcomes of health information seeking. In building upon this research, the      current study is innovative in considering predictors of health information      seeking by medium, as well as outcomes of health information seeking by medium      and by critical demographics. METHODS: OLS regression and logistic regression are      conducted on data from a telephone survey of American adults in 2007 (N=700).      RESULTS: Profiles of health information seekers vary dramatically by medium      (Internet versus newspapers versus television). In terms of outcomes, newspaper     health information seeking is associated with fruit and vegetable consumption,      while television health information seeking is associated with sweetened soft      drink consumption. There are four significant interaction terms between these two      health information seeking variables and unhealthy snack consumption. Internet      health information seeking has no significant effects. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison      to the Internet, newspaper and television media have more favorable associations       with recommended levels of lifestyle behaviors that may be critical in efforts to      decrease obesity in the United States.

PMID- 21622022   - PURPOSE: Handheld computers have potential to improve HIV/AIDS programs in      healthcare settings in low-resource countries, by improving the speed and      accuracy of collecting data. However, the acceptability of the technology (i.e.,       user attitude and reaction) is critical for its successful implementation.      Acceptability is particularly critical for HIV/AIDS behavioral data, as it      depends on respondents giving accurate information about a highly sensitive topic      - sexual behavior. METHODS: To explore the acceptability of handheld computers      for HIV/AIDS data collection and to identify potential barriers to acceptance,      five focus groups of 8-10 participants each were conducted in Luanda, Angola.      Facilitators presented Palm Tungsten E handhelds to the focus groups, probed      participants' perceptions of the handheld computer, and asked how they felt about      disclosing intimate sexual behavior to an interviewer using a handheld computer.       Discussions were conducted in Portuguese, the official language of Angola, and      audio-taped. They were then transcribed and translated into English for analysis.      RESULTS: In total, 49 people participated in the focus groups. PDAs were      understood through the lens of social and cultural beliefs. Themes that emerged      were suspicion of outsiders, concern with longevity, views on progress and      development, and concern about social status. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this      study suggest that personal and cultural beliefs influence participant acceptance      of PDAs in Angola. While PDAs provide great advantages in terms of speed and      efficiency of data collection, these barriers, if left unaddressed, may lead to      biased reporting of HIV/AIDS risk data. An understanding of the barriers and why       they are relevant in Angola may help researchers and practitioners to reduce the       impact of these barriers on HIV/AIDS data collection.

PMID- 21621453   - OBJECTIVE: Clinical event monitors are a type of active medication monitoring      system that can use signals to alert clinicians to possible adverse drug      reactions. The primary goal was to evaluate the positive predictive values of      select signals used to automate the detection of ADRs in the medical intensive      care unit. METHOD: This is a prospective, case series of adult patients in the      medical intensive care unit during a six-week period who had one of five signals       presents: an elevated blood urea nitrogen, vancomycin, or quinidine      concentration, or a low sodium or glucose concentration. Alerts were assessed      using 3 objective published adverse drug reaction determination instruments. An      event was considered an adverse drug reaction when 2 out of 3 instruments had      agreement of possible, probable or definite. Positive predictive values were      calculated as the proportion of alerts that occurred, divided by the number of      times that alerts occurred and adverse drug reactions were confirmed. RESULTS:      145 patients were eligible for evaluation. For the 48 patients (50% male) having       an alert, the mean+/-SD age was 62+/-19 years. A total of 253 alerts were      generated. Positive predictive values were 1.0, 0.55, 0.38 and 0.33 for     vancomycin, glucose, sodium, and blood urea nitrogen, respectively. A quinidine      alert was not generated during the evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized clinical      event monitoring systems should be considered when developing methods to detect      adverse drug reactions as part of intensive care unit patient safety surveillance      systems, since they can automate the detection of these events using signals that      have good performance characteristics by processing commonly available laboratory      and medication information.

PMID- 21600842   - BACKGROUND: Inadequate hand hygiene (HH) by healthcare staff results in increased      rates of hospital acquired infections in healthcare institutions, considerable      waste of resources, and negative economic impact for the healthcare system.      Toronto Rehabilitation Institute has developed an automated HH monitoring system       that detects HH opportunities, generates HH reminding signals when it is      necessary and enables hospital management to monitor individual and aggregated HH      performance on ongoing basis. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that HH improvement is      feasible with the proposed technical solution and that technology is acceptable      by potential users. METHODS: The technology was installed in four rooms on a      nursing unit of a larger complex continuous care hospital. The rooms were      selected to make it possible to automatically follow the same nurses for the      duration of their entire shift. Eleven nurses were provided with the wearable      electronic HH monitors as well as with the instrumented personal wearable alcohol      gel dispensers. Stationary gel dispensers installed in the unit were also      instrumented with technology. RESULTS: Over 145 h of testing the system      automatically recorded a total of 1438 events of entering and leaving monitored      rooms and indicated an average of 6.42 HH actions per hour. The baseline      observational study indicated 4.2 HH actions per hour. Approximately half of the       HH actions recorded by the system were performed using personal wearable alcohol       gel dispensers. CONCLUSION: The results obtained when testing the embedded HH      monitoring system demonstrated the feasibility of HH improvement and proved that       proposed solution merits a larger and longer clinical trial to measure the degree      of improvement and the sustainability of that improvement.

PMID- 21570901   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine nurses' attitudes and      reflection on the transformation of their workpractices after the implementation       of an Emergency Department Information System (EDIS). METHODS: A qualitative      study using interviews, mainly with nurses, conducted four years after the      implementation of an EDIS at the emergency department (ED) of a large university       hospital in Midlands, UK. RESULTS: The introduction of waiting time targets for     patients attending EDs and the spatial expansion of these clinical settings so as      to support increasing numbers of attendances challenged the viability of paper     records and whiteboards in the management of patient flows within the department.      They also fostered the use of an information system for accumulating information       and coordinating the activities of the multidisciplinary team. While whiteboards       were abolished, paper still plays a role in nursing practice in response to      issues of confidentiality, personal safety, ergonomics, computer literacy,      interoperability, relationship with patients and overdependence on EDIS.      CONCLUSIONS: ED information systems can have a major impact on organisational      practices particularly as new service models of care are gradually introduced in       EDs. Considering their spatio-temporal implications while treating the technology      as an artifact with transformative, rather than supportive or substitutive, power     enhances our understanding of the implementation challenges that need to be      addressed during the reshaping of the sociotechnical network.

PMID- 21555237   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the problems experienced after implementing a computerized      physician order entry (CPOE) system, their possible root causes, and the      responses of providers in order to incorporate the system into daily workflow.      METHODS: A qualitative study in the medication-use process after implementation      of a CPOE system in an academic hospital in The Netherlands. Data included 21      interviews with clinical end-users, paper-based and system-generated documents      used daily in the process, and educational materials used to train users.      FINDINGS: The problems in the medication-use process included cognitive overload       on physicians and nurses, unmet information needs, miscommunication of orders and      ideas, problematic coordination of interrelated tasks between co-working      professionals, a potentially faulty administration phase, and suboptimal      monitoring of the medication plans. These problems were mainly rooted in the lack      of mobile computer devices, the uneasy integration of coexisting electronic and      paper-based systems, suboptimal usability of the system, and certain      organizational factors with regard to procuring drugs affecting the technology      use. Various types of workarounds were used to address the difficulties,      including phone calls, taking multiple paper notes, issuing paper-based and      verbal orders, double-checking, using other patients' procured drugs or another     department's drug supply, and modifying and annotating the printed orders.      CONCLUSION: This study shows how providers are actively involved in working      around the interruptions in workflow by bypassing the technology or adapting the       work processes. Although certain workarounds help to maintain smooth workflow      and/or to ensure patient safety, others may burden providers by necessitating      extra time and effort and/or endangering patient safety. It is important that      workarounds having a negative nature are recognized and discussed in order to      find solutions to mitigate their effects.

PMID- 21536492   - PURPOSE: We used ORA, a dynamic network analysis tool, to identify patient care      unit communication patterns associated with patient safety and quality outcomes.       Although ORA had previously had limited use in healthcare, we felt it could      effectively model communication on patient care units. METHODS: Using a survey      methodology, we collected communication network data from nursing staff on seven       patient care units on two different days. Patient outcome data were collected via      a separate survey. Results of the staff survey were used to represent the      communication networks for each unit in ORA. We then used ORA's analysis      capability to generate communication metrics for each unit. ORA's visualization      capability was used to better understand the metrics. RESULTS: We identified      communication patterns that correlated with two safety (falls and medication      errors) and three quality (e.g., symptom management, complex self care, and      patient satisfaction) outcome measures. Communication patterns differed      substantially by shift. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the utility of ORA      for healthcare research and the relationship of nursing unit communication      patterns to patient safety and quality outcomes.

PMID- 21530383   - OBJECTIVE: The consultation request process between primary care and specialty      services often contains paper-based components that may be inefficient and      difficult to track. Other barriers may include workarounds and communication      breakdowns with the potential to adversely impact delivery of quality medical      care. We investigated current challenges to the electronic outpatient consult      management process in the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA).      DESIGN: We conducted ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews in      nine different specialty clinics and three primary care clinics in a large,      tertiary Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). We also performed a      national-level query of 'electronic error and enhancement requests' (E3Rs)      related to the consult package in the VA's electronic health record (EHR)      submitted over a 5-year period (2005-2009). MEASUREMENTS: Two researchers      recorded the observable interactions and interview responses of 16 healthcare      workers related to their work with consultations. Two separate coding schemes      were applied to both the observational and the interview data. E3Rs from the      national query were reviewed and categorized based on the nature of the      enhancement requests. RESULTS: We identified several examples of paper     persistence, as well as workarounds, communication breakdowns, and redundancies      in computerized consult management. An analysis of enhancement requests for the      consults also revealed three broad needs related to reporting, configuration or     customization, and user interface enhancements. CONCLUSION: Understanding these      challenges to the current consult management process is important to help design       enhanced informatics tools integrated into workflow to support coordination of      care and tracking of consults requests.

PMID- 21530381   - PURPOSE: To examine how psychosocial variables predicted use of an online health       consultation service among low-income breast cancer patients and in turn how      using this service affected these same psychosocial outcomes. METHOD: This      retrospective study included 231 recently diagnosed, low-income (at or below 250%      of the federal poverty level) breast cancer patients provided a free computer     with 16 weeks of access to the Internet-based 'Ask an Expert' service offered as       part of the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) "Living with       Breast Cancer" program. The use activity included a total of 502 messages      submitted to the online health consultation service. The data included five      psychosocial variables: information seeking, social support, health self      efficacy, participation in health care, and doctor-patient relationship, were      collected at both the pre-test and 16-week post-test after using the service.      Correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationship between pre- and      post-test, and use activity. A multiple regression model was formed for each of      five psychosocial variables to examine how use activity of the consultation      service was associated with various psychosocial measurements. RESULTS: In total,      865 distinct consulting queries from 502 messages were identified as measurement       of patients' use activities (3.74 consulting queries per participant). Use      activity had significant negative relationships with pre-test scores across all      five psychosocial variables. The regression models found significant positive      main effects (use activity) associated with three of these psychosocial      variables: health self efficacy, participation in health care and doctor-patient       relationship. Use activity of the online consultation service did not have      significant relationships with the dependent variables of information seeking and      perceived social support. CONCLUSION: Low-income breast cancer patients sought      out information from an online cancer information expert. Patients with more      negative perceptions at pre-test tended to use the service more. Greater use of      the service was associated with improvement in patients' perception of health      self-efficacy, participation in health care and doctor-patient relationship.      Moreover, use of online health consultation appears to level the differences,      narrowing the gaps between those who were worse and better off at pre-test. These      findings suggest that online health consultation can serve as an effective      complement to other resources, which help low-income, breast cancer patients feel      more confident to participate more actively in their health care, become more      actively involved in making decisions about their treatments and enhance the      relationship with their doctors.

PMID- 21514880   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity of using electronic medical records (EMR)       database in a large health organization for identifying patients with clinical      depression. METHOD: The Massachusetts General Hospital EMR system was used to      generate a sample of primary care patients seen in the primary care clinic in      2007. Using this sample, the validity of using certain fields in the EMR database      (i.e., billing diagnosis, problem list, and medication list) to identify patients      with clinical depression was compared to primary care physician (PCP) assessment       by a written questionnaire. Based on this standard, the sensitivity, specificity,      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the areas under     receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of three specific EMR fields -      individually and in combination - were calculated to identify which EMR field      best predicted PCP classification. RESULTS: The EMR fields "billing diagnosis",      "problem list" and antidepressant in "medication list", were all able to identify      patients' diagnosis of depression by their PCPs reasonably well. Having one or     more "billing diagnosis" of depression had the highest sensitivity and highest      AUC (77% sensitivity, 76% specificity, AUC 0.77) among any of the fields used      alone. CONCLUSION: The AUC for "billing diagnosis" of depression performed the      best of the three single fields tested, with an AUC of 0.77, corresponding to a      test with moderate accuracy. This analysis demonstrates that specific EMR fields       can be used as a proxy for PCP assessment of depression for this EMR system.      Limitations to our analysis include the physician response rate to our survey as       well as the quality of the data, which is collected primarily for administrative       and clinical purposes. When using administrative and clinical data in mental      health studies, researchers must first assess the accuracy of choosing specific      fields within their EMR system in order to determine the level of accuracy for     them to be used as proxies for clinical diagnoses.

PMID- 21511520   - OBJECTIVE: Understanding how physicians navigate through patient data to      construct clinically meaningful information has implication for resident      education as well as how patient data is displayed. The purpose of this study was      to determine how physicians reason through patient data presented on a flowsheet       in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: A volunteer sample of 20      neonatologists took part in this study. Participants evaluated 5 hypothetical      case scenarios presented on standardized NICU flowsheets to (1) select the best      diagnosis for each case (diagnostic choice) and (2) identify the flowsheet items       that most influenced their diagnostic choice (diagnostic reasoning). RESULTS:      Faculty had generally high agreement with respect to their diagnostic choices.      There was little agreement on items that faculty considered clinically relevant      for each case. On average, only 6% of items per case reached an agreement level      of at least 75%. CONCLUSIONS: We found that neonatologists who agreed on a      diagnosis rarely agreed on the most important data elements that led them to that      conclusion. Future studies designed to articulate how physicians decide to direct      their attention when presented with flowsheet data may shed light on how this      data is utilized and might be optimally presented.

PMID- 21501969   - OBJECTIVE: STATPack is an information system used to aid in the diagnosis of      pathogens in hospitals and state public health laboratories. STATPack is used as       a communication and telemedicine diagnosis tool during emergencies. This paper     explores the success of this emergency response medical information system      (ERMIS) using a well-known framework of information systems success developed by       DeLone and McLean. METHOD: Using an online survey, the entire population of      STATPack users evaluated the success of the information system by considering      system quality, information quality, system use, intention to use, user     satisfaction, individual impact, and organizational impact. RESULTS: The results       indicate that the overall quality of this ERMIS (i.e., system quality,      information quality, and service quality) has a positive impact on both user     satisfaction and intention to use the system. However, given the nature of ERMIS,      overall quality does not necessarily predict use of the system. Moreover, the      user's satisfaction with the information system positively affected the intention      to use the system. User satisfaction, intention to use, and system use had a      positive influence on the system's impact on the individual. Finally, the      organizational impacts of the system were positively influenced by use of the      system and the system's individual impact on the user. CONCLUSIONS: The results      of the study demonstrate how to evaluate the success of an ERMIS as well as      introduce potential changes in how one applies the DeLone and McLean success      model in an emergency response medical information system context.

PMID- 21497130   - OBJECTIVE: Increasingly health care facilities are adopting electronic medical      record systems and installing computer workstations in patient exam rooms. The      introduction of computer workstations into the medical interview process makes it      important to consider the impact of such technology on older patients as well as       new types of interfaces that may better suit the needs of older adults. While      many older adults are comfortable with a traditional computer workstation with a       keyboard and mouse, this article explores how a large horizontal touch-screen      (i.e., a surface computer) may suit the needs of older patients and facilitates      the doctor-patient interview process. METHOD: Twenty older adults (age 60 to 88)       used a prototype multiuser, multitouch system in our research laboratory to      examine seven health care scenarios. Behavioral observations as well as results      from questionnaires and a structured interview were analyzed. RESULTS: The older       adults quickly adapted to the prototype system and reported that it was easy to      use. Participants also suggested that having a shared view of one's medical      records, especially charts and images, would enhance communication with their     doctor and aid understanding. CONCLUSION: While this study is exploratory and      some areas of interaction with a surface computer need to be refined, the      technology is promising for sharing electronic patient information during medical      interviews involving older adults. Future work must examine doctors' and nurses'       interaction with the technology as well as logistical issues of installing such a      system in a real world medical setting.

PMID- 21493126   - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore inequities in access to online health      information and its relation to socioeconomic status, and to inform the      development of the use of the Internet for health promotion. METHODS: We analyzed      cross-sectional baseline survey data for 664 first-time mothers from the Healthy       Beginnings Trial conducted in Southwest Sydney, Australia during 2007-2010.      First-time mothers' reports of their computer ownership, sources of health      information including Internet access and self-rated health as well as      demographic data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Multivariate      analysis was performed using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: We found that 37%       of first-time mothers reported not using the Internet for health information.      Maternal education level, household income level and having a computer at home      were significant factors associated with the use of the Internet for health      information after adjusting for other factors. Mothers who only had school      certificate or lower were 1.5 times more likely not to use the Internet for     health information than those with university/tertiary education [adjusted risk      ratio (ARR) 1.50, 95% CI 1.06-2.12, P=0.03]. Mothers with a household income of      less than $40,000 per year were 1.7 times more likely not to use the Internet for     health information than those with a household income over $80,000 per year (ARR       1.66, 95% CI 1.24-2.12, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important      implications for using the Internet for health promotion among young women. A      substantial number of first-time mothers do not access the Internet for health      information, in particular among those with lower levels of education, lower     household income and without a computer at home.

PMID- 21482183   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient falls are the leading cause of unintentional      injury and death among older adults. In 2000, falls resulted in over 10,300      elderly deaths, costing the United States approximately $179 million in incidence      and medical costs. Furthermore, non-fatal injuries caused by falls cost the      United States $19 billion annually. Health information technology (IT)      applications, specifically electronic falls reporting systems, can aid quality      improvement efforts to prevent patient falls. Yet, long-term residential care      facilities (LTRCFs) often do not have the financial resources to implement health      IT, and workers in these settings are often not ready to adopt such systems.      Additionally, most health IT evaluations are conducted in large acute-care      settings, so LTRCF administrators currently lack evidence to support the value of      health IT. METHODS: In this paper, we detail the development of a novel,      easy-to-use system to facilitate electronic patient falls reporting within a      LTRCF using off-the-shelf technology that can be inexpensively implemented in a      wide variety of settings. We report the results of four complimentary system      evaluation measures that take into consideration varied organizational      stakeholders' perspectives: (1) System-level benefits and costs, (2) system      usability, via scenario-based use cases, (3) a holistic assessment of users'      physical, cognitive, and marcoergonomic (work system) challenges in using the      system, and (4) user technology acceptance. We report the viability of collecting      and analyzing data specific to each evaluation measure and detail the relative      merits of each measure in judging whether the system is acceptable to each      stakeholder. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The electronic falls reporting system was      successfully implemented, with 100% reporting at 3-months post-implementation.      The system-level benefits and costs approach showed that the electronic system      required no initial investment costs aside from personnel costs and significant      benefits accrued from user time savings. The usability analysis revealed several       fixable design flaws and demonstrated the importance of scenario-based user     training. The technology acceptance model showed that users perceived the      reporting system to be useful and easy to use, even more so after implementation.      Finally, the holistic human factors evaluation identified challenges encountered       when nurses used the system as a part of their daily work, guiding further system      redesign. The four-pronged evaluation framework accounted for varied stakeholder       perspectives and goals and is a highly scalable framework that can be easily      applied to health IT implementations in other LTRCFs.

PMID- 21482182   - PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how informatics applications can      support the assessment and visualization of older adults' wellness. A theoretical      framework is presented that informs the design of a technology enhanced screening      platform for wellness. We highlight an ongoing pilot demonstration in an assisted      living facility where a community room has been converted into a living      laboratory for the use of diverse technologies (including a telehealth component       to capture vital signs and customized questionnaires, a gait analysis component      and cognitive assessment software) to assess the multiple aspects of wellness of       older adults. METHODS: A demonstration project was introduced in an independent      retirement community to validate our theoretical framework of informatics and      wellness assessment for older adults. Subjects are being recruited to attend a      community room and engage in the use of diverse technologies to assess cognitive       performance, physiological and gait variables as well as psychometrics pertaining      to social and spiritual components of wellness for a period of eight weeks. Data       are integrated from various sources into one study database and different      visualization approaches are pursued to efficiently display potential      correlations between different parameters and capture overall trends of wellness.      RESULTS: Preliminary findings indicate that older adults are willing to      participate in technology-enhanced interventions and embrace different      information technology applications given appropriate and customized training and      hardware and software features that address potential functional limitations and       inexperience with computers. CONCLUSION: Informatics can advance health care for       older adults and support a holistic assessment of older adults' wellness. The      described framework can support decision making, link formal and informal      caregiving networks and identify early trends and patterns that if addressed      could reduce adverse health events.

PMID- 21481635   - BACKGROUND: "The graying of the globe" has resulted in exponential rise in health      care expenses, over-worked health care professionals and a growing patient base      suffering from multiple chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Consumer     health technologies (CHT) are considered important catalysts for empowering      health care consumers to take a proactive role in managing their health and      related costs. Adoption rate and usability of such devices among the aging is far     from being satisfactory. Past studies noted the motivation for adoption by the      aging is dependent on the suitability/relevance, perceived usability and      anticipated benefits associated with usage of technological innovation.      Traditional information technology (IT) development adopts a systematic approach       without necessarily using a specific user model that personalizes the system to      the aging user groups. The aging patient population has unique needs arising from      progressive deterioration in both physiological and psychological abilities.      These needs are often ignored in the design, development, trial and adoption of      consumer health products resulting in low adoption and usage. OBJECTIVES: The      main objective of this research is to investigate the user-centered design (UCD),      specifically user profiles and personas, as methodological tools to inform the      design and development of CHT devices for an aging population. The adoption of      user profile and persona has not received much attention in health care      informatics research and, in particular, research involving CHT. Our work begins       to fill this void in three ways. We (1) illuminate the process of developing CHT       user profiles and personas for a Chinese elder population with a demanding health      care needs, i.e., self-management of chronic diabetes, with the hope that the      resulting profiles and personas may be used as foundational material for     informing the design, development and evaluation of CHT in other similar     contexts; (2) call attention to how to further enhance and complement traditional      user profile and persona techniques for CHT design by integrating cognitive      structures and present behavior that drive health care thinking, future behavior       and demand; (3) show how the profiles and personas can be used to inform      requirements, design and implementation decisions for a technology aimed at      facilitating CHT adoption and diffusion for the elderly. METHODOLOGY: To      exemplify process and application, we use an action-research methodology, where      user profiles and personas of an aging patient population were developed. The      resultant profiles and personas were leveraged to improve the design, development      and implementation plans of a smart phone application to assist chronically ill      aging Chinese diabetic population capable of disease self-management. RESULTS:      The results from the study show that user profile and persona can be a valuable      methodological approach in capturing the conceptual model of the aging and      informing the design and development decisions of CHT. The demonstration of      techniques used in this study can serve as a guideline to CHT developers in      bringing conceptual user modeling into the design of software interfaces targeted      for users with specific health care needs. Specifically, the study provides      guidance on the creation and use of profiles and personas to tap into the      conceptual models of the targeted elderly population reflecting their     preferences, capabilities and attitudes towards using technology in      self-management care in general and the smart phone diabetes management      application in particular. Insight into the mental model of the aging group has      been shown to inform later stages of UCD development (e.g., the creation of      prototypes and usability testing) as well as implementation and adoption      strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2025, 80% of all      new cases of diabetes are expected to appear in the developing countries. In      fact, the number of diabetic patients in China is estimated to rise to 42.3      million in 2030 from 20.8 million in 2000. Thus, we investigate the Chinese aging      population in order to demonstrate the process of developing and using user     profile and persona. We hope that the resultant conceptual model of the Chinese      aging diabetic population can be used in future research to guide CHT designers      interested in designing health care devices for this vulnerable user group.

PMID- 21481634   - INTRO: The proper use of ICT services can support seniors in living independently      longer. While such services are starting to emerge, current proprietary solutions      are often expensive, covering only isolated parts of seniors' needs, and lack      support for sharing information between services and between users. For     developers, the challenge is that it is complex and time consuming to develop      high quality, interoperable services, and new techniques are needed to simplify      the development and reduce the development costs. This paper provides the      complete view of the experiences gained in the MPOWER project with respect to      using model-driven development (MDD) techniques for Service Oriented Architecture      (SOA) system development in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain. METHOD: To       address this challenge, the approach of the European research project MPOWER     (2006-2009) was to investigate and record the user needs, define a set of      reusable software services based on these needs, and then implement pilot systems      using these services. Further, a model-driven toolchain covering key development       phases was developed to support software developers through this process.      Evaluations were conducted both on the technical artefacts (methodology and      tools), and on end user experience from using the pilot systems in trial sites.      RESULTS: The outcome of the work on the user needs is a knowledge base recorded      as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model. This comprehensive model describes      actors, use cases, and features derived from these. The model further includes      the design of a set of software services, including full trace information back      to the features and use cases motivating their design. Based on the model, the      services were implemented for use in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems,      and are publicly available as open source software. The services were      successfully used in the realization of two pilot applications. There is      therefore a direct and traceable link from the user needs of the elderly, through      the service design knowledge base, to the service and pilot implementations. The       evaluation of the SOA approach on the developers in the project revealed that SOA      is useful with respect to job performance and quality. Furthermore, they think      SOA is easy to use and support development of AAL applications. An important      finding is that the developers clearly report that they intend to use SOA in the       future, but not for all type of projects. With respect to using model-driven      development in web services design and implementation, the developers reported      that it was useful. However, it is important that the code generated from the      models is correct if the full potential of MDD should be achieved. The pilots and      their evaluation in the trial sites showed that the services of the platform are       sufficient to create suitable systems for end users in the domain. CONCLUSIONS: A      SOA platform with a set of reusable domain services is a suitable foundation for       more rapid development and tailoring of assisted living systems covering      reoccurring needs among elderly users. It is feasible to realize a tool-chain for     model-driven development of SOA applications in the AAL domain, and such a      tool-chain can be accepted and found useful by software developers.

PMID- 21481633   - PURPOSE: This paper describes proposed health care services innovations, provided      by a system called CAALYX (Complete Ambient Assisted Living eXperiment). CAALYX      aimed to provide healthcare innovation by extending the state-of-the-art in      tele-healthcare, by focusing on increasing the confidence of elderly people      living autonomously, by building on the knowledge base of the most common      disorders and respective characteristic vital sign changes for this age group.      METHODS: A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried      out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the      elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could      improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve      this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and      interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically      triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we      started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that      could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation      of CAALYX was done. FINDINGS: The innovation in CAALYX system considers three      main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to      collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home      Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at      home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that      supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for     monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and      Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and      care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and      Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are       presented here. CONCLUSIONS: The ageing European society is placing an added      burden on future generations, as the 'elderly-to-working-age-people' ratio is set      to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows       for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties.      Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose      their own lifestyle. The CAALYX system can have a clear impact in increasing      older persons' autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their     preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.

PMID- 21481632   - INTRODUCTION: The Internet has emerged as a potentially effective medium for     information exchange. The Internet's potential has been recognised and web-based       education programmes have been steadily adopted in recent years in preventing and      managing chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. This review provides a      descriptive discussion of web-based behavioural interventions for the management       of type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHOD: Systematic literature searches were      performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Cochrane      Library to retrieve articles published between 2000 and June 2010 which fulfilled      all inclusion criteria. Methodological quality assessment and data synthesis were      then performed. RESULTS: Twenty articles representing 13 different studies were      reviewed. None of the studies were ranked as low in the methodological quality.      Goal-setting, personalised coaching, interactive feedback and online peer support      groups were some of the successful approaches which were applied in      e-interventions to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. Strong theoretical      background, use of other technologies and longer duration of intervention were      proven to be successful strategies as well. CONCLUSION: The web-based      interventions have demonstrated some level of favourable outcomes, provided they       are further enhanced with proper e-research strategies.

PMID- 21481631   - BACKGROUND: : The proportion of older adults in the population is steadily      increasing, causing healthcare costs to rise dramatically. This situation calls      for the implementation of health-related information and communication      technologies (ICT) to assist in providing more cost-effective healthcare to the      elderly. In order for such a measure to succeed, older adults must be prepared to      adopt these technologies. Prior research shows, however, that this population      lags behind in ICT adoption, although some believe that this is a temporary      phenomenon that will soon change. OBJECTIVES: : To assess use by older adults of       technology in general and ICT in particular, in order to evaluate their readiness      to adopt health-related ICT. METHOD: : We employed the questionnaire used by      Selwyn et al. in 2000 in the UK, as well as a survey instrument used by Morris      and Venkatesh, to examine the validity of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in      the context of computer use by older employees. 123 respondents answered the      questions via face-to-face interviews, 63 from the US and 60 from Israel. SPSS      17.0 was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: : The results show that although      there has been some increase in adoption of modern technologies, including ICT,      most of the barriers found by Selwyn et al. are still valid. ICT use was      determined by accessibility of computers and support and by age, marital status,       education, and health. Health, however, was found to moderate the effect of age,       healthier older people being far more likely to use computers than their     unhealthy coevals. The TPB was only partially supported, since only perceived      behavioral control (PBC) emerged as significantly affecting intention to use a      computer, while age, contrary to the findings of Morris and Venkatesh, interacted      differently for Americans and Israelis. The main reason for non-use was 'no      interest' or 'no need', similar to findings from data collected in 2000.      CONCLUSIONS: : Adoption of technology by older adults is still limited, though it      has increased as compared with results of the previous study. Modern technologies      have been adopted (albeit selectively) by older users, who were presumably      strongly motivated by perceived usefulness. Particularly worrying are the effects      of health, PBC, and the fact that many older adults do not share the perception      that ICT can significantly improve their quality of life. We therefore maintain      that older adults are not yet ready to adopt health-related ICT. Health-related      ICT for the elderly should be kept simple and demonstrate substantial benefits,      and special attention should be paid to training and support and to specific      personal and cultural characteristics. These are mandatory conditions for     adoption by potential unhealthy and older consumers.

PMID- 21474368   - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the medical professionals and medical students perceived       usefulness of an emergency medical card (EMC) and a continuity of care (CoC)      report, in enhancing CoC. METHODS: The study reviewers included medical      professionals from outpatient clinics at Intermountain Healthcare and fourth-year     medical students from the University of Utah. Three cases we randomly extracted      from a database of patients who had added new care information at the time. EMCs       and CoC reports were populated for the cases, and information then de-identified.      Using patient information in the electronic medical record (EMR), reviewers      evaluated if the EMR information was adequate to support medical decisions made      on the patient's diagnosis, medications, laboratory tests, and disposition. The      reviewer assessed if the EMC and CoC report information would influence the      medical decisions made. An online survey was used to assess the reviewers'      perception on the usefulness of the two documents. RESULTS: On average, 94% of      the reviewers perceived the EMC to be useful in enhancing medical decision making      at the point of care, and 74% found the CoC report to be useful. More      specifically, the two documents were found to be useful in decreasing encounter     time (100% each), increasing overall knowledge of healthcare providers (100%      each), influencing decision on the treatment (94% each), and new laboratory test       orders (87% and 90%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The EMC and CoC report were      found to be useful methods for transporting patient healthcare information across      the healthcare continuum. The documents were found more specifically to be useful      for effective decision making, improving efficiency and quality of care, at the      point of care.

PMID- 21470906   - OBJECTIVE: Nurses need to be competent and confident in performing drug      calculations to ensure patient safety. The purpose of this study is to compare an      interactive e-drug calculations package, developed using Cognitive Load Theory as      its theoretical framework, with traditional handout learning support on nursing      students' drug calculation ability, self-efficacy and support material      satisfaction. DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the      e-package with traditional handout learning support was conducted with a      September cohort (n=137) and a February cohort (n=92) of second year diploma      nursing students. Students from each cohort were geographically dispersed over 3       or 4 independent sites. MEASUREMENTS: Students from each cohort were invited to      participate, halfway through their second year, before and after a 12 week      clinical practice placement. During their placement the intervention group      received the e-drug calculations package while the control group received      traditional 'handout' support material. Drug calculation ability and      self-efficacy tests were given to the participants pre- and post-intervention.      Participants were given the support material satisfaction scale      post-intervention. RESULTS: Students in both cohorts randomised to e-learning      were more able to perform drug calculations than those receiving the handout      (September: mean 48.4% versus 34.7%, p=0.027; February: mean 47.6% versus 38.3%,       p=0.024). February cohort students using the e-package were more confident in      performing drug calculations than those students using handouts (self-efficacy      mean 56.7% versus 45.8%, p=0.022). There was no difference in improved      self-efficacy between intervention and control for students in the September     cohort. Students who used the package were more satisfied with its use than the      students who used the handout (mean 29.6 versus 26.5, p=0.001), particularly with      regard to the package enhancing their learning (p=0.023), being an effective way       to learn (p=0.005), providing practice and feedback (p<0.001), being accessible      (p=0.027), user friendly (p=0.02) and providing learning enjoyment (p=0.022).      CONCLUSION: It is essential that nurses are educated and supported to become, and      remain, confident and competent in performing drug calculations. This study found      the e-drug calculations package, based on Cognitive Load Theory, to be      significantly more effective than a handout in improving students' drug      calculation ability and self-efficacy, with students who used the package being      significantly more satisfied with its use than students who used the handout.      This package could particularly be useful for the continuing professional      development of any healthcare professional involved in drug calculations.

PMID- 21459664   - OBJECTIVES: (i) To review contributions and limitations of decision support      systems for automatic recruitment of patients to clinical trials (Clinical Trial       Recruitment Support Systems, CTRSS). (ii) To characterize the important features       of this domain, the main classes of approach that have been used, and their     advantages and disadvantages. (iii) To assess the effectiveness and potential of       such systems in improving trial recruitment rates. DATA SOURCES: A systematic      MESH keyword-based search of Pubmed, Embase, and Scholar Google for relevant      CTRSS publications from January 1st 1998 to August 31st 2009 yielded 73      references, from which 33 relevant papers describing 28 distinct studies were      chosen for review, based on their report of a novel decision support system for     trial recruitment which reused already available patient data. METHOD: The      reviewed papers were classified using a modified version of an existing taxonomy       for clinical decision support systems, using 10 axes relevant to the trial      recruitment domain. RESULTS: It proved possible and useful to characterize CTRSS       on a relatively small number of dimensions and a number of clear trends emerge      from the study. Only nine papers reported a useful evaluation of the      effectiveness of the system in terms of trial pre-inclusion or enrolment rate.      While all the systems reviewed re-use structured and coded patient data none      attempts the more difficult task of using unstructured patient notes to      pre-screen for trial inclusion. Few studies address acceptance of systems by      clinicians, or integration into clinical workflow, and there is little evidence      of use of interoperability standards. CONCLUSIONS: System design, scope, and      assessment methodology vary significantly between papers, making it difficult to       establish the impact of different approaches on recruitment rate. It is clear,      however, that the pre-screening phase of trial recruitment is the most effective       part of the process to address with CTRSS, that clinical workflow integration and      clinician acceptance are critical for this class of decision support, and that      the current trends in this field are towards generalization and scalability.

PMID- 21450517   - PURPOSE: To determine the changes each Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine      Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) release undergoes and the implications of those      changes. METHODS: (1) We reviewed the SNOMED CT Component History documentation      and analyzed the Component History table in detail. (2) We outlined a list of      semantic changes that are made to SNOMED CT concepts that are not recorded as      part of the Component History mechanism. (3) We reviewed the SNOMED CT Concept      Model mechanism and how it has changed since the July 2006 release. We applied      the above methods to determine the impact they had on the Clinical Observations      Recording and Encoding (CORE) Problem List published by the United States      National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health. RESULTS: Of the 5182       concepts in the problem list subset, 2135 (41.2%) underwent some form of change      in the form of (1) fully specified name and preferred term; (2) concept status;      (3) primitive/fully defined status, defining attributes and normal forms; and/or       (4) position in hierarchy (top-level hierarchy, supertypes and subtypes).      CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we have identified four types of changes that occur     over time as new SNOMED CT releases are introduced. Keeping track of these      changes is important as they are not well published and have an impact in patient      case queries and the accuracy of patient records.

PMID- 21439898   - INTRODUCTION: Ambient intelligence technologies are a means to support      ageing-in-place by monitoring clients in the home. In this study, monitoring is      applied for the purpose of raising an alarm in an emergency situation, and      thereby, providing an increased sense of safety and security. Apart from these      technological solutions, there are numerous environmental interventions in the      home environment that can support people to age-in-place. The aim of this study      was to investigate the needs and motives, related to ageing-in-place, of the      respondents receiving ambient intelligence technologies, and to investigate      whether, and how, these technologies contributed to aspects of ageing-in-place.      METHODOLOGY: This paper presents the results of a qualitative study comprised of       interviews and observations of technology and environmental interventions in the       home environment among 18 community-dwelling older adults with a complex demand      for care. These respondents had a prototype of the Unattended Autonomous      Surveillance system, an example of ambient intelligence technology, installed in       their homes as a means to age-in-place. The UAS-system offers a large range of      functionalities, including mobility monitoring, voice response, fire detection,      as well as wandering detection and prevention, which can be installed in      different configurations. RESULTS: The respondents had various motives to use      ambient intelligence technologies to support ageing-in-place. The most prominent       reason was to improve the sense of safety and security, in particular, in case of      fall incidents, when people were afraid not to be able to use their existing      emergency response systems. The ambient intelligence technologies were initially       seen as a welcome addition to strategies already adopted by the respondents,      including a variety of home modifications and assistive devices. The systems      tested increased the sense of safety and security and helped to postpone      institutionalisation. Respondents came up with a set of specifications in terms      of the operation and the design of the technology. False alarms were also      regarded as a sign that the ambient intelligence technology is functioning.      Moreover, a good integration of the new technologies in the provision of health      care is indispensable, and installation should be done in an acceptable and      unobtrusive manner. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Ambient intelligence      technologies can contribute to an increased safety and security at home. The      technologies alone offer no all encompassing solution as home care and additional      environmental interventions are still needed to support ageing-in-place. Results       of the study are used to further improve the ambient intelligence technologies      and their implementation.

PMID- 21439897   - BACKGROUND: As the volume of biomedical text increases exponentially, automatic      indexing becomes increasingly important. However, existing approaches do not      distinguish central (or core) concepts from concepts that were mentioned in      passing. We focus on the problem of indexing MEDLINE records, a process that is      currently performed by highly trained humans at the National Library of Medicine       (NLM). NLM indexers are assisted by a system called the Medical Text Indexer     (MTI) that suggests candidate indexing terms. OBJECTIVE: To improve the ability      of MTI to select the core terms in MEDLINE abstracts. These core concepts are      deemed to be most important and are designated as "major headings" by MEDLINE      indexers. We introduce and evaluate a graph-based indexing methodology called      MEDRank that generates concept graphs from biomedical text and then ranks the      concepts within these graphs to identify the most important ones. METHODS: We      insert a MEDRank step into the MTI and compare MTI's output with and without      MEDRank to the MEDLINE indexers' selected terms for a sample of 11,803 PubMed      Central articles. We also tested whether human raters prefer terms generated by      the MEDLINE indexers, MTI without MEDRank, and MTI with MEDRank for a sample of      36 PubMed Central articles. RESULTS: MEDRank improved recall of major headings      designated by 30% over MTI without MEDRank (0.489 vs. 0.376). Overall recall was       only slightly (6.5%) higher (0.490 vs. 0.460) as was F(2) (3%, 0.408 vs. 0.396).       However, overall precision was 3.9% lower (0.268 vs. 0.279). Human raters      preferred terms generated by MTI with MEDRank over terms generated by MTI without      MEDRank (by an average of 1.00 more term per article), and preferred terms      generated by MTI with MEDRank and the MEDLINE indexers at the same rate.      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of MEDRank to MTI significantly improved the retrieval       of core concepts in MEDLINE abstracts and more closely matched human expectations      compared to MTI without MEDRank. In addition, MEDRank slightly improved overall      recall and F(2).

PMID- 21435943   - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of two usability evaluation methods,      cognitive walkthrough (CW) and think aloud (TA), for identifying usability      problems and to compare the performance of CW and TA in identifying different      types of usability problems. METHODS: A CW was performed by two usability      evaluators and 10 physicians were recruited to perform a TA usability testing of       a CPOE system (Medicator). The severity of identified usability problems was      determined and the usability problems were categorized based on the User Action      Framework (UAF). The potential of usability problems to cause medication errors      was also determined. The thoroughness, validity and effectiveness of the two      methods were compared. RESULTS: Fifty seven unique usability problems of      different severity, spread over the four phases of interaction as defined by the       UAF, were identified. The effectiveness of the TA method for identifying      usability problems was 0.08 higher than that of the CW (0.70 vs. 0.62). The      thoroughness (the extent to which a method can identify existing usability      problems) of the TA was higher for the "Planning" and "Assessment" phases and      lower for the "Translation" phase (as defined by UAF). The thoroughness of TA for     identifying problems that may potentially result in medication errors was higher       than that of CW (0.81 vs. 0.68). The number of usability problems identified by      each of the methods was significantly less than the total number of detected real      usability problems in Medicator (p<0.001). The observed differences between the      number of real usability problems identified by CW and TA (38 vs. 41), the      difference between the average severity of the detected problems by CW and TA      (2.37 vs. 2.41), and the difference for identifying problems potentially      resulting in medication errors (15 vs. 18) were not statistically significant      (p>0.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although TA showed a slightly better       effectiveness, there is no significant difference between the performance of the       CW and the TA methods in terms of number of usability problems identified and the      mean severity of these problems. Since no single evaluation method will uncover     all of the usability problems a combination of methods is advised as the most      appropriate approach, especially if usability problems can lead to potentially      fatal outcomes.

PMID- 21420902   - PURPOSE: In today's workplace, nurses are highly skilled professionals possessing      expertise in both information technology and nursing. Nursing informatics      competencies are recognized as an important capability of nurses. No established       guidelines existed for nurses in Asia. This study focused on identifying the      nursing informatics competencies required of nurses in Taiwan. METHODS: A      modified Web-based Delphi method was used for two expert groups in nursing,      educators and administrators. Experts responded to 323 items on the Nursing      Informatics Competencies Questionnaire, modified from the initial work of      Staggers, Gassert and Curran to include 45 additional items. Three Web-based      Delphi rounds were conducted. Analysis included detailed item analysis.      Competencies that met 60% or greater agreement of item importance and appropriate      level of nursing practice were included. RESULTS: N=32 experts agreed to      participate in Round 1, 23 nursing educators and 9 administrators. The      participation rates for Rounds 2 and 3=68.8%. By Round 3, 318 of 323 nursing      informatics competencies achieved required consensus levels. Of the new      competencies, 42 of 45 were validated. A high degree of agreement existed for     specific nursing informatics competencies required for nurses in Taiwan (97.8%).       CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a current master list of nursing informatics      competency requirements for nurses at four levels in the U.S. and Taiwan. The      results are very similar to the original work of Staggers et al. The results have      international relevance because of the global importance of information      technology for the nursing profession.

PMID- 21419695   - OBJECTIVES: To study the satisfaction of end-users of a computerized physician      order entry (CPOE) system concerning ease of use and the effect on users'      workflow, efficiency, and medication safety and to seek users' opinions regarding      required improvements of the system. Usability evaluation had shown that this      system, which was in use for almost a decade, contained a number of severe      usability problems. So another objective of the study was to determine whether     there was a direct relation between user satisfaction and the results of a      usability evaluation of the system. METHODS: Two survey questionnaires were      distributed to CPOE system users (physicians and nurses) working in inpatient      departments of a university hospital. Questionnaires included items that were      rated using a five point Likert scale. Multiple choice questions with space for     free text additions also were used to collect qualitative data concerning the use      of the CPOE system and the users' opinion concerning system requirements for     improvement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and by the use of      Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen      physicians and 587 nurses were eligible to participate in this study (response      rate 49% and 56% respectively). Physicians were satisfied with the CPOE ease of      use (median 3.8, interquartile range [IQR] 3.3-4), and the effect on workflow      (median 3.7, IQR 3.3-4), medication safety (median 3.75, IQR 3-4), and efficiency      (median 4, IQR 3-4). Nurses also had a positive attitude towards CPOE ease of use      (median 3.6, IQR 3-4), and its effect on workflow (median 3, IQR 3-3.6),      medication safety (median 3, IQR 2.5-3.5), and efficiency (median 3.5, IQR 3-4).       Users mainly indicated that the system needs: supplementary functionalities (e.g.      alerts for allergies), improvement of current functionalities, integration with      other hospital information systems and improvement of information presentation      (e.g. a clear medication overview). Users did not use some current      functionalities because of lack of awareness of the functionalities or having      difficulty in using them. CONCLUSIONS: Users of this CPOE system, which was used       for almost a decade, were satisfied with the system's ease of use and its effect       on efficiency, workflow and medication safety although the system showed many      usability problems and lacked some functionalities. In this case study,      therefore, there seems no direct relation between the results of the earlier     performed usability evaluation and user satisfaction as determined in the current      study.

PMID- 21411365   - PURPOSE: Medical documentation is often incomplete. Missing information may      impede or bias analysis of study data and can cause delays. In a single source      information system, clinical routine documentation and electronic data capture      (EDC) systems are connected in the hospital information system (HIS). In this      setting, both clinical routine and research would benefit from a higher rate of      complete documentation. METHODS: We designed a HIS-based reminder system which      identifies not yet finalized forms and sends reminder e-mails to responsible      physicians depending on escalation level. The generic concept to create reminder       e-mail messages consists in database queries on not-finalized forms and      generation of e-mail messages based on this output via the communication server.       We compared completeness of electronic HIS forms before and after introduction of      the reminder system three months each. RESULTS: Completeness increased highly      significantly (p<0.0001) for each form type (medical history form 93% (145 of 156      forms) vs 100% (206 forms), stress injection protocol 90% (142 of 157 forms) vs      100% (198 forms) and rest injection protocol 31% (45 of 147 forms) vs 100% (208      forms)). Forty-six reminder e-mails to the responsible study physician and 53      reminder e-mails to the principal investigator were sent to finish 2 medical      history forms, 8 stress and 20 rest injection protocols. These 2 medical history       forms were completed after 1 and 56 days. The median processing time of the      stress injection protocols in the post-implementation phase was 18 days (range      from 1 to 60 days). The median processing time of the rest injection protocols      was 26 days (range from 5 to 37 days). CONCLUSION: A computer-based reminder     system to identify incomplete documentation forms with a notification and      escalation mechanism can improve completeness of finalized forms significantly.      It is technically feasible and effective in the clinical setting.

PMID- 21398174   - BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers and their IT staff, working in an effort to      balance appropriate accessibility with stricter security mandates, are      considering the use of a single network sign-on approach for authentication and      password management. Single sign-on (SSO) promises to improve usability of      authentication for multiple-system users, increase compliance, and help curb      system maintenance costs. However, complexities are introduced when SSO is placed      within a collaborative environment. These complexities include unanticipated      workflow implications that introduce greater security vulnerability for the      individual user. OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY: In this work, we examine the      challenges of implementing a single sign-on authentication technology in a      hospital environment. The aim of the study was to document the factors that      affected SSO adoption within the context of use. The ultimate goal is to better     inform the design of usable authentication systems within collaborative      healthcare work sites. The primary data collection techniques used are      ethnographically informed - observation, contextual interviews, and document      review. The study included a cross-section of individuals from various      departments and varying rolls. These participants were a mix of both clinical and      administrative staff, as well as the Information Technology group. RESULTS: The      field work revealed fundamental mis-matches between the technology and routine      work practices that will significantly impact its effective adoption. While      single sign-on was effective in the administrative offices, SSO was not a good      fit for collaborative areas. The collaborative needs of the clinical staff      unearthed tensions in its implementation. An analysis of the findings revealed      that the workflow, activities, and physical environment of the clinical areas      create increased security vulnerabilities for the individual user. The clinical      users were cognizant of these vulnerabilities and this created resistance to the       implementation due to a concern for privacy. CONCLUSION: From a preliminary      analysis of our on-going field study at a community hospital, there appears to be      a number of mismatches between the SSO vision and the realities of routine work.       While we cannot conclusively say if a SSO adoption will be effective in meeting      its goals in a hospital environment, we do know that it will affect the work      practice and that will make the management of the SSO system problematic.

PMID- 21377408   - AIM: The aim of the paper was to identify the models of information exchange for       UK telehealth systems. METHODOLOGY: Twelve telehealth offerings were evaluated      and models representing the information exchange routes were constructed.      Questionnaires were used to validate the diagrammatical representations of the      models with a response rate of 55%. RESULTS: The models were classified as      possessing four sections: preparing for data transfer, data transfer, information      generation and information transfer from health professional to patient. In      preparing for data transfer, basic data entry was automated in most systems      though additional inputs (i.e. information about diet, lifestyle and medication)       could be entered before the data was sent into the telehealth system. For the      data transfer aspect, results and additional inputs were sent to intermediate      devices, which were connectors between point-of-care devices, patients and health      professionals. Data were then forwarded to either a web portal, a remote database      or a monitoring/call centre. Information generation was either through      computational methods or through the expertise of health professionals.      Information transfer to the patient occurred in four forms: email, telehealth      monitor message, text message or phone call. CONCLUSION: On comparing the models,      three generic models were outlined. Five different forms of information exchange       between users of the system were identified: patient-push, system-stimulation,      dialogue, health professional-pull and observation. Patient-push and health      professional-pull are the dominant themes from the telehealth offerings      evaluated.

PMID- 21334969   - PURPOSE: Hospital medicine necessitates that practitioners from many disciplines       collaborate to care for patients with complex illnesses. Much emphasis is placed       on multi-disciplinary interaction during the ward round to achieve collaboration,      but it can still be difficult to attain. This paper looks at how electronic      medical records affect multi-disciplinary collaboration during ward rounds.      METHODS: We take an embodied approach, with a specific focus on the spatial and      postural patterning of bodies in space. Using F-formation system theory as an      analytical starting point, we compare the non-verbal interaction systems that      support multi-disciplinary interaction during usage of a paper medical record and      an electronic medical record at two points after deployment. RESULTS: We show      that the paper medical record supports a nuanced non-verbal interaction system      which is used to negotiate the ward round interaction and facilitate      multi-disciplinary communication. We also illustrated how the electronic medical       record initially fails to support a similar non-verbal interaction system, but      with some adjustments over time, the ward round team re-establishes a functioning      non-verbal interaction system and with it, multi-disciplinary communication.      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude with a discussion on the effects of electronic medical      records on multi-disciplinary interaction and suggest a number of implications      for their design: including, considering the social ergonomics of the device, the      inclusion of paper in electronic medical records, addressing data fixation, and      facilitating practitioners to make social changes to the interaction through the       ability to make technical changes to the system.

PMID- 21334255   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how staff working in the       perioperative domain copes with unforeseen events and in what way, if at all;      they are supported in this by formal systems such as information systems. DESIGN:      Case study. We conducted our study in the Department of Surgery in a large      academic hospital in Norway. The department consists of eight operating rooms for     planned surgery. The study included observations and interviews, in addition to      one design workshop with health personnel. We focused on planned surgery.      RESULTS: Our observations showed that unforeseen events that cause deviations      from plans are characteristic and that staff apply different coping strategies to      make the plan work regardless. Support of these coping strategies by formal      systems is poor. DISCUSSION: We used the concept of high-reliability      organisations as proposed by Weick and Sutcliffe, 2007, to analyse the observed      coping strategies. The coping strategies can be seen as examples of the      principles for managing the unexpected that Weick and Sutcliffe propose. IT      support for this must include both awareness-creating systems and systems that      enable workers to control the effects of unforeseen events once they have      occurred.

PMID- 21333590   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how current visual      representations of organizational and technological processes do not fully      account for the variability present in everyday practices. We further demonstrate      how narrative networks can augment these representations to indicate potential      areas for successful or problematic adoption of new technologies and potential      needs for additional training. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study of the      processes and routines at a major academic medical center slated to be supported       by the development and installation of a new comprehensive HIT system. We used      qualitative data collection techniques including observations of the activities      to be supported by the new system and interviews with department heads,      researchers, and both clinical and non-clinical staff. We conducted a narrative      network analysis of these data by choosing exemplar processes to be modeled,      selecting and analyzing narrative fragments, and developing visual      representations of the interconnection of these narratives. RESULTS: Narrative      networks enable us to view the variety of ways work has been and can be performed      in practice, influencing our ability to design for innovation in use. DISCUSSION:      Narrative networks are a means for analyzing and visualizing organizational      routines in concert with more traditional requirements engineering, workflow      modeling, and quality improvement outcome measurement. This type of analysis can       support a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how and why certain routines      continue to exist, change, or stop entirely. At the same time, it can illuminate       areas in which adoption may be slow, more training or communication may be      needed, and routines preferred by the leadership are subverted by routines      preferred by the staff.

PMID- 21333589   - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to create a step-by-step method for     transforming clinical rules for use in decision support, and to validate this      method for usability and reliability. METHODS: A sample set of clinical rules was      identified from the relevant literature. Using an iterative approach with a focus      group of mixed clinical and informatics experts, a method was developed for     assessing and formalizing clinical rules. Two assessors then independently      applied the method to a separate validation set of rules. Usability was assessed       in terms of the time required and the error rate, and reliability was assessed by      comparing the results of the two assessors. RESULTS: The resulting method, called      the Logical Elements Rule Method, consists of 7 steps: (1) restate the rule      proactively; (2) restate the rule as a logical statement (preserving key      phrases); (3) assess for conflict between rules; (4) identify concepts which are       not needed; (5) classify concepts as crisp or fuzzy, find crisp definitions      corresponding to fuzzy concepts, and extract data elements from crisp concepts;      (6) identify rules which are related by sharing patients, actions, etc.; (7)      determine availability of data in local systems. Validation showed that the      method was usable with rules from various sources and clinical conditions, and      reliable between users provided that the users agree on a terminology and agree      on when the rule will be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: A method is presented to assist       in assessing clinical rules for their amenability to decision support, and      formalizing the rules for implementation. Validation shows that the method is      usable and reliable between users. Use of a terminology increases reliability but      also the error rate. The method is useful for future developers of systems which       offer decision support based on clinical rules.

PMID- 21333588   - BACKGROUND: In January 2009, the Social Security Administration (SSA) began a      collaboration with MedVirginia to send authorized requests for and receipts of      patient health information using the Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis      through Health IT (MEGAHIT) application. This request and receipt used the      Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) for secure and interoperable Health      IT standards-based transport of patient information. METHODS: This case study,      conducted from June to November 2009, represents the first production exchange of      health information across the NwHIN. Interviews with 43 participants from a      variety of organizations are reported across technical, organizational, and      governance dimensions in terms of challenges, successes, and considerations for     moving forward. RESULTS: This case study reports on the technical,      organizational, and governance dimensions of collaboration. In terms of technical      success, the authorized medical evidence request and receipt took approximately 2      min, including Continuity of Care Document (CCD) rendering. Overall, this      resulted in mean case-processing time savings of 30%. Organizationally, the      production effort required collaboration among multiple stakeholders: SSA sought       claimant health information, MedVirginia provided patient health information, and      other parties, such as the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), facilitated       transport of patient information across the NwHIN. According to those involved,      this limited production effort tolerated and even benefited from an ad hoc      multiparty governance structure. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-party collaboration can      result in technical success, but achieving that success is dependent on a variety      of organizational factors. This case study highlights the significance of and      potential for requesting and receiving patient health information across the      NwHIN. It will inform interested collaborating stakeholders as SSA engages      additional providers in using MEGAHIT to collect health information via the      NwHIN.

PMID- 21330191   - OBJECTIVE: The development of readiness metrics for organizational participation       in health information exchange is critical for monitoring progress toward, and      achievement of, successful inter-organizational collaboration. In preparation for     the development of a tool to measure readiness for data-sharing, we tested      whether organizational capacities known to be related to readiness were      associated with successful participation in an American data-sharing      collaborative for quality improvement. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design, using an      on-line survey of hospitals in a large, mature data-sharing collaborative      organized for benchmarking and improvement in nursing care quality. MEASUREMENTS:      Factor analysis was used to identify salient constructs, and identified factors      were analyzed with respect to "successful" participation. "Success" was defined      as the incorporation of comparative performance data into the hospital dashboard.      RESULTS: The most important factor in predicting success included survey items      measuring the strength of organizational leadership in fostering a culture of      quality improvement (QI Leadership): (1) presence of a supportive hospital      executive; (2) the extent to which a hospital values data; (3) the presence of      leaders' vision for how the collaborative advances the hospital's strategic      goals; (4) hospital use of the collaborative data to track quality outcomes; and       (5) staff recognition of a strong mandate for collaborative participation      (alpha=0.84, correlation with Success 0.68 [P<0.0001]). CONCLUSION: The data      emphasize the importance of hospital QI Leadership in collaboratives that aim to       share data for QI or safety purposes. Such metrics should prove useful in the      planning and development of this complex form of inter-organizational      collaboration.

PMID- 21317028   - PURPOSE: This study presents a study of mobile information and communication      technology (ICT) for healthcare professionals in a surgical ward. The purpose of       the study was to create a participatory design process to investigate factors      that affect the acceptance of mobile ICT in a surgical ward. METHODS:      Observations, interviews, a participatory design process, and pilot testing of a       prototype of a co-constructed application were used. RESULTS: Informal rhythms      existed at the department that facilitated that people met and interacted several      times throughout the day. These gatherings allowed for opportunistic encounters      that were extensively used for dialogue, problem solving, coordination, message      and logistics handling. A prototype based on handheld mobile computers was      introduced. The tool supported information seeking functionality that previously       required local mobility. By making the nurses more freely mobile, the tool      disrupted these informal rhythms. This created dissatisfaction with the system,      and lead to discussion and introduction of other arenas to solve coordination and      other problems. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile ICT tools may break down informal      communication and coordination structures. This may reduce the efficiency of the       new tools, or contribute to resistance towards such systems. In some situations      however such "disrupted rhythms" may be overcome by including additional      sociotechnical mechanisms in the overall design to counteract this negative      side-effect.

PMID- 21317027   - BACKGROUND: As more healthcare delivery is provided by collaborative teams there       is a need for enhanced design of health information systems (HISs) to support      collaborative care delivery. The purpose of this study was to develop a model of       the different types of awareness that exist in interprofessional collaborative      care (ICC) delivery to inform HIS design to support ICC. METHODS: Qualitative      data collection and analysis was done. The data sources consisted of 90 h of      non-participant observations and 30 interviews with nurses, physicians, medical      residents, volunteers, and personal support workers. RESULTS: Many of the      macro-level ICC activities (e.g. morning rounds, shift change) were constituted      by micro-level activities that involved different types of awareness. We      identified four primary types of ICC awareness: patient, team member, decision      making, and environment. Each type of awareness is discussed and supported by      study data. We also discuss implication of our findings for enhanced design of      existing HISs as well as providing insight on how HISs could be better designed      to support ICC awareness. CONCLUSION: Awareness is a complex yet crucial piece of      successful ICC. The information sources that provided and supported ICC awareness      were varied. The different types of awareness from the model can help us      understand the explicit details of how care providers communicate and exchange      information with one another. Increased understanding of ICC awareness can assist      with the design and evaluation of HISs to support collaborative activities.

PMID- 21306940   - BACKGROUND: Trauma resuscitation involves multidisciplinary teams under surgical       leadership in most US trauma centers. Because many trauma centers have also      incorporated emergency department (ED) physicians, shared and cross-disciplinary       leadership structures often occur. Our study identifies leadership structures and      examines the effects of cross-disciplinary leadership on trauma teamwork.      METHODS: We conducted an ethnographic study at two US Level-1 trauma centers, one      of which is a dedicated pediatric trauma center. We used observation, videotaping      and interviews to contextualize and classify leadership structures in trauma      resuscitation. Leadership structures were evaluated based on three dimensions of       team performance: defined leadership, likelihood of conflict in decision making,       and appropriate care. FINDINGS: We identified five common leadership structures,       grouped under two broad leadership categories: solo decision-making and      intervening models within intra-disciplinary leadership; intervening, parallel,      and collaborative models within cross-disciplinary leadership. CONCLUSION: Most      important weaknesses of different leadership structures are manifested in      inefficient teamwork or inappropriate patient care. These inefficiencies are      particularly problematic when leadership is shared between physicians from      different disciplines with different levels of experience, which often leads to      conflict, reduces teamwork efficiency and lowers the quality of care. We discuss       practical implications for technology design.

PMID- 21300565   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of experienced      users of computerized patient documentation for the purpose of collaboration and       coordination. A secondary analysis of qualitative data using Clark's theoretical       framework of communication was conducted with the goal of bringing research      findings into design. METHODS: Physicians, nurses and administrative staff      volunteered to participate in focus groups at 4 VA sites. Each focus group lasted      1.5h and targeted experience and issues with using computerized documentation.      All focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed and submitted to extensive      qualitative analysis using ATLAS, iterative identification of concepts and      categories. The communication category was targeted for secondary theoretical      analysis in order to deepen understanding of the findings. Clark's theory of      communication, joint action and common ground heuristics was used to analyze      concepts. RESULTS: Key concepts included: (1) CPD has changed the way that      narrative documentation is used in clinical settings to include more      communication functions, strategies to establish joint action in both negative      and positive ways; (2) functionality added to CPD to increase the efficiency of      input may have increased the efficiency of CPD to support shared situation      models, joint and action and the establishment of common ground; (3) new usage of      CPD may increase tensions between clinical and administrative roles as the role      of narrative is re-defined. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates how      socio-technical systems co-evolve to support essential human function of      coordination and collaboration. Users adapted the system in unique and useful      ways that provide insight to future development.

PMID- 21295515   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to apply an informatics tool for dealing with      a medical decision aiding problem to help infertile couples to become parents,      when using assisted reproduction. METHODS: A multiple criteria decision aiding      method for sorting or ordinal classification problems, called Electre Tri-C, was       chosen in order to assign each couple to an embryo-transfer category. The set of       categories puts in evidence a way for increasing the single pregnancy rate, while      minimizing multiple pregnancies. The decision aiding sorting model was      co-constructed through an interaction process between the decision aiding      analysts and the medical experts. RESULTS: According to the sample used in this      study, the Electre Tri-C method provides a unique category in 86% of the cases      and it achieves a sorting accuracy of 61%. Retrospectively, the medical experts      do agree that some of their judgments concerning the number of embryos to      transfer back to the uterus of the woman could be different according to these      results. The current ART methodology achieves a single pregnancy rate of 47% and       a twin pregnancy rate of 14%. Thus, this informatics tools may play an important       role for supporting ART medical decisions, aiming to increase the single      pregnancy rate, while minimizing multiple pregnancies. LIMITATIONS: Building the       set of criteria comprises a part of arbitrariness and imperfect knowledge, which       require time and expertise to be refined. Among them, three criteria are modeled       by means of a holistic classification procedure by the medical experts.

PMID- 21292546   - PURPOSE: Healthcare reform as part of the economic recovery plan in Japan is      placing emphasis on the use of healthcare information technology (HIT). This      research mainly focuses on the HIT efforts in Japan with reference to the US for       context. The purpose is to: (a) provide detail on governmental policy impacting      promotion of HIT adoption to provide services to the people of Japan, (b)      describe the outcomes of past and present policy impacting progress based on a      case study of HIT use in the Kyoto Yamashina area, and (c) discuss issues for     refinement of current policy. METHODS: The method is case study, and data      collection techniques include: (a) interviews of people involved in policy making      for HIT in Japan (Japanese healthcare professionals, government officials, and      academics involved in HIT research in Japan) and use in the medical community of       HIT in the Kyoto Yamashina area, (b) archived document analysis of reports      regarding government policy for HIT policy and user assessment for HIT mainly in       the case study site, and (c) the literature review about HIT progression and      effectiveness assessments to explore and describe issues concerning the      transformation with HIT in Japan. RESULTS: This study reveals the aspects of      governmental policy that have been effective in promoting successful HIT      initiatives as well as some that have been detriments in Japan to help solve      pressing social issues regarding healthcare delivery. For example, Japan has      stipulated some standardized protocols and formats for HIT but does not mandate      exactly how to engage in inter-organizational or intra-organizational health      information exchange. This provides some desired autonomy for healthcare      organizations and or governments in medical communities and allows for more      advanced organizations to leverage current resources while providing a basis for       lesser equipped organizations to use in planning the initiative. The insights      gained from the Kyoto Yamashina area initiative reflect the success of past      governmental policy efforts and the current intent to promote HIT adoption.      Insights from the case study as well as other social issues facing Japan warrant       some refinement of policy. The refinement concerns: (a) the necessity for     leadership and IT knowledge in the medical communities, (b) provider incentives,       (c) legislation regarding accountability, security, privacy and confidentiality,       (d) inclusion of stakeholders in solution development, and (e) creating      sustainable business models. CONCLUSION: The research highlights the efforts of      Japan for using HIT in healthcare reform. We present outcomes from a case study      of the Kyoto Yamashina area medical community as proof of concept for past and      present policy in Japan that are insightful for proliferation of successful      projects in Japan and adoption of HIT in general.

PMID- 21288766   - PURPOSE: Increasingly, autoidentification technology is being utilized in      healthcare settings to make delivery of care cheaper, more efficient, and safer.       However, the risk of electromagnetic interference (EMI) when using these      autoidentification systems is not entirely clear. Thus, we sough to evaluate the       likelihood of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in high technology healthcare      areas with a low frequency, magnetic-field based wireless autoidentification      protocol. METHODS: Thirty-two devices were tested for EMI with an      autoidentification technology whose maximal magnetic field output ranged from 8      to 800mgauss between November 2008 and March 2009. Testing was performed at Mayo       Clinic (Rochester, MN) and Holy Cross Hospital (Miami, FL). All tests were      started from 4 feet away and devices were approached in 1 foot increments with      the signal antenna. EMI was characterized as light, significant, hazardous, or     none per established testing standards. Significant to hazardous EMI was      considered to potentially cause significant problems with clinical management of       patients. RESULTS: Of 32 devices, light to hazardous EMI was seen in 8 (25%).      Hazardous EMI was seen in 2 12-lead ECG machines, significant EMI in fluoroscopy,      echocardiograms, and 1 of 5 cardiac monitors, and light EMI in a defibrillator     and cardiac monitor. Average magnetic field strengths experienced by the devices       were similar at each distance regardless of the presence of EMI. No EMI was      recorded with any device at distances greater than 4 feet, with no loss of signal      fidelity at distances up to 17 feet. CONCLUSION: A low frequency, magnetic field       based wireless autoidentification technology induced distance dependent EMI in      healthcare settings, making implementation potentially safe at antenna distances       greater than 4 feet from clinical equipment. However, implementation requires      rigorous in vivo testing to ensure the antenna is located a safe distance away.

PMID- 21242104   - PURPOSE: To date few studies have compared nursing home caregivers' perceptions      about the quality of information and benefits of nursing documentation in paper     and electronic formats. With the increased interest in the use of information      technology in nursing homes, it is important to obtain information on the      benefits of newer approaches to nursing documentation so as to inform investment,      organisational and care service decisions in the aged care sector. This study      aims to investigate caregivers' perceptions about the quality of information and       benefits of nursing documentation before and after the introduction of an      electronic documentation system in a nursing home. METHODS: A self-administered      questionnaire survey was conducted three months before, and then six, 18 and 31      months after the introduction of an electronic documentation system. Further     evidence was obtained through informal discussions with caregivers. RESULTS:      Scores for questionnaire responses showed that the benefits of the electronic      documentation system were perceived by the caregivers as provision of more      accurate, legible and complete information, and reduction of repetition in data      entry, with consequential managerial benefits. However, caregivers' perceptions      of relevance and reliability of information, and of their communication and      decision-making abilities were perceived to be similar either using an electronic      or a paper-based documentation system. Improvement in some perceptions about the       quality of information and benefits of nursing documentation was evident in the      measurement conducted six months after the introduction of the electronic system,      but were not maintained 18 or 31 months later. CONCLUSIONS: The electronic      documentation system was perceived to perform better than the paper-based system       in some aspects, with subsequent benefits to management of aged care services. In      other areas, perceptions of additional benefits from the electronic documentation      system were not maintained. In a number of attributes, there were similar     perceptions on the two types of systems.

PMID- 21183402   - OBJECTIVES: Doctor shopping (or hospital shopping), which means changing doctors       (or hospitals) without professional referral for the same or similar illness      conditions, is common in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. Due to the lack of      infrastructure for sharing health information and medication history among      hospitals, doctor-shopping patients are more likely to receive duplicate      medications and suffer adverse drug reactions. The Bureau of National Health      Insurance (BNHI) adopted smart cards (or NHI-IC cards) as health cards in Taiwan.      With their NHI-IC cards, patients can freely access different medical      institutions. Because an NHI-IC card carries information about a patient's      prescribed medications received from different hospitals nationwide, we used this      system to address the problem of duplicate medications for outpatients visiting      multiple hospitals. METHODS: A computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system      was enhanced with the capability of accessing NHI-IC cards and providing alerts      to physicians when the system detects potential duplicate medications at the time      of prescribing. Physician responses to the alerts were also collected to analyze       changes in physicians' behavior. Chi-square tests and two-sided z-tests with      Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons were used to assess statistical      significance of differences in actions taken by physicians over the three months.      RESULTS: The enhanced CPOE system for outpatient services was implemented and      installed at the Pediatric and Urology Departments of Taipei Medical University      Wan-Fang Hospital in March 2007. The "Change Log" that recorded physician      behavior was activated during a 3-month study period from April to June 2007. In       67.93% of patient visits, the physicians read patient NHI-IC cards, and in 16.76%      of the reads, the NHI-IC card contained at least one prescribed medication that      was taken by the patient. Among the prescriptions issued by physicians, on      average, there were 2.36% prescriptions containing at least one medication that      might be duplicative to the prior prescriptions stored in NHI-IC cards. The rate       of potential duplicate medication alerts for the Pediatric Department was higher       than that for the Urology Department (2.78% versus 1.67%). However, the rate of      revisions to prescriptions was higher in the Urology Department than the      Pediatric Department. Overall, the rate of physicians reviewing and revising      their prescriptions was 29.25%; the rate of physicians reviewing without revising      their prescriptions was 43.62%; the rate of physicians turning off the alert      screens right after the screens popped up (overridden) was 27.13%. Thus,      physicians accepted alerts to review their prescriptions with patients in most      situations (72.87%). Moreover, over the study period, the rate of total revisions      made to prescriptions increased and the "overridden" rate decreased. CONCLUSIONS:      Our approach enhances the capability of CPOE systems using NHI-IC cards as a      nationwide infrastructure to provide more complete patient health information and      medication history sharing among hospitals in Taiwan. Thus, our system can      provide a better prescribing tool to help physicians detect potential duplicate      medications for frequent doctor-shopping patients and hence enhance patient      safety across hospital boundaries. However, the effectiveness of detecting      duplicate medications with our approach is very much dependent on the      completeness of NHI-IC cards, which in turn primarily depends on physician use of      the cards when prescribing.

PMID- 21168360   - INTRODUCTION: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) should be seamlessly      integrated with existing clinical information systems to enable automatic      provision of advice at the time and place where decisions are made. It has been      suggested that a lack of agreed data standards frequently hampers this      integration. We performed a literature review to investigate whether CDSSs used      standardized (i.e. coded or numerical) data and which terminological systems have      been used to code data. We also investigated whether a lack of standardized data       was considered an impediment for CDSS implementation. METHODS: Articles reporting      an evaluation of a CDSS that provided a computerized advice based on      patient-specific data items were identified based on a former literature review      on CDSS and on CDSS studies identified in AMIA's 'Year in Review'. Authors of      these articles were contacted to check and complete the extracted data. A      questionnaire among the authors of included studies was used to determine the      obstacles in CDSS implementation. RESULTS: We identified 77 articles published      between 1995 and 2008. Twenty-two percent of the evaluated CDSSs used only      numerical data. Fifty one percent of the CDSSs that used coded data applied an      international terminology. The most frequently used international terminology      were the ICD (International Classification of Diseases), used in 68% of the cases      and LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) in 12% of the cases.       More than half of the authors experienced barriers in CDSS implementation. In      most cases these barriers were related to the lack of electronically available      standardized data required to invoke or activate the CDSS. CONCLUSION: Many CDSSs      applied different terminological systems to code data. This diversity hampers the      possibility of sharing and reasoning with data within different systems. The      results of the survey confirm the hypothesis that data standardization is a      critical success factor for CDSS development.

PMID- 21167772   - OBJECTIVES: To describe experiences, lessons and the implications related to the       use of conferencing technology to support three drug policy research groups      within a three-year period, using the action case research method. DESIGN: An      action case research field study was executed. Three different drug policy groups      participated: research, educator, and decision-maker task groups. There were a      total of 61 participants in the study. The study was conducted between 2004 and      2007. Each group used audio-teleconferencing, web-conferencing or both to support      their knowledge exchange activities. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected over three      years and consisted of observation notes, interviews, and meeting transcripts.      Content analysis was used to analyze the data using NIVIO qualitative data      analysis software. RESULTS: The study found six key lessons regarding the impact       of conferencing technologies on knowledge exchange within drug policy groups. We       found that 1) groups adapt to technology to facilitate group communication, 2)      web-conferencing communication is optimal under certain conditions, 3) audio      conferencing is convenient, 4) web-conferencing forces group interactions to be      "within text", 5) facilitation contributes to successful knowledge exchange, and       6) technology impacts information sharing. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights      lessons related to the use of conferencing technologies to support distant      knowledge exchange within drug policy groups. Key lessons from this study can be       used by drug policy groups to support successful knowledge exchange activities      using conferencing technologies.

PMID- 21167771   - OBJECTIVE: To determine how patients and physicians balance the perceived      benefits and harms of sharing electronic health data for patient care and for     secondary purposes. DESIGN: Before-after survey of patients and providers in      practices using electronic medical records (EMRs) enrolled in a clinical trial in      Ontario, Canada. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were measured using the Health      Information Privacy Questionnaire (HIPQ) at baseline and end of study. Thirteen      questions in 4 general domains investigated attitudes towards the privacy of      EMRs, outsider's use of patient's health information, the sharing of patient's      information within the health care system, and the overall perception of benefits      versus harms of computerization in health care. RESULTS: 511 patients (mean age      60.3 years, 49.6% female) and 46 physicians (mean age 47.2 years, 37.0% female)      participated. Most (>90%) supported the computerized sharing of the patient's      health records among their health care professionals and to provide clinical      advice. Fewer agreed that the patient's de-identified information should be      shared outside of the health care circle (<70%). Only a minority of either group       supported the notion that computerized records can be keep more private than      paper records (38-50%). Overall, a majority (58% patients, 70% physicians)      believed that the benefits of computerization were greater than the risks of      confidentiality loss. This was especially true for patients who were frequent      computer users. DISCUSSION: While these primary care physicians and their     patients valued the clinical features of EMRs, a substantial minority have      concerns about the secondary use of de-identified information.

PMID- 21156351   - PURPOSE: To characterize physician attitudes and preferences towards health      information exchange (HIE), which is the ability to transmit health information      electronically across institutions, and identify factors that influence      physicians' interest in using HIE for their clinical work. METHODS: A survey was       conducted of physicians affiliated with institutions that are stakeholders of a      regional health information organization in the United States (U.S.). Surveys      were administered between May and October, 2009 at educational conferences and on      site at physician practices. RESULTS: Of the 328 physicians asked to participate,      44% (n=144) completed the survey. Sixty-eight percent (n=88) of physicians      expressed interest in using HIE for their clinical work. Most physicians expected      HIE to improve provider communication (89%), coordination and continuity of care       (87%) and efficiency (87%). Potential barriers to adopting or using HIE included       start-up costs (57%) and resources to select and implement a system (38%). A      majority reported that technical assistance (70%) and financial incentives to use      (65%) or purchase (54%) health IT systems would positively influence their     adoption and use of HIE. Physicians who believe that financial incentives would      be helpful, that HIE would be easy to use, or who prefer viewing patient health      information electronically were found to be at least three times more likely to      indicate they would adopt and use HIE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that      providers largely consider HIE as potentially valuable and a majority would be      willing to use HIE. Recent U.S. federal health IT policies that provide financial      incentives as well as technical assistance may address potential barriers to      adoption and usage of HIE.

PMID- 21147023   - PURPOSE: While information technology (IT) investments in healthcare are higher     than ever, there are contradictions in the literature regarding their ability to       improve productivity, quality of care and/or healthcare system efficiency. Using       theories that can help make sense of these contradictions, we propose a new      framework to assess the actual impacts of health information technology (HIT)      implementation. METHOD: Following an exhaustive literature review, we build upon       the 'productivity paradox' and 'stakeholder' theories to improve the evaluation      of IT impacts in healthcare. Interview data from three case studies of HIT      implementation in different hospitals were used to develop our proposed      framework. RESULTS: The empirical data analysis suggests that it is important:      (1) to identify, account for and accurately measure the appropriate impacts      (beneficial/adverse, expected/unforeseen effects); (2) to consider the context of      implementation; (3) to adopt a multi-level perspective (individual, group and      organization); and (4) to take into account the various stakeholders'      perspectives (managers, health professionals and patients). CONCLUSIONS: An      assessment framework was developed to provide general guidance on how to assess      HIT impacts. The proposed framework will be useful for researchers and      practitioners as it takes into account the underlying reasons for the HIT      productivity paradox and identifies the salient outcomes of interest linked to      HIT implementation.

PMID- 21145782   - OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterise different profiles of nurses'      utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the Internet      and to identify factors that can enhance or inhibit the use of these technologies      within nursing. METHODS: An online survey of the 13,588 members of the Nurses      Association of Barcelona who had a registered email account in 2006 was carried      out. Factor analysis, cluster analysis and binomial logit model was undertaken.      RESULTS/FINDINGS: Although most of the nurses (76.70%) are utilizing the Internet      within their daily work, multivariate statistics analysis revealed two profiles      of the adoption of ICT. The first profile (4.58%) represents those nurses who      value ICT and the Internet so that it forms an integral part of their practice.      This group is thus referred to as 'integrated nurses'. The second profile      (95.42%) represents those nurses who place less emphasis on ICT and the Internet       and are consequently labelled 'non-integrated nurses'. From the statistical      modelling, it was observed that undertaking research activities an emphasis on      international information and a belief that health information available on the      Internet was 'very relevant' play a positive and significant role in the      probability of being an integrated nurse. CONCLUSION: The emerging world of the      'integrated nurse' cannot be adequately understood without examining how nurses      make use of ICT and the Internet within nursing practice and the way this is      shaped by institutional, technical and professional opportunities and      constraints.

PMID- 21134784   - PURPOSE: Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is crucial to protecting      the public health of a society. Online news articles provide timely information      on disease outbreaks worldwide. In this study, we investigated automated      detection of articles relevant to disease outbreaks using machine learning      classifiers. In a real-life setting, it is expensive to prepare a training data      set for classifiers, which usually consists of manually labeled relevant and      irrelevant articles. To mitigate this challenge, we examined the use of randomly       sampled unlabeled articles as well as labeled relevant articles. METHODS: Naive      Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on 149 relevant      and 149 or more randomly sampled unlabeled articles. Diverse classifiers were      trained by varying the number of sampled unlabeled articles and also the number     of word features. The trained classifiers were applied to 15 thousand articles      published over 15 days. Top-ranked articles from each classifier were pooled and       the resulting set of 1337 articles was reviewed by an expert analyst to evaluate       the classifiers. RESULTS: Daily averages of areas under ROC curves (AUCs) over     the 15-day evaluation period were 0.841 and 0.836, respectively, for the naive      Bayes and SVM classifier. We referenced a database of disease outbreak reports to      confirm that this evaluation data set resulted from the pooling method indeed      covered incidents recorded in the database during the evaluation period.      CONCLUSIONS: The proposed text classification framework utilizing randomly      sampled unlabeled articles can facilitate a cost-effective approach to training      machine learning classifiers in a real-life Internet-based biosurveillance      project. We plan to examine this framework further using larger data sets and      using articles in non-English languages.

PMID- 21134783   - PURPOSE: Implementing an efficient Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system is      regarded as one of the key strategies for improving the quality of healthcare      services. However, the system's interoperability between medical devices and the       EMR is a big barrier to deploying the EMR system in an outpatient clinical      setting. The purpose of this study is to design a framework for a seamless and      comprehensively integrated medical device interface system, and to develop and      implement a system for accelerating the deployment of the EMR system. METHODS: We      designed and developed a framework that could transform data from medical devices      into the relevant standards and then store them in the EMR. The framework is      composed of 5 interfacing methods according to the types of medical devices      utilized at an outpatient clinical setting, registered in Samsung Medical Center       (SMC) database. The medical devices used for this study were devices that have      microchips embedded or that came packaged with personal computers. The devices      are completely integrated with the EMR based on SMC's long term IT strategies.      RESULTS: First deployment of integrating 352 medical devices into the EMR took      place in April, 2006, and it took about 48 months. By March, 2010, every medical       device was interfaced with the EMR. About 66,000 medical examinations per month      were performed taking up an average of 50GB of storage space. We surveyed users,       mainly the technicians. Out of 73 that responded, 76% of the respondents replied       that they were strongly satisfied or satisfied, 20% replied as being neutral and       only 4% complained about the speed of the system, which was attributed to the      slow speed of the old-fashioned medical devices and computers. CONCLUSION: The      current implementation of the medical device interface system based on the SMC      framework significantly streamlines the clinical workflow in a satisfactory      manner.

PMID- 21131230   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of applying       the openEHR archetype approach to modelling the data in the database of an      existing proprietary biobank information management system. A biobank information      management system stores the clinical/phenotypic data of the sample donor and      sample related information. The clinical/phenotypic data is potentially sourced      from the donor's electronic health record (EHR). The study evaluates the reuse of      openEHR archetypes that have been developed for the creation of an interoperable       EHR in the context of biobanking, and proposes a new set of archetypes      specifically for biobanks. The ultimate goal of the research is the development      of an interoperable electronic biomedical research record (eBMRR) to support      biomedical knowledge discovery. METHODS: The database of the prostate cancer     biobank of the Irish Prostate Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), which supports      the identification of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer, was taken as the      basis for the modelling effort. First the database schema of the biobank was      analyzed and reorganized into archetype-friendly concepts. Then, archetype      repositories were searched for matching archetypes. Some existing archetypes were      reused without change, some were modified or specialized, and new archetypes were      developed where needed. The fields of the biobank database schema were then      mapped to the elements in the archetypes. Finally, the archetypes were arranged      into templates specifically to meet the requirements of the PCRC biobank.      RESULTS: A set of 47 archetypes was found to cover all the concepts used in the      biobank. Of these, 29 (62%) were reused without change, 6 were modified and/or     extended, 1 was specialized, and 11 were newly defined. These archetypes were      arranged into 8 templates specifically required for this biobank. A number of      issues were encountered in this research. Some arose from the immaturity of the      archetype approach, such as immature modelling support tools, difficulties in      defining high-quality archetypes and the problem of overlapping archetypes. In      addition, the identification of suitable existing archetypes was time-consuming      and many semantic conflicts were encountered during the process of mapping the      PCRC BIMS database to existing archetypes. These include differences in the      granularity of documentation, in metadata-level versus data-level modelling, in      terminologies and vocabularies used, and in the amount of structure imposed on      the information to be recorded. Furthermore, the current way of modelling the      sample entity was found to be cumbersome in the sample-centric activity of      biobanking. CONCLUSIONS: The archetype approach is a promising approach to create      a shareable eBMRR based on the study participant/donor for biobanks. Many      archetypes originally developed for the EHR domain can be reused to model the      clinical/phenotypic and sample information in the biobank context, which      validates the genericity of these archetypes and their potential for reuse in the      context of biomedical research. However, finding suitable archetypes in the      repositories and establishing an exact mapping between the fields in the PCRC      BIMS database and the elements of existing archetypes that have been designed for     clinical practice can be challenging and time-consuming and involves resolving      many common system integration conflicts. These may be attributable to      differences in the requirements for information documentation between clinical      practice and biobanking. This research also recognized the need for better     support tools, modelling guidelines and best practice rules and reconfirmed the      need for better domain knowledge governance. Furthermore, the authors propose      that the establishment of an independent sample record with the sample as record       subject should be investigated. The research presented in this paper is limited      by the fact that the new archetypes developed during this research are based on a      single biobank instance. These new archetypes may not be complete, representing      only those subsets of items required by this particular database. Nevertheless,      this exercise exposes some of the gaps that exist in the archetype modelling      landscape and highlights the concepts that need to be modelled with archetypes to      enable the development of an eBMRR.

PMID- 21130682   - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore pressure ulcer incidences and      practice variations in the nursing intervention provided for preventive      pressure-ulcer care to patients either with pressure ulcers or at risk of      pressure ulcers, and to examine them in relation to the patients' medical      problems and the characteristics of the nurses who cared for them. METHODS: The      narrative nursing notes of 427 intensive-care patients who were discharged in      2007 that were documented at the point-of-care using standardized nursing      statements were extracted from a clinical data repository at a teaching hospital       in Korea and analyzed. The frequencies of five nursing interventions for     pressure-ulcer prevention were compared between pressure-ulcer and pressure-ulcer     risk groups, as were the characteristics of the nurses who were treating the      patients in these two groups. Nursing interventions for pressure-ulcer prevention      were also assessed relative to the patients' medical problems. RESULTS: The      overall incidence of pressure ulcers was 15.0%. Position change was the most      popular nursing intervention provided for pressure-ulcer prevention in both the      pressure-ulcer and at-risk groups, followed by skin care. There was a      statistically significant tendency toward a greater frequency of providing skin      care and nutritional care in the at-risk group than in the pressure-ulcer group.       There was no statistically significant difference in the mean frequencies of      nursing interventions relative to the patients' medical problems in the      pressure-ulcer group. However, frequencies of nursing interventions did differ     significantly between patients with neurological problems and those with other     medical problems in the at-risk group. Analysis of the nurses' characteristics      revealed that more nursing interventions were documented by those who were      younger, less experienced, and more educated. CONCLUSION: A standardized      nursing-terminology-based electronic nursing record system allowed us to monitor       the variations in nursing practice with regard to preventive pressure-ulcer care       in intensive-care patients with and at risk of pressure ulcers. We found that      pressure-ulcer prevention care was provided at frequencies much lower than the      recommended guidelines. Further studies on identifying the factors affecting      pressure-ulcer prevention care and ways to improve the quality of that care are      needed.

PMID- 21115393   - PURPOSE: The implementation of an information system has become a trend in      healthcare institutions. How to identify variables related to patient safety      among accumulated data has been viewed as a main issue. The purpose of this study      was to identify critical factors related to patient falls through the application      of data mining to available data through a hospital information system. METHOD:      Data on a total of 725 patient falls were obtained from a web-based nursing      incident reporting system at a medical center in Taiwan. In the process of data      mining, feature selection was applied as the first step, after which 10 critical       factors were selected to predict the dependent variables (injury versus      non-injury). An artificial neural network (ANN) analysis was applied to develop a      predictive model and a multivariate stepwise logistic regression was performed      for comparison purposes. RESULTS: The ANN model produced the following results: a      Receiver-Operating-Character (ROC) curve indicated 77% accuracy, the positive      predictive value (PPV) was 68%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 72%;       while the multivariate stepwise logistic regression only identified 3 variables      (fall assessment, anti-psychosis medication and diuretics) as significant      predictors with ROC curve of 42%, PPV of 26.24%, and NPV of 87.12%. CONCLUSION:      In addition to medication use such as anti-psychotic and diuretics, nursing      intervention where a fall assessment is conducted could represent a critical      factor related to outcomes of fall incidence.

PMID- 21115392   - OBJECTIVES: To assess the changes in the quality of information processing in      nursing after the introduction of a computer-based nursing information system.      METHODS: 94 nurses filled out the HIS-monitor survey, comprising 41 questions and      focusing on the quality of the information processing, shortly before and again      one year after the introduction of a computer-based nursing information system. A      McNemar-Bowker-test was used to assess the changes in quality over time. The      HIS-monitor instrument was formally validated by calculating Cronbach Alpha.      RESULTS: Despite some technical problems, the quality of the information      processing in nursing significantly improved after the introduction of a      computer-based nursing information system in many areas. The results show      improved support during patient anamnesis and care planning, higher availability       and completeness of nursing documentation, better overview on the patient, better     readability of nursing documentation, reduction of duplicate documentation,      better workflow support with task lists and checklists, and better fulfillment of      the legal regulations. The results with regard to time efforts for nursing      documentation and the related impact on patient care were mixed, however. Most of      the expectations of the nurses that were stated before IT introduction seem to      have been realized. CONCLUSIONS: The HIS-monitor was found to be a useful      instrument, in turn showing that the quality of the information processing in      nursing strongly increased after the introduction of a nursing information      system.

PMID- 21115391   - INTRODUCTION: Clinical pathways (CPs) have been evaluated with regard to process       optimization, economic effects, quality of care, patient satisfaction and staff      satisfaction. IT- (information technology) supported CPs, integrated within the      HIS (hospital information system), have been implemented in our department in      2004 for the first time world-wide. Herein, we describe the effect of this new      concept on medical staff satisfaction. METHODS: A prospective anonymous and      voluntary survey with standardized questionnaires was performed annually from      2006 until 2009 evaluating staff satisfaction concerning CPs. Questions comprised      satisfaction with the software, staff's attitude towards CPs and the impact of      CPs on work-related processes. RESULTS: Within the observation period the term      "clinical pathways" became more common among doctors and nurses. Knowledge of the      aims of CPs increased significantly in nursing staff (43.4-74.5%), whereas      doctor's knowledge was on a constant high level. Standardization, process      facilitation and cost effectiveness were the most claimed goals of CPs.      Comprehensibility of the single steps within CPs was on a constant high level      over the observation period. Generally, graphical layout and usability of CPs      ranged on a very high satisfaction level. Acceptability of IT-supported CPs is      independent from staffs computer knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Staff satisfaction with       IT-supported CPs needs to take into account the job characteristics of the      different professional groups. IT-supported CPs are leading to a high staff      satisfaction, the aims of CPs are widely understood by medical employees.      IT-supported CPs may ameliorate staff satisfaction and thereby enhance workflow      efficiencies.

PMID- 21112244   - PURPOSE: Public engagement with eHealth is generally viewed as beneficial.      However, despite the potential benefits, public engagement with eHealth services       remains variable. This article explores reasons for this variability through a      review of published international literature. METHODS: A focused search,      conducted in January 2009, of three bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, CINAHL and       EMBASE, returned 2622 unique abstracts. RESULTS: Fifty articles met the inclusion      criteria for the review. Four main types of eHealth service were identified:      health information on the Internet; custom-made online health information; online      support; and telehealth. Public engagement with these services appears to depend       on a number of factors: characteristics of users; technological issues;      characteristics of eHealth services; social aspects of use; and eHealth services       in use. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for policy makers, developers, users and      health professionals, include: targeting efforts towards those underserved by      eHealth; improving access; tailoring services to meet the needs of a broader     range of users; exploiting opportunities for social computing; and clarifying of       the role of health professionals in endorsement, promotion and facilitation.

PMID- 21112243   - INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have demonstrated that e-prescribing takes longer     than handwriting. Additional studies documenting the perceived efficiencies      realized from e-prescribing from those who have implemented electronic      prescribing are warranted. METHODS: We used a mixed method study design. We      report on qualitative date from 64 focus groups with clinicians and office staff       from six US states. Participants used one of six e-prescribing software packages.      Qualitative data from the focus groups (276 participants) were coded and analyzed      using NVivo software. Quantitative data regarding perceived efficiencies were      extracted from a survey of 157 clinicians using e-prescribing. RESULTS:      Perceptions of e-prescribing included 64% reporting e-prescribing as very      efficient. The next closest method was computer generated fax and prescriptions      in which approximately 25% rated the method as very efficient. Improvements in      workflow and record keeping were noted. Perceived efficiencies were realized by      decreased errors, availability of formularies at the point of prescribing and      refill processing. Perceived inefficiencies noted included the need for dual      systems owing to regulations preventing e-prescribing of scheduled medications as      well as those introduced with incorrect information on formularies, pharmacy      used, and warnings. DISCUSSION: Overwhelmingly, clinicians and their staff      confirmed the perceived efficiencies realized with the adoption of e-prescribing.      Perceived efficiencies were realized in knowing formularies, processing refills,       and decreasing errors. Opportunities to improve efficiencies could be realized by      assuring correct information in the system.

PMID- 21112242   - Errors involving medication administration can be costly, both in financial and      in human terms. Indeed, there is much potential for errors due to the complexity       of the medication administration process. Nurses are often singled out as the      only responsible of these errors because they are in charge of drug      administration. Nevertheless, the interventions of every actor involved in the      process and the system design itself contribute to errors (Wakefield et al.      (1998). Proper inpatient medication safety systems can help to reduce such errors      in hospitals. In this paper, we review in depth two recent proposals (Chien et      al. (2010); Huang and Ku (2009)) that pursue the aforementioned objective.      Unfortunately, they fail in their attempt mainly due to their security faults but      interesting ideas can be drawn from both. These security faults refer to      impersonation and replay attacks that could produce the generation of a forged      proof stating that certain medication was administered to an inpatient when it      was not. We propose a leading-edge solution to enhance inpatient medication      safety based on RFID technology that overcomes these weaknesses. Our solution,      named Inpatient Safety RFID system (IS-RFID), takes into account the Information       Technology (IT) infrastructure of a hospital and covers every phase of the drug      administration process. From a practical perspective, our system can be easily      integrated within hospital IT infrastructures, has a moderate cost, is very ease       to use and deals with security aspects as a key point.

PMID- 21093355   - OBJECTIVE: Near real-time disease detection using electronic data sources is a      public health priority. Detecting pneumonia is particularly important because it       is the manifesting disease of several bioterrorism agents as well as a      complication of influenza, including avian and novel H1N1 strains. Text radiology      reports are available earlier than physician diagnoses and so could be integral      to rapid detection of pneumonia. We performed a pilot study to determine which      keywords present in text radiology reports are most highly associated with      pneumonia diagnosis. DESIGN: Electronic radiology text reports from 11 hospitals       from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 were used. We created a      computerized algorithm that searched for selected keywords ("airspace disease",      "consolidation", "density", "infiltrate", "opacity", and "pneumonia"),      differentiated between clinical history and radiographic findings, and accounted       for negations and double negations; this algorithm was tested on a sample of 350       radiology reports. We used the algorithm to study 189,246 chest radiographs,      searching for the keywords and determining their association with a final      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification      (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis of pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Performance of the search      algorithm in finding keywords, and association of the keywords with a pneumonia      diagnosis. RESULTS: In the sample of 350 radiographs, the search algorithm was      highly successful in identifying the selected keywords (sensitivity 98.5%,      specificity 100%). Analysis of the 189,246 radiographs showed that the keyword      "pneumonia" was the strongest predictor of an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of pneumonia      (adjusted odds ratio 11.8) while "density" was the weakest (adjusted odds ratio      1.5). In general, the most highly associated keyword present in the report,      regardless of whether a less highly associated keyword was also present, was the       best predictor of a diagnosis of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Empirical methods may      assist in finding radiology report keywords that are most highly predictive of a       pneumonia diagnosis.

PMID- 21075676   - PURPOSE: E-health enables the sharing of patient-related data whenever and      wherever necessary. Electronic health records (EHRs) promise to improve      communication between health care providers, thus leading to better quality of      patients' treatment and reduced costs. However, as highly sensitive patient      information provides a promising goal for attackers and is also frequently      demanded by insurance companies and employers, there is increasing social and      political pressure regarding the prevention of health data misuse. This work      addresses this problem and introduces a methodology that protects health records       from unauthorized access and lets the patient as data owner decide who the      authorized persons are, i.e., who the patient discloses her health information      to. Therefore, the methodology prevents data disclosure that negatively      influences the patient's life (e.g., by being denied health insurance or     employment). METHODS: This research uses a combination of conceptual-analytical,       artifact-building and artifact-evaluating research approaches. The article starts      with a detailed exploration of existing privacy protection mechanisms, such as      encryption, anonymization and pseudonymization, by comparing and analyzing      related work (conceptual-analytical approach). Based on these results and the      identified shortcomings, a pseudonymization methodology is defined and evaluated       by means of a threat analysis. Finally, the research results are validated with      the design and implementation of a prototype (artifact building and artifact      evaluation). RESULTS: This paper presents a new methodology for the      pseudonymization of medical data that stores health data decoupled from the      corresponding patient-identifying information, allowing privacy-preserving      secondary use of the health records in clinical studies without additional      anonymization steps. In contrast to clinical studies, where it is not necessary      to identify the individual participants, insurance companies and employers are      interested in the health status of individuals such as potential insurance or job      applicants. In this case, pseudonymized records are practically useless for these      parties as the patient controls who is able to reestablish the link between      health records and patient for primary use - usually only trusted health care      providers. CONCLUSIONS: The framework provides health care providers with a      unique solution that guarantees data privacy (e.g., according to HIPAA) and      allows primary and secondary use of the data at the same time. The security      analysis showed that the methodology is secure and protected against common      intruder scenarios.

PMID- 21075675   - To ensure that patient confidentiality is securely maintained, health ICT      applications that contain sensitive personal information demand comprehensive      privacy policies. Determining the adequacy of these policies to meet legal      conformity together with clinical users and patient expectation is demanding in      practice. Organisations and agencies looking to analyse their Privacy and      Security policies can benefit from guidance provided by outside entities such as       the Privacy Office of their State or Government together with law firms and ICT      specialists. The advice given is not uniform and often open to different      interpretations. Of greater concern is the possibility of overlooking any      important aspects that later result in a data breach. Based on three case      studies, this paper considers whether a more formal approach to privacy analysis       could be taken that would help identify the full coverage of a Privacy Impact      Analysis and determine the deficiencies with an organisation's current policies      and approach. A diagrammatic model showing the relationships between      Confidentiality, Privacy, Trust, Security and Safety is introduced. First the      validity of this model is determined by mapping it against the real-world case      studies taken from three healthcare services that depend on ICT. Then, by using      software engineering methods, a formal mapping of the relationships is undertaken      to identify a full set of policies needed to satisfy the model. How effective      this approach may prove as a generic method for deriving a comprehensive set of      policies in health ICT applications is finally discussed.

PMID- 21067968   - PURPOSE: We investigate why clinicians experience problems interpreting      implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) data when the patient is absent, and      we explore how to re-introduce patients into the socio-technical setup of      telemonitored interpretation practices. METHOD: An action research study with a      design interventionist perspective was conducted to investigate the      telemonitoring arrangement for chronic heart patients with ICDs and to identify      the nature of the collaborative practices involved in ICD data interpretation. We      diagnose the main challenges involved in collaborative interpretation practices.       These insights were used to re-design the socio-technical setup of the      telemonitoring practices by designing and building a web-based, patient-centric,       collaborative application, myRecord, to re-introduce the patients as active      participants into the telemonitoring setup. Finally, we introduce myRecord at      Copenhagen University Hospital and evaluate the new practices and the      collaborative technology related to the transformed role of the patients.      RESULTS: The interpretation of ICD data is a collaborative practice engaging      clinicians and patients and involving three separate collaborative processes:      interpretation of numbers; interpretation of general condition; and patient's      interpretation of own condition and ICD data. In a collocated setup, these three       interpretation processes are entangled and seamlessly interrelated. However, in      the current telemonitoring setup, only the interpretation of numbers process is      fully supported, neglecting the two other processes, and, in particular, the role      of the patient. By re-introducing patients into the socio-technical setup of      telemonitoring through myRecord, our design acknowledges the collaborative nature      of the interpretation process. However, re-introducing patients transforms their       role, and leads to new transformed telemonitoring practices, different from both       the current telemonitoring setup as well as from the collocated setup.      CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring practices of patients with ICDs involve three      entangled collaborative processes, whereas the existing socio-technical setup      only mediate one. myRecord is designed as an add-on collaborative technology to      mediate the two remaining collaborative processes. We argue that myRecord solves       some of the problems with ICD data interpretation inherent in telemonitoring      practices by providing a collaborative, asynchronous space for healthcare      practitioners and patients to mediate the two processes that are otherwise lost.       Our new socio-technical design also transforms the role of patients considerably,      thus new studies should take these insights into consideration.

PMID- 21067967   - Telehealth is one of the more recent applications of ICT to health care. It      promises to be both cost-effective and efficient. However, there lies a danger     that focusing mainly on pragmatic considerations will ignore fundamental ethical       issues with legal implications that could undermine its success. Implicated here       are, among others, changes in the nature of the health care professional patient       relationship and informed consent, etc. The position of health informatics      professionals as well as hard- and software providers is also affected. A further     complicating factor is outsourcing. This paper identifies relevant issues and      outlines some of their implications.

PMID- 21055999   - PURPOSE: The purpose of our multidisciplinary study was to define a pragmatic and      secure alternative to the creation of a national centralised medical record which      could gather together the different parts of the medical record of a patient      scattered in the different hospitals where he was hospitalised without any risk      of breaching confidentiality. METHODS: We first analyse the reasons for the      failure and the dangers of centralisation (i.e. difficulty to define a European      patients' identifier, to reach a common standard for the contents of the medical       record, for data protection) and then propose an alternative that uses the      existing available data on the basis that setting up a safe though imperfect      system could be better than continuing a quest for a mythical perfect information      system that we have still not found after a search that has lasted two decades.      RESULTS: We describe the functioning of Medical Record Search Engines (MRSEs),      using pseudonymisation of patients' identity. The MRSE will be able to retrieve      and to provide upon an MD's request all the available information concerning a      patient who has been hospitalised in different hospitals without ever having      access to the patient's identity. The drawback of this system is that the medical      practitioner then has to read all of the information and to create his own      synthesis and eventually to reject extra data. CONCLUSIONS: Faced with the      difficulties and the risks of setting up a centralised medical record system, a      system that gathers all of the available information concerning a patient could      be of great interest. This low-cost pragmatic alternative which could be      developed quickly should be taken into consideration by health authorities.

PMID- 21051278   - OBJECTIVES: To assess, using complete polysomnography as the gold standard, the      capability of Heasys((R)), an innovative wireless bed monitoring assistance to      record body movements and presence and to infer bed-exit events and body position      changes at night. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTINGS: Sleep laboratory for     patient's recording and home for healthy volunteers. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve      patients referred for suspicion or treatment of sleep disordered breathing and 5       healthy subjects. MEASUREMENTS: Complete polysomnography was recorded during one       night in patients and during two nights in healthy volunteers. Heasys((R)) sheet       was placed under the fitted bed sheet to allow concomitant recording. During the       second night, healthy subjects were asked to get out of bed at least 2 times for       a minimal duration of 3 min. RESULTS: Heasys((R)) allowed the detection of all      bed-exit events in patients and volunteers (sensitivity: 100%, and specificity:      85%). When bed-exit events were defined by the lack of the presence signal      combined with absence of motion and a dip in temperature, sensitivity and      specificity of Heasys((R)) were 92 and 100%, respectively. In patients and      volunteers, Heasys((R)) detected body position changes recorded by      polysomnography respectively, in 84 and 98% of the cases. Additional recorded      motions were mainly related to leg movements or arousals. CONCLUSION: In this      small feasibility study, Heasys((R)) seemed to be an effective innovative device       allowing bed-exit events detection in adult patients and healthy volunteers.

PMID- 21041113   - Patients' medical data have been originally generated and maintained by health      professionals in several independent electronic health records (EHRs).      Centralized electronic health records accumulate medical data of patients to      improve their availability and completeness; EHRs are not tied to a single      medical institution anymore. Nowadays enterprises with the capacity and knowledge      to maintain this kind of databases offer the services of maintaining EHRs and      adding personal health data by the patients. These enterprises get access on the       patients' medical data and act as a main point for collecting and disclosing      personal data to third parties, e.g. among others doctors, healthcare service      providers and drug stores. Existing systems like Microsoft HealthVault and Google      Health comply with data protection acts by letting the patients decide on the      usage and disclosure of their data. But they fail in satisfying essential      requirements to privacy. We propose a privacy-protecting information system for     controlled disclosure of personal data to third parties. Firstly, patients should      be able to express and enforce obligations regarding a disclosure of health data       to third parties. Secondly, an organization providing EHRs should neither be able      to gain access to these health data nor establish a profile about patients.

PMID- 21036660   - The paradigm shift from organization-centered to managed care and on to personal       health settings increases specialization and distribution of actors and services       related to the health of patients or even citizens before becoming patients. As a      consequence, extended communication and cooperation is required between all      principals involved in health services such as persons, organizations, devices,      systems, applications, and components. Personal health (pHealth) environments      range over many disciplines, where domain experts present their knowledge by      using domain-specific terminologies and ontologies. Therefore, the mapping of      domain ontologies is inevitable for ensuring interoperability. The paper     introduces the care paradigms and the related requirements as well as an      architectural approach for meeting the business objectives. Furthermore, it      discusses some theoretical challenges and practical examples of ontologies,      concept and knowledge representations, starting general and then focusing on      security and privacy related services. The requirements and solutions for     empowering the patient or the citizen before becoming a patient are especially      emphasized.

PMID- 21036659   - PURPOSE: Electronic medical records (EMR) promise potential benefits for the      practice of medical care. However, individual technologies such as EMR must      interact with the work system as a whole - including people, technology and work       practices - to enable or hinder the coordination of dynamic work demands. Based      on this extended perspective, we address in this paper how support technologies      (should) impact the coordination of work across multiple agents, controlling a      dynamic domain with multiple, interacting processes. The technology we address is      the medical record and the dynamic domain is emergency medicine as it is      practiced in the U.S. METHOD: We performed 500 hours of naturalistic observations      of physicians in two different hospital emergency departments in the Midwestern      U.S differing in their reliance on paper or electronic medical records. RESULTS      AND CONCLUSIONS: An analysis of work practice across the two hospitals revealed      the role of medical records in facilitating or hindering the coordination of time      sensitive and context dependent distributed work, as well as the specific      influence of EMR. Recognizing that work practice compensates for the limitations       of technology, we suggest four requirements for the design of EMR to promote      workplace efficiency: facilitation of locally customized data presentations;      support for integration of hitherto fragmented record systems and data formats;      support for effective multi-user coordination of control tasks; and guidance for       standardizing a level of detail in planning and documenting care.

PMID- 21035383   - eHealth platform is the official federal network in Belgium (created by law on 21      August 2008) devoted to a secure exchange of health data in many types of      applications, such as health care purposes, simplification of administrative      procedures and contribution to health policy. It implies a controlled access to      decentralized databases and uses encrypted personal data. The national      identification number has been chosen in order to authenticate the requester, the      patient, and the receiver of information exchange. Authorizations have to be      respected in order to obtain personal health data. Several questions are raised      about its security: the lack of mandatory request for systematic journaling on      accesses to the electronic patient record as well as the absence of explicit      procedures for sanctions in case of unauthorized access, the new role of social      security administration in managing security where a eHealth manager can be both       judge and party (in the function of trusted third party for health data      encryption and of a required lawyer for texts proposed by physicians to the      Commission for the protection of private life). Another critic concerns the      number of physicians in minority and the absence of patients' delegates in the      eHealth Board. At a time when the patient is becoming a partner in the care team,      should not he be the gate-keeper for the access to his own health record? How      could networks help him to get the appropriate knowledge to contribute to care      and to write his testament of life? Recent laws (on private life, patient rights       and euthanasia) have contributed to a behavioural change in citizens and      physician attitudes. Recommendations are made in order to improve the      acceptability of eHealth platform.

PMID- 20974549   - PURPOSE: Effective interdisciplinary exchange of patient information is an      essential component of safe, efficient, and patient-centered care in the      intensive care unit (ICU). Frequent handoffs of patient care, high acuity of      patient illness, and the increasing amount of available data complicate      information exchange. Verbal communication can be affected by interruptions and      time limitations. To supplement verbal communication, many ICUs rely on      documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) to reduce errors of omission      and information loss. The purpose of this study was to develop a model of EHR     interdisciplinary information exchange of ICU common goals. METHODS: The      theoretical frameworks of distributed cognition and the clinical communication      space were integrated and a previously published categorization of verbal      information exchange was used. 59.5h of interdisciplinary rounds in a      neurovascular ICU were observed and five interviews and one focus group with ICU       nurses and physicians were conducted. RESULTS: Current documentation tools in the      ICU were not sufficient to capture the nurses' and physicians' collaborative      decision-making and verbal communication of goal-directed actions and      interactions. Clinicians perceived the EHR to be inefficient for information      retrieval, leading to a further reliance on verbal information exchange.      CONCLUSION: The model suggests that EHRs should support: (1) information tools      for the explicit documentation of goals, interventions, and assessments with      synthesized and summarized information outputs of events and updates; and (2)      messaging tools that support collaborative decision-making and patient safety      double checks that currently occur between nurses and physicians in the absence      of EHR support.

PMID- 20961803   - PURPOSE: Faced with an increasingly complex patient population and growing demand      for services, community health centers (CHCs) are recognizing that electronic      health records (EHRs) may help their efforts to improve efficiency in care      delivery. Yet little is known about the benefits, challenges, and specific      impacts of EHR implementation in the often resource-constrained CHC environment,       especially from users' perspectives. The objective of this study was to explore      EHR users' perspectives about the EHR implementation process and impact in a CHC       network. METHODS: We performed an exploratory case study following EHR     implementation in a multi-site, urban CHC network. Data were collected through      semi-structured interviews with 39 key informants across four sites. Key      informants included physicians, clinical staff and administrators. We used both      deductive and inductive approaches to code the transcribed interview data and to       identify themes in our analyses. RESULTS: A key theme that emerged involved      perceptions of efficiency related to the EHR implementation. While the EHR was      widely credited with improving the efficiency of several clinical processes      (e.g., lab ordering), it also created new challenges. Some of the early      efficiency challenges we identified were common to EHR implementation in general       (e.g., system interface issues), but others were unique to the CHC context (e.g.,      issues related to compliance with complex regulatory and reporting requirements).      Further, constrained organizational resources for training and ongoing IT support      were widely noted as challenges that may have exacerbated, or precluded early      resolution of, efficiency issues. While limited to a single CHC network, our     findings highlight important issues for CHCs to consider about EHRs. CONCLUSIONS:      These findings suggest that CHCs face difficult and often unique barriers related      to EHR implementation and use, and the resultant efficiency impacts should not be      overlooked.

PMID- 20951634   - INTRODUCTION: Efficient search for and finding drugs is essential for electronic       drug information systems which, for their part, are prerequisites for     computerized physician order entry systems and clinical decision support with the      potential to prevent medication errors. Search failures would be critical: they      may delay or even prohibit prescription processes or timely retrieval of vital      drug information. We analyzed spelling-correction and error characteristics in      drug searches and the suitability of auto-completion as prevention strategy.      METHODS: A blank entry field was presented to the user for unbiased queries in a       web-based drug information system containing >105,000 brand names and active      ingredients accessible from all 5500 computers of the Heidelberg University      Hospital. The system was equipped with an error-tolerant search. Misspelled but      found drug names confirmed by users were aligned by dynamic programming      algorithms, opposing misspelled and correct names letter by letter. We analyzed      the ratios of correctly and incorrectly spelled but found drugs, frequencies of      characters, and their position in misspelled search words. RESULTS: Without      error-tolerant search, no results were found in 17.5% of all queries. Users      confirmed 31% of all results found with phonetic error-correction support.      Sixteen percent of all spelling errors were letters in close proximity to the      correct letter on keyboards. On average, 7% of the initial letters in misspelled       words contained errors. CONCLUSION: Drug information systems should be equipped      with error-tolerant algorithms to reduce search failures. Drug initial letters      are also error-prone, thus auto-completion is not a sufficient error-prevention      strategy and needs additional support by error-tolerant algorithms.

PMID- 20951082   - PURPOSE: Medical records must often be stripped of patient identifiers, or     de-identified, before being shared. De-identification by humans is      time-consuming, and existing software is limited in its generality. The open      source MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) provides an environment to      support rapid tailoring of automated de-identification to different document      types, using automatically learned classifiers to de-identify and protect      sensitive information. METHODS: MIST was evaluated with four classes of patient      records from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center: discharge summaries,      laboratory reports, letters, and order summaries. We trained and tested MIST on      each class of record separately, as well as on pooled sets of records. We      measured precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy at the word level for the      detection of patient identifiers as designated by the HIPAA Safe Harbor Rule.      RESULTS: MIST was applied to medical records that differed in the amounts and      types of protected health information (PHI): lab reports contained only two types      of PHI (dates, names) compared to discharge summaries, which were much richer.      Performance of the de-identification tool depended on record class; F-measure      results were 0.996 for order summaries, 0.996 for discharge summaries, 0.943 for       letters and 0.934 for laboratory reports. Experiments suggest the tool requires      several hundred training exemplars to reach an F-measure of at least 0.9.      CONCLUSIONS: The MIST toolkit makes possible the rapid tailoring of automated      de-identification to particular document types and supports the transition of the      de-identification software to medical end users, avoiding the need for developers      to have access to original medical records. We are making the MIST toolkit      available under an open source license to encourage its application to diverse      data sets at multiple institutions.

PMID- 20951081   - PURPOSE: Clinicians are overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of new clinical      information that is available on a daily basis. Despite the availability of      information tools for finding this information and for updating clinical      knowledge, no study has examined the quality of current information alerting      services. METHODS: We developed a 7-item checklist based on the principles of      evidence-based medicine and assessed content validity with experts and face      validity with practicing clinicians and clinician researchers. A list of clinical      information updating tools (push tools) was generated in a systematic fashion and      the checklist was used to rate the quality of these tools by two independent      raters. Prior to rating all instruments, the raters were trained to achieve good       agreement (>80%) by applying the checklist to two sets of three randomly selected      tools. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the quality of the identified      tools and inter-rater reliability was assessed using Intraclass Correlation      (ICC). RESULTS: Eighteen tools were identified using our systematic search. The      average quality of these tools was 2.72 (range 0-7). Only two tools met all      suggested criteria for quality. Inter-rater reliability for the 7-item checklist       was .82 (ICC). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a checklist that can be used to reliably      assess the quality of clinical information updating tools. We found many      shortcomings in currently available clinical knowledge updating tools. Ideally,      these tools will evolve in the direction of applying basic evidence-based      medicine principles to new medical information in order to increase their     usefulness to clinicians.

PMID- 20951080   - BACKGROUND: In an era of short inpatient stays, residents may overlook relevant      elements of the differential diagnosis as they try to evaluate and treat      patients. However, if a resident's first principal diagnosis is wrong, the      patient's appropriate evaluation and treatment may take longer, cost more, and      lead to worse outcomes. A diagnostic decision support system may lead to the      generation of a broader differential diagnosis that more often includes the      correct diagnosis, permitting a shorter, more effective, and less costly hospital      stay. METHODS: We provided residents on General Medicine services access to      DXplain, an established computer-based diagnostic decision support system, for 6       months. We compared charges and cost of service for diagnostically challenging      cases seen during the fourth through sixth month of access to DXplain      (intervention period) to control cases seen in the 6 months before the system was      made available. RESULTS: 564 cases were identified as diagnostically challenging       by our criteria during the intervention period along with 1173 cases during the      control period. Total charges were $1281 lower (p=.006), Medicare Part A charges       $1032 lower (p=0.006) and cost of service $990 lower (p=0.001) per admission in      the intervention cases than in control cases. CONCLUSIONS: Using DXplain on all      diagnostically challenging cases might save our medical center over $2,000,000 a       year on the General Medicine Services alone. Using clinical diagnostic decision      support systems may improve quality and decrease cost substantially at teaching      hospitals.

PMID- 20947415   - CONTEXT: The promise of the electronic medical record (EMR) lies in its ability      to reduce the costs of health care delivery and improve the overall quality of      care--a promise that is realized through major changes in workflows within the      health care organization. Yet little systematic information exists about the      workflow effects of EMRs. Moreover, some of the research to-date points to      reduced satisfaction among physicians after implementation of the EMR and      increased time, i.e., negative workflow effects. A better understanding of the      impact of the EMR on workflows is, hence, vital to understanding what the      technology really does offer that is new and unique. OBJECTIVE: (i) To      empirically develop a physician centric conceptual model of the workflow effects       of EMRs; (ii) To use the model to understand the antecedents to the physicians'      workflow expectation from the new EMR; (iii) To track physicians' satisfaction      overtime, 3 months and 20 months after implementation of the EMR; (iv) To explore      the impact of technology learning curves on physicians' reported satisfaction      levels. DESIGN: The current research uses the mixed-method technique of concept      mapping to empirically develop the conceptual model of an EMR's workflow effects.      The model is then used within a controlled study to track physician expectations       from a new EMR system as well as their assessments of the EMR's performance 3      months and 20 months after implementation. SETTING: The research tracks the      actual implementation of a new EMR within the outpatient clinics of a large      northeastern research hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The pre-implementation survey      netted 20 physician responses; post-implementation Time 1 survey netted 22      responses, and Time 2 survey netted 26 physician responses. INTERVENTION: The      implementation of the actual EMR served as the intervention. Since the study was       conducted within the same setting and tracked a homogenous group of respondents,       the overall study design ensured against extraneous influences on the results.      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were derived empirically from the      conceptual model. They included 85 items that measured physician perceptions of      the EMR's workflow effect on the following eight issues: (1) administration, (2)       efficiency in patient processing, (3) basic clinical processes, (4) documentation      of patient encounter, (5) economic challenges and reimbursement, (6) technical      issues, (7) patient safety and care, and (8) communication and confidentiality.      The items were used to track expectations prior to implementation and they served      as retrospective measures of satisfaction with the EMR in post-implementation      Time 1 and Time 2. RESULTS: The findings suggest that physicians conceptualize      EMRs as an incremental extension of older computerized provider order entries      (CPOEs) rather than as a new innovation. The EMRs major functional advantages are      seen to be very similar to, if not the same as, those of CPOEs. Technology      learning curves play a statistically significant though minor role in shaping      physician perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: The physicians' expectations from the EMR are      based on their prior beliefs rather than on a rational evaluation of the EMR's      fit, functionality, or performance. Their decision regarding the usefulness of      the EMR is made very early, within the first few months of use of the EMR. These       early perceptions then remain stable and become the lens through which subsequent      experience with the EMR is interpreted. The findings suggest a need for     communication based interventions aimed at explaining the value, fit, and      usefulness of EMRs to physicians early in the pre- and immediate post-EMR     implementation stages.

PMID- 20889370   - INTRODUCTION: The provisions of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act      increased the likelihood of more widespread health information exchange (HIE),      the electronic transfer of patient-level information between organizations, by      essentially mandating the use of electronic health record systems. While      important, the sparse body of research on HIE efforts and anecdotal reports      indicate the barriers to HIE adoption and implementation include factors beyond      simply the presence or absence of a specific technology. METHODS: This paper     examines those technological, organizational, and environmental factors that are       associated with both HIE adoption and implementation in a sample of 4830 U.S.      hospitals. Factors associated with adoption and implementation were modeled using      random-intercept logistic regression. RESULTS: Consistent with a perspective that      adoption and implementation are different phenomena, many factors associated with      an increased odds of adoption, were unassociated with implementation and vice      versa. Non-profit status, public hospitals, more live and operation applications,      more emergency room visits, network membership, and the presence of physician      portals all increased hospitals' odds of HIE adoption. However, only network      membership increased the odds of HIE implementation, whereas competition      decreased those odds significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This study agreed with earlier     case-studies and anecdotal reports that factors beyond technology were important       to both adoption and implementation. While current U.S. policy on healthcare      information technology adoption focuses on technological barriers, many other     non-technological factors may ultimately hinder effective HIE.

PMID- 20884286   - OBJECTIVES: To conduct a review of reviews on the impacts and costs of      telemedicine services. METHODS: A review of systematic reviews of telemedicine      interventions was conducted. Interventions included all e-health interventions,      information and communication technologies for communication in health care,      Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if      important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients       with chronic conditions were considered relevant. Each potentially relevant      systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an external expert      team, using a revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and      Organisation of Care Group) to assess quality. Qualitative analysis of the      included reviews was informed by principles of realist review. RESULTS: In total       1593 titles/abstracts were identified. Following quality assessment, the review      included 80 heterogeneous systematic reviews. Twenty-one reviews concluded that      telemedicine is effective, 18 found that evidence is promising but incomplete and      others that evidence is limited and inconsistent. Emerging themes are the      particularly problematic nature of economic analyses of telemedicine, the      benefits of telemedicine for patients, and telemedicine as complex and ongoing      collaborative achievements in unpredictable processes. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence      of new topic areas in this dynamic field is notable and reviewers are starting to      explore new questions beyond those of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Reviewers       point to a continuing need for larger studies of telemedicine as controlled      interventions, and more focus on patients' perspectives, economic analyses and on      telemedicine innovations as complex processes and ongoing collaborative      achievements. Formative assessments are emerging as an area of interest.

PMID- 20869911   - PURPOSE: A key trade-off in computerized clinical documentation exists between      collecting coded data versus free-text. Coded data are more readily      computer-readable and easier to reuse in different contexts. However, clinical      information often exceeds the scope of commonly available terminologies, and      coding may be resisted by providers. Alert override reasons are one domain for     which agreed-upon terminologies are rarely used. Few data are available on how      the collection of information affects the responses of providers. METHODS: We      took advantage of a natural experiment and compared coded and uncoded reasons for     drug-drug interaction (DDI) alert overrides entered in two inpatient prescribing       systems with an identical DDI database but with one system offering coded reasons      and the other free-text entry. We only included alerts which were issued in both       sites and which physicians had to acknowledge. RESULTS: Over a one-year study      period, 15,636 alerts were issued. The reasons for override entered in the coded       approach matched the free-text site in only 46%. When using free-text, physicians      provided many reasons not among the coded options, and often reported that they      considered the alert inappropriate, including their rationale regarding this.      However, the information entered as free-text included many typing and spelling      errors, and the same concept was often represented in different ways, e.g. 209      different ways in which "will monitor as recommended" was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The      reasons for alert override vary substantially according to the data entry type,      which implies that data entry choice may lead to substantial distortion of the      underlying data.

PMID- 20869303   - OBJECTIVE: A rule-based prototype decision support tool; Braden-scale based      Automated Risk-assessment Tool (BART) was developed to test whether pressure      ulcer risk scores can be determined automatically based on the documented patient      data. METHODS: The data items required for assessing pressure ulcer risk were      identified by analyzing the parameter definitions of the Braden scale and by      consulting the nurses specialized in pressure ulcer prevention and care.      Documentation coverage and formats of the required data was evaluated. The      decision rules were developed based on the inputs from the expert nurses, and      were implemented as a web-based prototype tool, BART. The agreement rates between      nurses and BART on assigning scores to the six Braden-scale parameters were      calculated with 39 convenience samples of patient data. RESULTS: Although several      items required for the automated decision were not found from the documentation,       the majority of the required data items were documented with feasible formats      (i.e., coded lists or free text with nominal or numeric values) for algorithmic      processing. When evaluated with 39 test cases, BART and the nurses showed varying      levels of agreement (from "slight" to "substantial") on assigning scores for the       six parameters of the Braden scale. They showed "fair" level of agreement with an      "at risk" decision. CONCLUSION: BART has limitations that need to be addressed      through future enhancements. However, it demonstrates potential for reuse of      documented patient data to automatically populate pressure ulcer risk using the      Braden scale.

PMID- 20863752   - PURPOSE: Electronic software packages to support patient tracking and disposition      decision making in emergency departments (EDs) are being considered for     implementation in many hospitals. We compared extent of use, information      accuracy, and functions of manual and electronic patient status boards at 2 EDs      where both were continuously in use. METHODS: Ethnographic observations were      conducted at 2 Veterans Affairs Medical Center Emergency Departments using both      manual and electronic patient status boards (100 h, 9 physicians at Site 1; 64 h,      14 physicians at Site 2). Data included board information collected at 20-min      intervals, observable behavior while using boards, and interviews. RESULTS: Few      physicians (3/9 [33%] Site 1; 0/14 [0%] Site 2) used the e-board, whereas all      physicians used the whiteboards. Whiteboards had fewer inaccuracies (6/462 [1%]      Site 1; 21/864 [3%] Site 2) than e-boards (62/462 [13%] Site 1; 107/864 [12%]      Site 2). The primary functions of the whiteboard were to track real-time changes       to patient identifiers, locations, nursing assignments, and pending activities;      facilitate patient handoffs; inform physicians and nurses about newly arrived      patients assigned to them; inform nurses of physicians' orders; and inform      physicians of the status of ordered items. The primary functions of the e-board      were to support electronic data entry (by clerks) of patient admitting and      departure times; and highlight patients who had been in the ED for longer than 6       h. CONCLUSIONS: Whiteboards were more extensively used and had greater     information accuracy than e-boards. Nevertheless, e-boards provided functionality      not easily achievable with whiteboards.

PMID- 20833104   - OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of predefined order sets on the efficiency of      computerized medication ordering, and to analyze the effect of different types of      usability problems on ordering efficiency. METHODS: Crossover study to comparing       the efficiency of two methods of ordering (with and without use of predefined      order sets) in a laboratory setting using a computerized physician order entry      system (CPOE). The excess number of mouse clicks and keystrokes (the difference      in number of mouse clicks and keystrokes needed by each physician and the      minimally required numbers to accomplish the ordering tasks) for each method was       measured and per physician, occurrences of usability problems during the task      sessions were recorded. Observed usability problems were categorized using Zhang       et al.'s heuristic principles of good user interface design. The effect of      different types of usability problems on the excess number of mouse clicks and      keystrokes was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The median excess number of mouse      clicks and keystrokes needed by physicians was 6.2 times lower in the method with      predefined order sets (p<0.01). The excess number of mouse clicks and keystrokes       was significantly increased by vague and erroneous system messages with a factor       of 2.62 (95% CI 2.24-3.07), the use of unfamiliar language and terminology by a      factor of 1.28 (95% CI 1.14-1.43), and non-informative system feedback by a      factor of 1.15 (95% CI 1.03-1.28), respectively. Other categories of usability      problems had little influence on ordering efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Predefined      order sets can improve the efficiency of computerized ordering by reducing the      excess number of mouse clicks and keystrokes. However, the efficiency of      computerized ordering can be significantly impaired by usability problems due to       vague and incorrect system messages, unfamiliar language, and non-informative      system feedback.

PMID- 20829102   - PURPOSE: In the context of CPOE of standardized antineoplastic drugs, the      objectives of the present study were to determine the incidence of prescribing      medication errors (PME) and to analyse PME related to antineoplastic treatment in      university teaching hospitals. METHODS: All consecutive prescribing medication      orders over 1 year were analysed prospectively. Potential clinical impact was      quoted according to the Hatoum scale and risk factors identified with a      logistic-regression model. RESULTS: A total of 14,854 prescriptions were      analysed. The PME incidence was estimated at 1.5% [1.3-1.7], i.e. 15 errors per     1000 prescribing medication orders, with a significant or very significant      potential clinical impact in 62.9% of cases. Potentially death-threatening events      were avoided in 3.7% of cases. Overall, PME incidence related to significant,      very significant or vital potential clinical impact was estimated to be 1.0%      [0.8-1.2], i.e. 10 errors per 1000 prescribing medication orders. The most common      type of error was related to antineoplastic drug dosage (61.0%): inadequate      adaptation (43.1%), not taking alarms into account (16.1%), incorrect weight      (0.9%), incorrect unit (0.9%). More than 20% of PME are medication errors      directly linked to the prescribing medication order (choice of antineoplastic      treatment, double-prescribing medication order, forgotten or not validated by a      resident or senior physician). Occasional users of the CPOE system and resident      physicians were identified as main PME risk factors. CONCLUSION: An epidemiologic      survey of PME in the context of the use of a partial CPOE has allowed to      determine the incidence and epidemiology of PME as well as the potential clinical      impact they represent. Two risk factors have emerged that can be considered from       an organization and software points of view. Better pharmacist's analysis of      prescribing medication order within the CPOE system could possibly minimize      duplication of antineoplasic drugs and the vital clinical impact associated with       overdosage.

PMID- 20810307   - BACKGROUND: Internet is the common way to access all kind of information, thus it      becomes to have highly influential place on the range of health care as well.      More and more people have been using Internet to get the latest information on      the health-related matters. However, it is very important but not easy to find      the correct data and select it efficiently among the enormous amount of      information. To identify the information seekers and understand their needs or     purposes, they would be very effective for the providers to give high-quality      health information for the Internet users. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study       is to reveal the patterns of utilization of health information on the Internet.      The subjects of the survey were randomly selected among the local residents by      their age and gender. It was conducted in Gangwon, the province and Incheon, the       metropolitan city at the same time. To investigate the similar amount of      population, 0.5% of Gangwon and 0.3% of Incheon dwellers were chosen. METHODS:      10,325 people were responded to the telephone poll and the investigation had been      conducted from July to October 2006. 8656 from 10,325 completed the survey and      1665 (19.2%) of them had used Internet to get health information in last 1-year.       The use of health information on the Internet was classified into four categories      as follows: general health tips, disease specific information, shopping for     health commodities, and selection of hospitals. The questionnaire included      articles regarding socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income,      education, dwelling area, health status and behaviors such as cigarette smoking      and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Of all 1665 respondents, 726 (17.2%) men (total      4210) and 939 (21.1%) women (total 4446) had used Internet for health information      in last 1-year. The health information that people wanted from Internet was as      follows: general health tips (64.2%), disease specific information (32.0%),      shopping for health commodities (23.7%), and selection of hospitals (19.3%). The       people of higher education and higher income level tended to use Internet more      often for health information. Metropolitan city dwellers used health information       on the Internet more than people from province did. Personal health status      appeared to be the most important factor to search the information about general       health tips from the Internet. Healthy people (68.3%) used the Internet more than      people with diseases (44.4%) who used Internet most frequently for disease      specific information (62.6%). Residence area was the most important factor of      online shopping for health commodities. While 31.8% of city dwellers used the      Internet, only 19.0% of metropolitan or county dwellers used it for the same      purpose. Determinant factors for the utilization of the Internet for hospital      selection were residence area, age, and health examination. CONCLUSIONS: We found      that each section of health information has its own clients concerning their     personal interests and status of health and life style. That is why customized      market segmentation is strongly recommended for their loyal customers. Depends on      the information seekers' health status, it should be decided which information      would be more useful for them between general health tips and specific disease.      On the other hand, the area where the information seekers live can be more      influential on terms of shopping for health commodities. These results will be a       great help to start to understand the closer atmosphere of the ideal health      information market to provide more valuable services in more various use.

PMID- 20732829   - PURPOSE: Modern teaching concepts for undergraduate medical students in Germany      include problem based learning as a major component of the new licensing      regulations for physicians. Here we describe the usage of a web-based virtual      outpatient clinic in the teaching curriculum of undergraduate medical students,      its effect on learning success, and student reception. METHODS: Fifth year medial      students were requested to examine 7 virtual orthopaedic patients which had been       created by the authors using the Inmedea-Simulator. They also had to take a      multiple-choice examination on two different occasions and their utilisation of      the simulator was analysed subjectively and objectively. RESULTS: One hundred and      sixty students took part in the study. The average age was 24.9 years, 60% were      female. Most of the participants studied on their own using their private      computer with a fast internet-connection at home. The average usage time was 263       min, most of the students worked with the system in the afternoon, although a      considerable number used it late in the night. Regarding learning success, we      found that the examination results were significantly better after using the      system (7.66 versus 8.37, p<0.0001). Eighty percent of the students enjoyed      dealing with the virtual patients emphasizing the completeness of patient cases,       the artistic graphic design and the expert comments available, as well as the      good applicability to real cases. Eighty-seven percent of the students graded the      virtual orthopaedic clinic as appropriate to teach orthopaedic content.      CONCLUSION: Using the Inmedea-Simulator is an effective method to enhance      students' learning efficacy. The way the system was used by the students      emphasises the advantages of the internet-like free time management and the      implementation of multimedia-based content.

PMID- 20727819   - PURPOSE: This paper presents the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions      promoting the use of clinical information retrieval technologies (CIRTs) by      healthcare professionals. METHODS: We electronically searched articles published       between January 1990 and March 2008 using following inclusion criteria: (1)      participants were healthcare professionals; (2) specific intervention promoted      CIRT adoption; (3) studies were randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical      trials, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series analyses;       and (4) they objectively reporting measured outcomes on CIRT use. RESULTS: We      found nine studies focusing on CIRT use. Main outcomes measured were searching      skills and/or frequency of use of electronic databases by healthcare      professionals. Three studies reported a positive effect of the intervention on      CIRT use, one showed a positive impact post-intervention, and four studies failed      to demonstrate significant intervention effect. The ninth study examined      financial disincentives, and found a significant negative effect of introducing      user fees for searching MEDLINE in clinical settings. A meta-analysis showed that      educational meetings were the only type of interventions reporting consistent      positive effects on CIRT adoption. CONCLUSION: CIRT is an information and      communication technology commonly used in healthcare settings. Interventions      promoting CIRT adoption by healthcare professionals have shown some success in      improving searching skills and use of electronic databases. However, the      effectiveness of these interventions remains uncertain and more rigorous studies       are needed.

PMID- 20727818   - PURPOSE: Retinal image analysis can lead to early detection of several      pathologies such as hypertension or diabetes. Screening processes require the      evaluation of a high amount of visual data and, usually, the collaboration      between different experts and different health care centers. These usual routines      demand new fast and automatic solutions to deal with these situations. This work       introduces Sirius (System for the Integration of Retinal Images Understanding      Services), a web-based system for image analysis in the retinal imaging field.      METHODS: Sirius provides a framework for ophthalmologists or other experts in the      field to collaboratively work using retinal image-based applications in a      distributed, fast and reliable environment. Sirius consists of three main      components: the web client that users interact with, the web application server     that processes all client requests and the service module that performs the image      processing tasks. In this work, we present a service for the analysis of retinal       microcirculation using a semi-automatic methodology for the computation of the      arteriolar-to-venular ratio (AVR). RESULTS: Sirius has been evaluated in      different real environments, involving health care systems, to test its      performance. First, the AVR service was validated in terms of precision and      efficiency and then, the framework was evaluated in different real scenarios of      medical centers. CONCLUSIONS: Sirius is a web-based application providing a fast       and reliable work environment for retinal experts. The system allows the sharing       of images and processed results between remote computers and provides automated      methods to diminish inter-expert variability in the analysis of the images.

PMID- 20685159   - BACKGROUND: The medical institutions had paid attention to the medication error     via Bar-Code Medication Administration system (BCMA) to improve the accuracy of      the medication process for patient safety. Yet, the working time of drug delivery      was under investigated. OBJECTIVES: Comparing the working time of oral drugs      between Bar-Code Medication Administration system and traditional medication      administration system. METHODS: Purposive sampling, observational and      questionnaire study design was used. Participants were invited from a medical      center in North Taiwan, 51 nurses from three neurosurgical wards who were using      the BCMA system; 51 nurses from three neurological wards who were using      traditional medication administration record (MAR). The working time of oral      medication administration including order transcribing, verifying, drug giving,      and renew in BCMA and traditional group were observed and recorded. RESULTS: (1)       Working time for oral medication administration reduced from 36.49 to 18.42 s      after BCMA implementation. (2) In the same period, working times for oral drug      administration were 62.89 and 56.07 s before and after BCMA implementation in the      traditional group. (3) Most nurses (66.7%) felt BCMA could save their oral drug      administration time under 50%. (4) Frequent crash of the wireless network, which       extended the oral drug administration time was the major threat in the process of      BCMA implementation. (5) 93.5% nurses think that BCMA could enhance patient oral       medication safety and promote quality of oral medication. CONCLUSIONS: The      results demonstrated that implementation of BCMA for oral medication could reduce      half of the time for oral medication delivery. Nurses coordinated the hardware      and software by accommodating the new facilities and operating BCMA system. The      stability of wireless Internet was the main threat. However, 93.5% nurses think      that BCMA could enhance patient oral medication safety in spite of making more      effort in learning new technology.

PMID- 20684890   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate whether nurses      have documented patient care in compliance with the national nursing      documentation model in electronic health records, which means the use of the      nursing process and the use of standardized terminology in different phases of      the nursing process. METHODS: The data were collected from a central hospital in       2003-2006. The data consist of the electronic nursing care plans of 67      neurological patients and 422 surgical patients. The data were analyzed using      statistical methods and content analysis. RESULTS: Standardized electronic      nursing documentation is based on the nursing process, although the use of the      nursing process varies across patients. There is a lack of progress notes      relating to needs assessment, the identification of nursing diagnoses and care      aims, and the nursing interventions planned in the documentation. The      standardized terminology is used in the documentation but inconsistencies emerge       in the use of the different classifications. CONCLUSION: The national model for     electronic nursing documentation is suitable for the documentation of patient      care in nursing care plans. However, health care professionals need further     training in documenting patient care according to the nursing process, and in      using the terminology in order to increase patient safety and improve      documentation.

PMID- 20655276   - PURPOSE: In 2005, an innovative system of hospital-community on-line medical      records (OFEK) was implemented at Clalit Health Services (CHS). The goals of the       study were to examine the extent of OFEK's use and its impact on quality      indicators and medical-service utilization in Internal Medicine and General      Surgery wards of CHS hospitals. METHODS: Examining the frequency of OFEK's use      with its own track-log data; comparing, "before" and "after", quality indicators       and service utilization data in experimental (CHS patients) versus control groups      (other patients). RESULTS: OFEK's use increased by tens of percentages each year,      Internal Medicine wards showed a significant decrease in the number of laboratory      tests and 3 CT tests performed compared with the control group. Wards using OFEK       extensively showed a greater decrease in CT tests, in one imaging test, and in      the average number of ambulatory hospitalizations. No similar changes were found       in General Surgery wards. CONCLUSIONS: The study helps evaluate the extent to      which OFEK's targets were achieved and contributes to the development of measures      to examine the impact of such systems, which can be used to assess a broad range       of Health Information Technology (HIT) systems.

PMID- 20621553   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are several cost-benefit evaluations of introducing      new technology for administrative purposes in the health care sector. Whereas      some of these recognise the importance of adapting the working procedures to the       new technology, very few look into the consequences of delays in adaptation to      the new technology. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of keeping old      working procedures, although new technology is implemented. METHODS: Based on      on-site observations we have estimated the economic gains of implementing      electronic message exchange in the health care sector depending on which working       procedures are applied. Then we continue by using a dynamic cost-benefit analysis      (CBA) in order to take into account that conversion to new working procedures      takes place over time, and we demonstrate the loss in potential gains due to such      a delay. RESULTS: Keeping working procedures fit to old technology when new      technology is implemented may imply that only between 40 and 50% of the potential      time savings (benefits) are realised. In a dynamic perspective, the keeping of      double procedures for 10 years and more will jeopardise the economic gains for     surgeries, whereas hospitals still may have an economic gain. The delay in      conversion to new working procedures implies that only 50% of the dynamic net      present value of the gains is realised. The longer it takes before the old      procedures are abandoned the lower is the dynamic net present value of the gains.      This is due to the discounting of future gains. CONCLUSIONS: These are all      arguments for emphasising and putting resources into training and motivation      programs for employees when new technology is being implemented. LIMITATIONS OF      THE STUDY: We have only considered quantifiable effects of electronic message      exchange in the health care sector, and only for hospitals and surgeries.

PMID- 20620098   - BACKGROUND: In 2000 the Korean government initiated efforts to secure healthcare       accessibility and efficiency anytime and anywhere via the nationwide healthcare      information system by the end of 2010. According to the master plan, electronic      health record (EHR) research and development projects were designed in 2005. One       subproject was the design and implementation of standards-based interoperable      clinical decision support (CDS) capabilities in the context of the EHR system.      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the challenges, process, and      outcomes of defining and implementing a national CDS architecture to stimulate      and motivate the widespread adoption of CDS services in Korea. METHODS: CDS      requirements and design principles were established by conducting a selective      literature review and a survey of clinicians, managers, and hospital and      industrial health information technology engineers regarding issues related to      CDS architectures. The previous relevant works of the American Medical      Informatics Association, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems      Society, and Health Level Seven were used to validate the scope and themes of the      service architecture. The Arden Syntax, Standards-Based Sharable Active Guideline      Environment, First DataBank, and SEBASTIAN approaches were used to assess the      coverage of the application architecture thus defined. A CDS prototype of an      outpatient hypertension management system was implemented and assessed in a      simulated experimental setting to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed      architecture. RESULTS: Four CDS service features were identified: knowledge      application, knowledge management, audit and evaluation, and CDS and knowledge      governance. Five core components of CDS application architecture were also      identified: knowledge-execution component, knowledge-authoring component,      data-interface component, knowledge repository, and service-interface component.       The coverage and characteristics of the architecture identified herein were found      to be comparable with those described previously. Two scenarios of deployment      architecture were identified in the context of Korean healthcare. The preliminary      feasibility test revealed that the architecture exhibited good performance and      made it easy to integrate patient data. CONCLUSION: We have described the efforts      that have been made to realize CDS service features, core components,      application, and deployment architectures in the context of the Korean EHR. These      outcomes showed the potential to contribute to the adoption of CDS at the      national level.

PMID- 20617569   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe and evaluate whether nurses      have documented patient care in compliance with the national nursing      documentation model in electronic health records, which means the use of the      nursing process and the use of standardized terminology in different phases of      the nursing process. METHODS: The data were collected from a central hospital in       2003-2006. The data consist of the electronic nursing care plans of 67      neurological patients and 422 surgical patients. The data were analyzed using      statistical methods and content analysis. RESULTS: Standardized electronic      nursing documentation is based on the nursing process, although the use of the      nursing process varies across patients. There is a lack of progress notes      relating to needs assessment, the identification of nursing diagnoses and care      aims, and the nursing interventions planned in the documentation. The      standardized terminology is used in the documentation but inconsistencies emerge       in the use of the different classifications. CONCLUSION: The national model for     electronic nursing documentation is suitable for the documentation of patient      care in nursing care plans. However, health care professionals need further     training in documenting patient care according to the nursing process, and in      using the terminology in order to increase patient safety and improve      documentation.

PMID- 20617546   - PURPOSE: Low health literacy has been associated with poor health-related      outcomes. The purposes are to report the development of a website for     low-literate parents in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and the findings      of heuristic evaluation and a usability testing of this website. METHODS: To      address low literacy of NICU parents, multimedia educational Website using visual      aids (e.g., pictographs, photographs), voice-recorded text message in addition to      a simplified text was developed. The text was created at the 5th grade      readability level. The heuristic evaluation was conducted by three usability      experts using 10 heuristics. End-users' performance was measured by counting the       time spent completing tasks and number of errors, as well as recording users'      perception of ease of use and usefulness (PEUU) in a sample of 10 NICU parents.      RESULTS: Three evaluators identified 82 violations across the 10 heuristics. All       violations, however, received scores <2, indicating minor usability problems.      Participants' time to complete task varies from 81.2 s (SD = 30.9) to 2.2 s (SD =      1.3). Participants rated the Website as easy to use and useful (PEUU mean = 4.52,      SD = 0.53). Based on the participants' comments, appropriate modifications were      made. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Different types of visuals on the Website were       well accepted by low-literate users and agreement of visuals with text improved      understanding of the educational materials over that with text alone. The      findings suggest that using concrete and realistic pictures and pictographs with       clear captions would maximize the benefit of visuals. One emerging theme was      "simplicity" in design (e.g., limited use of colors, one font type and size),      content (e.g., avoid lengthy text), and technical features (e.g., limited use of       pop-ups). The heuristic evaluation by usability experts and the usability test      with actual users provided complementary expertise, which can give a richer     assessment of a design for low literacy Website. These results facilitated design      modification and implementation of solutions by categorizing and prioritizing the      usability problems.

PMID- 20615752   - OBJECTIVE: To reflect about medical informatics as a discipline. To suggest      significant future research directions with the purpose of stimulating further     discussion. METHODS: Exploring and discussing important developments in medical      informatics from the past and in the present by way of examples. Reflecting on      the role of IMIA, the International Medical Informatics Association, in      influencing the discipline. RESULTS: Medical informatics as a discipline is still      young. Today, as a cross-sectional discipline, it forms one of the bases for     medicine and health care. As a consequence considerable responsibility rests on      medical informatics for improving the health of people, through its contributions      to high-quality, efficient health care and to innovative research in biomedicine       and related health and computer sciences. Current major research fields can be      grouped according to the organization, application, and evaluation of health      information systems, to medical knowledge representation, and to the underlying      signal and data analyses and interpretations. Yet, given the fluid nature of many      of the driving forces behind progress in information processing methods and their     technologies, progress in medicine and health care, and the rapidly changing      needs, requirements and expectations of human societies, we can expect many      changes in future medical informatics research. Future research fields might      range from seamless interactivity with automated data capture and storage, via      informatics diagnostics and therapeutics, to living labs with data analysis      methodology, involving sensor-enhanced ambient environments. The role of IMIA,      the International Medical Informatics Association, for building a cooperative,      strongly connected, and research-driven medical informatics community worldwide      can hardly be underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: Health care continuously changes as      the underlying science and practice of health are in continuous transformation.      Medical informatics as a discipline is strongly affected by these changes and is       in a position to be a key, active contributor in these changes.

PMID- 20609619   - BACKGROUND: A locum practitioner is an out-of-hours general practitioner who      needs access to the electronic health record of visiting patients. The electronic      locum record is a summary of the electronic health record available to the locum       practitioner and includes the most significant health problems, the most recent      records of the patient's visits to the practice, current medication data and      information on allergies and intolerances. The locum practitioner returns a locum      medical note to the electronic health record at the general practitioner with his      or her diagnosis, treatment or referral of the visiting patient. A pilot project       of the electronic locum record was implemented in the Twente region of the      Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: To obtain policy information for the nationwide      implementation of the electronic locum record as a first component of the      electronic health record in the Netherlands. METHODS: First, evaluation aspects      were collected from parties involved in the pilot implementation process. Aspects      were taken from the work flow to operationalise the electronic health record.      Secondly, indicator questions were formulated and normative levels agreed for     each indicator by a panel with experts from the medical and information      technology domain. Third, the actual values were rated either by measurement      (technical indicators) or by structured interviews (process indicators) with the       general practitioners who joined the pilot study. Finally, a cross case analysis       was performed by checking for (in-)consistencies among the respondents. RESULTS:       Eight out of the 15 key indicators scored positive, three failed and four     remained inconclusive. The indicators that failed the norms related to the      guideline for electronic registration of patient information, the process of      acquiring the healthcare professional identification card and card-related      services. Indicators that remained inconclusive referred to storing and archiving      of identification cards and codes, the use of the identification repository at      the general practice post and the usefulness and ease-of-use of the electronic      locum record. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that many processes, systems,      services and practices for nation-wide implementation of the electronic locum      record for general practitioners in the Netherlands are in place. However,      significant improvements are required on a number of aspects. For example general      practitioners need to be trained more in applying the guideline for electronic      registration of patient data. Also the process for general practitioners to      acquire their unique healthcare professional identification cards should require       less effort. We also recommend that a strong regional information technology      support group should be in operation during roll-out.

PMID- 20599161   - PURPOSE: Till now no validated instrument exists to measure the readiness and      attitude of diabetic patients towards the use of telemonitoring. The purpose of      the described study was to develop a Telemonitoring Attitude and Readiness      Questionnaire and to check its validity and reliability. METHODS: After     performing in-depth interviews in two separate sessions, the Telemonitoring      Attitude and Readiness Questionnaire was completed by a convenience sample of 138      patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to determine internal consistency.      Test-retest reliability was further evaluated with a subsample of 21 patients.      RESULTS: Analysis supports the validity and reliability of the 13-item      Telemonitoring Health Effect and Readiness Questionnaire (THERQ) with three      subscales: Communication with peers or during holidays with a professional      (Cronbach's alpha=0.84), telemonitoring health effect (Cronbach's alpha=0.87),      and communication with a professional from home (Cronbach's alpha=0.88).      Test-retest reliability is satisfactory (intraclass correlation coefficients      between 0.58 and 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide      preliminary evidence that the Telemonitoring Health Effect and Readiness      Questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the readiness and      subjective feelings of health effect towards the use of telemonitoring. The THERQ      could be used before the implementation of telemonitoring to check if diabetic      patients are interested in the use of it but it could also be used in      (randomized) controlled trials as the questions are put in such a way that also      patients not (yet) using telemonitoring can answer the questions.

PMID- 20576466   - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the issues and challenges involved in      designing and organizing pilot implementations of health information systems      (HIS). Pilot implementations are a widely used approach for identifying design      flaws and implementation issues before full-scale deployment of new HIS. However,      it is not uncommon for pilot implementations to fail in the sense that little can      be learned from them. METHOD: We employed an interpretive case study approach in       attempting to throw light on the reasons why pilot implementations sometimes      fail. We studied the (failed) pilot implementation of an electronic Pregnancy      Record (ePR) in Denmark. Our primary data collection methods comprised      participant observations, semi-structured interviews and document analyses.      RESULTS: Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation process, we      identify three major challenges that complicated the pilot project and eventually      led to its failure, namely difficulties in (1) defining an appropriate scope for       the pilot implementation, (2) coping with unanticipated technical and practical      problems, and (3) ensuring commitment from test users and their managers.      CONCLUSION: Pilot implementations are a very useful technique for developing HIS,      but also one that is very difficult to do successfully. It is sometimes assumed      that pilot implementations are less complicated and risky than regular,      full-scale implementations. However, pilot implementations are not just      small-scale versions of conventional implementations; they are fundamentally      different and they have their own complications and issues to deal with that make      them hard to design and manage.

PMID- 20538514   - PURPOSE: This paper provides a five-year (2002-2007) comparative segmentation      analysis of how the Internet and dedicated health networks are used by European      general practitioners (GPs) and the extent to which external factors affect their     use of various eHealth services. METHODS: Two cross-national sets of survey data       collected in 2002 (n=3512) and 2007 (n=3948) have been analyzed. These databases       provide information on physicians' eHealth uses in EU-15 countries, including      sociodemographic indicators such as country, age, sex, location, and size of the       medical practice. RESULTS: A total of 3512 and 3948 physicians, respectively,      participated in the 2002 and 2007 studies. The percentage of GPs accessing the      Internet or a dedicated health network increased from 64.5% in 2002 to 77.1% in      2007. Only these physicians were included in the latent class cluster analyses      performed on both datasets, yielding three segments of eHealth users plus a group      of non-Internet users. Thus, the following four final segments were identified in      the years 2002 and 2007: 'Information Searchers/Average Users', 'Advanced      Users/Adv. Users (ePrescribers)', 'Laggards', and 'Non-Internet Users'.      Contingency table analyses relating external indicators to physicians' usage      patterns of eHealth services confirmed strong country differences, low to      moderate age influences reflecting a cohort effect, and moderate effects of      practice size, both in 2002 and 2007. Conversely, very weak influences were      observed for physicians' sex and location of the medical practice. CONCLUSION: A       positive evolution is clearly observable in European primary care physicians' use      of eHealth, mainly with regard to online medical information searches, use of      electronic health care records, and (to a lesser extent) electronic transfers of       patient data. The international comparative profiling of European GPs' eHealth      usage patterns contributes to more efficient and continually adapted promotion      strategies, aimed at fostering the diffusion of eHealth applications among      medical professionals of the analyzed EU-15 countries.

PMID- 20537942   - OBJECTIVE: The ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record architecture standard      permits semantically interoperable exchange of Electronic Health Record data by      using archetypes to define the structure and semantics of Electronic Health      Record contents. Practical implementations of the ISO/EN 13606 standard have been      scarcely reported on, and none of the publications describes in detail an      efficient technique of archetype-compliant data extraction from an Electronic      Health Record system. We address this research issue in the present report, and      focus on a specific class of largely research-oriented Electronic Health Record      systems which are internally based on the Entity-Attribute-Value Model. METHOD:      We propose an approach for extracting data described by archetypes from an      Entity-Attribute-Value based Electronic Health Record system in an ISO/EN      13606-conformant manner. The approach is based on mapping from the structure of      exported source documents to the archetype. It is implemented via standard XML      technologies. RESULTS: We tested our approach on an Electronic Health Record      system employed for clinical research at the Medical University of Vienna. Using       test data defined by three different archetypes, source documents were      successfully extracted as archetype-conformant ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health      Record extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic Health Record data may be effectively      extracted from Entity-Attribute-Value based Electronic Health Record systems      using the suggested approach. As a prerequisite for applying our approach, the      internal data model of the Electronic Health Record system and the archetype must      overlap in a way that a semantic mapping between them is possible. The system      must further provide an XML interface which permits the export of the source      documents in conventional format. The export must include data and metadata that       are mandatorily postulated by the archetype and the ISO/EN 13606 Reference Model.

PMID- 20488746   - INTRODUCTION: E-prescribing is part of a new generation of electronic solutions      for the medical industry that may have great potential for improving work flow      and communication between medical practices and pharmacies. In the US, it has      been introduced with minimal monitoring of errors and general usability. This      paper examines refill functionality in e-prescribing software. METHODS: A mixed      method study including focus groups and surveys was conducted. Qualitative data      were collected in on-site focus groups or individual interviews with clinicians      and medical office staff at 64 physician office practices. Focus group      participants described their experiences with the refill functionality of      e-prescribing software, provided suggestions for improving it, and suggested      improvements in office procedures and software functionality. RESULTS: Overall,      approximately 50% reduction in time spent each day on refills was reported.      Overall reports of refill functionality were positive; but clinicians and staff      identified numerous difficulties and glitches associated managing prescription      refills. These glitches diminished over time. Benefits included time saved as      well as patient convenience. Potential for refilling without thought because of      the ease of use was noted. Clinicians and staff appreciated the ability to track       whether patients are filling and refilling prescriptions. DISCUSSION:      E-prescribing software for managing medication refills has not yet reached its      full potential. To reduce work flow barriers and medication errors, software      companies need to develop error reporting systems and response teams to deal      effectively with problems experienced by users. Examining usability issues on      both the medical office and pharmacy ends is required to identify the behavioral       and cultural changes that accompany technological innovation and ease the      transition to full use of e-prescribing software.

PMID- 20478738   - PURPOSE: The impact of the ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) on physician      productivity is poorly understood. Fear of productivity loss remains a major     concern for practitioners and health care delivery organizations and inhibits      system adoption. This study describes the changes in physician productivity after     the implementation of a commercially available ambulatory EHR system in a large      academic multi-specialty physician group. METHODS: Weill Cornell faculty members       implemented on the EpicCare (Epic Systems) EHR between 2001 and 2007 were      identified as potential study participants. Monthly visit volume, charges, and      work relative value units (wRVUs) were compared pre and post each provider's EHR       implementation go-live date. Practitioners who lacked at least 6 months of pre-      and post-implementation visit volume and charge data were excluded. Practitioners      who did not meet pre-determined system proficiency metrics were additionally      identified and became the basis of a non-adopter comparison group. RESULTS: 203      physicians met criteria for the analysis. The eligible providers were divided      into an adopter and non-adopter cohort based on system proficiency benchmarks.      Those practitioners who adopted the EHR had a statistically significant increase       in average monthly patient visit volume of 9 visits per provider per month. The      non-adopter cohort's visit volume was statistically unchanged. Both the EHR     adopters and non-adopters had statistically significant increases (22% and 16%      respectively) in average monthly charges in the post-implementation period.      Average monthly wRVUs were statistically unchanged in the non-adopter cohort, but      showed a positive and statistically significant increase of 12 wRVUs per provider     per month for the adopter group. The EHR adoption group showed an incremental      increase in productivity once practitioners achieved 6 or more months experience       with the EHR, consistent with a "ramp-up" period. A multivariable regression      model did not reveal any association between the post-EHR implementation change      in wRVUs and several potential confounding variables, including baseline provider     average monthly visit volume and wRVUs, date of system adoption, and specialty      categorization. CONCLUSION: Provider productivity, as measured by patient visit      volume, charges, and wRVUs modestly increased for a cohort of multi-specialty      providers that adopted a commercially available ambulatory EHR. The productivity       gain appeared to become even more pronounced after several months of system      experience. This objective data may help persuade apprehensive practitioners that      EHR adoption need not harm productivity. The baseline differences in productivity      metrics for the adopters and non-adopters in our study suggest that there are      fundamental differences in these groups. Further characterizing these differences      may help predict EHR adoption success and guide future implementation strategies.

PMID- 20472495   - PURPOSE: Patients are increasingly interested in using Internet-based      technologies to communicate with their providers, schedule clinic visits, request      medication refills, and view their medical records electronically. However,      healthcare organizations face significant challenges in providing such highly      personal and sensitive communication in an effective and user-friendly manner.      METHODS: Based on the literature and our experience in providing a secure      web-based patient-provider communication portal in primary care clinics, a      framework was developed that identifies key issues and questions to consider in      implementing secure electronic patient-provider communications systems. RESULTS:       The framework serves to categorize the many lessons learned from our     implementation process and the specific issues and questions healthcare      organizations need to consider in implementing such systems related to seven      areas: strategic fit and priority; selection process & implementation team;      integration into communications and workflows; HIPAA issues & clinic policies;      systems implementation & training; marketing & enrollment; on-going performance      monitoring. CONCLUSION: The framework provides a useful guide for organizations      looking to implement secure electronic patient-provider communication systems.

PMID- 20472494   - OBJECTIVES: To identify doctors' utilization of ICT; to develop and characterise       a typology of doctors' utilization of ICT and to identify factors that can      enhance or inhibit the use of these technologies within medical practice.      METHODS: An online survey of the 16,531 members of the Physicians Association of       Barcelona who had a registered email account in 2006 was carried out. Factor     analysis, cluster analysis and binomial logit model were undertaken. RESULTS:      Multivariate statistics analysis of the 2199 responses obtained revealed two      profiles of adoption of ICT. The first profile (38.61% of respondents) represents      those doctors who place high emphasis on ICT within their practice. This group is      thus referred to as 'integrated doctors'. The second profile (61.39% of      respondents) represents those doctors who make less use of ICT so are      consequently labelled 'non-integrated doctors'. From the statistical modelling,      it was observed that an emphasis on international information; emphasis on ICT      for research and medical practice; emphasis on information systems to consult and      prescribe; undertaking teaching/research activities; a belief that the use of the      Internet improved communication with patients and practice in both public and      private health organizations play a positive and significant role in the      probability of being an 'integrated doctor'. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of ICT       within medical practice cannot be adequately understood and appreciated without      examining how doctors are making use of ICT within their own practice,      organizational contexts and the opportunities and constraints afforded by      institutional, professional and patient expectations and demands.

PMID- 20472493   - PURPOSE: This manuscript describes the value of and proposal for a high-level      architectural framework for a Public Health Grid (PHGrid), which the authors feel      has the capability to afford the public health community a robust technology      infrastructure for secure and timely data, information, and knowledge exchange,      not only within the public health domain, but between public health and the      overall health care system. METHODS: The CDC facilitated multiple      Proof-of-Concept (PoC) projects, leveraging an open-source-based software      development methodology, to test four hypotheses with regard to this high-level      framework. The outcomes of the four PoCs in combination with the use of the      Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the newly emerging Federal      Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) was used to develop and refine a      high-level architectural framework for a Public Health Grid infrastructure.      RESULTS: The authors were successful in documenting a robust high-level      architectural framework for a PHGrid. The documentation generated provided a      level of granularity needed to validate the proposal, and included examples of      both information standards and services to be implemented. Both the results of      the PoCs as well as feedback from selected public health partners were used to      develop the granular documentation. CONCLUSIONS: A robust high-level cohesive      architectural framework for a Public Health Grid (PHGrid) has been successfully      articulated, with its feasibility demonstrated via multiple PoCs. In order to      successfully implement this framework for a Public Health Grid, the authors      recommend moving forward with a three-pronged approach focusing on      interoperability and standards, streamlining the PHGrid infrastructure, and      developing robust and high-impact public health services.

PMID- 20452274   - BACKGROUND: Many Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems fail to provide      user-friendly interfaces due to the lack of systematic consideration of      human-centered computing issues. Such interfaces can be improved to provide easy       to use, easy to learn, and error-resistant EHR systems to the users. OBJECTIVE:      To evaluate the usability of an EHR system and suggest areas of improvement in      the user interface. METHODS: The user interface of the AHLTA (Armed Forces Health      Longitudinal Technology Application) was analyzed using the Cognitive Task      Analysis (CTA) method called GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection      rules) and an associated technique called KLM (Keystroke Level Model). The GOMS      method was used to evaluate the AHLTA user interface by classifying each step of       a given task into Mental (Internal) or Physical (External) operators. This      analysis was performed by two analysts independently and the inter-rater     reliability was computed to verify the reliability of the GOMS method. Further     evaluation was performed using KLM to estimate the execution time required to      perform the given task through application of its standard set of operators.      RESULTS: The results are based on the analysis of 14 prototypical tasks performed      by AHLTA users. The results show that on average a user needs to go through 106      steps to complete a task. To perform all 14 tasks, they would spend about 22 min       (independent of system response time) for data entry, of which 11 min are spent      on more effortful mental operators. The inter-rater reliability analysis      performed for all 14 tasks was 0.8 (kappa), indicating good reliability of the      method. CONCLUSION: This paper empirically reveals and identifies the following      finding related to the performance of AHLTA: (1) large number of average total      steps to complete common tasks, (2) high average execution time and (3) large      percentage of mental operators. The user interface can be improved by reducing      (a) the total number of steps and (b) the percentage of mental effort, required      for the tasks.

PMID- 20434946   - PURPOSE: For healthcare terminologies to provide coverage of a domain, many have       evolved into very large and complex sets, creating a challenge for     implementation. The International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP)      Version 2 has over 2800 concepts. Thus, development of terminology subsets is      considered as a potential solution to facilitate implementation. METHOD: Based on      early efforts to develop ICNP Catalogues, or clinically relevant subsets of the      terminology, a process model was developed based on the ICNP life cycle. The      steps involved in developing a subset are (a) identifying client(s) and health      priority, (b) gathering terms and concepts relevant to a given priority, (c)      mapping the identified concepts to the ICNP terminology, (d) modeling new      concepts, (e) finalizing a Catalogue, and (f) disseminating the Catalogue.      RESULTS: The ICNP model was applied to subset development resulting in three ICNP      Catalogues: (a) Partnering with Patients and Families to Promote Adherence to      Treatment, (b) Palliative Care for Dignified Dying, and (c) Canadian Health      Outcomes for Better Information and Care. Although the three Catalogues were very      different in the focus of health priority addressed, there are overlapping      concepts across the Catalogues ranging from 1.0 to 14.2%. CONCLUSION: The ICNP      process model for Catalogue development can be used by other terminology      developers and potentially assist in the creation of subset of ICNP to be used at      the electronic health record interface. Further research is needed to address      challenges and implications for testing and applications of terminology subsets.

PMID- 20418155   - PURPOSE: While search engines have become nearly ubiquitous on the Web,      electronic health records (EHRs) generally lack search functionality;      furthermore, there is no knowledge on how and what healthcare providers search      while using an EHR-based search utility. In this study, we sought to understand      user needs as captured by their search queries. METHODS: This post-implementation      study analyzed user search log files for 6 months from an EHR-based, free-text      search utility at our large academic institution. The search logs were      de-identified and then analyzed in two steps. First, two investigators classified      all the unique queries as navigational, transactional, or informational searches.      Second, three physician reviewers categorized a random sample of 357      informational searches into high-level semantic types derived from the Unified      Medical Language System (UMLS). The reviewers were given overlapping data sets,      such that two physicians reviewed each query. RESULTS: We analyzed 2207 queries      performed by 436 unique users over a 6-month period. Of the 2207 queries, 980      were unique queries. Users of the search utility included clinicians, researchers      and administrative staff. Across the whole user population, approximately 14.5%      of the user searches were navigational searches and 85.1% were informational.      Within informational searches, we found that users predominantly searched for     laboratory results and specific diseases. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of user types,      ranging from clinicians to administrative staff, took advantage of the EHR-based       search utility. Though these users' search behavior differed, they predominantly       performed informational searches related to laboratory results and specific      diseases. Additionally, a number of queries were part of words, implying the need      for a free-text module to be included in any future concept-based search      algorithm.

PMID- 20399139   - OBJECTIVE: For the purpose of establishing electronic health record (EHR),      business-oriented health data distributed in different systems should be      integrated to focus on individuals. This study is aimed at collecting health data      items that are now nationally available in various health information systems,      and harmonizing them by modeling and defining the data elements. METHODS: This      study followed a bottom-up strategy in data standard development. Health data      items were identified and collected by referring to national health service      regulations, consulting domain experts and performing field investigations. Data       items were classified and modeled based on recognized domain knowledge,      information standards and specifications developed by standard development      organizations (SDOs) of other countries. Data elements were extracted from data      items and defined according to ISO/IEC 11179 -Metadata registries (MDR) and      confirmed needs. RESULTS: 1588 data items were collected from 33 recording forms       that have been used nationally in health services, and were classified with a      conceptual data model that was composed of 7 super classes (healthcare clients,      healthcare providers, birth registry, health event/act, healthcare process,      death, and others) and 15 classes (person's identification, person's      socio-demographic characteristics, address, communication, provider-organization,      provider-individual, birth, health event/act, observation, procedure, drug and      material administration, recommendation, evaluation, expenditure, death, others).      By normalizing the concepts and representations of data items, data elements were      derived and defined as the attributes of classes in the data model. Data items      were specified as instances of corresponding data elements. CONCLUSIONS: A large       number of health data have been collected nationwide but person's life-long      health record is incomplete and inconsistent now. To integrate such massive      quantity of health data from various sources, a conceptual data model was      established to organize data items, avoiding conflicts and duplications in      between. For data consistency, data elements should be extracted from the data      items and defined as attributes of classes in the data model by choosing      essential metadata attributes. Treating data items as instances of well defined      data elements might make data in different contexts manageable and agreeable. To       be semantically unambiguous, further study should be performed to deal with the      standardization of detailed medical information, and perfect the approach of data      harmonization.

PMID- 20378396   - CONTEXT: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) can be used to improve the      implementation of clinical practice guidelines by changing the behaviour of care       professionals. While the influence of system characteristics on the effectiveness      of CDSSs is studied, little is known about the relation between cognitive,      organizational and environmental factors, and CDSSs' effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To      assess the effect of CDSSs on cognitive, organizational, and environmental      factors that hamper guideline implementation. DESIGN: In-depth, semi-structured      interviews with care professionals, on reasons for improved adherence or     persistent non-adherence to the prevailing guideline after successful adoption of      a CDSS. All remarks regarding guideline implementation were extracted and      classified using the conceptual framework from Cabana et al. SETTING: Outpatient       cardiac rehabilitation clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Care professionals that used the      CARDSS decision support system for therapeutic decision making in cardiac      rehabilitation. RESULTS: Twenty-nine rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists      from 21 Dutch clinics were interviewed. CARDSS improved guideline adherence by      increasing its users' familiarity with the guidelines' recommendations and      decision logic, by overcoming users' inertia to previous practice, and by      reducing guideline complexity for example by facilitating calculation and      interpretation of data. If the system's recommendations were shared with      patients, refusal to participate in therapies reduced. CARDSS never incited users      to target barriers related to organizational or environmental constraints.      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that computerized decision support can improve      guideline implementation by increasing the knowledge of preferred practice, by      reducing inertia to previous practice, and by reducing guideline complexity.      However, computerized decision support is not effective when organizational or     procedural changes are required that users consider to be beyond their tasks and       responsibilities.

PMID- 20371209   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The experience of clinicians at two public hospitals in      Sydney, Australia, with the introduction and use of an oncology information      system (OIS) was examined to extract lessons to guide the introduction of      clinical information systems in public hospitals. METHODS AND MATERIALS:      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of 15 radiation oncologists      employed at the two hospitals. The personnel involved in the decision making      process for the introduction of the system were contacted and their decision      making process revisited. The transcribed data were analyzed using NVIVO      software. Themes emerged included implementation strategies and practices, the      radiation oncologists' current use and satisfaction with the OIS, project      management and the impact of the OIS on clinical practice. RESULTS: The hospitals      had contrasting experiences in their introduction and use of the OIS. Hospital A       used the OIS in all aspects of clinical documentation. Its implementation was      associated with strong advocacy by the Head of Department, input by a designated       project manager, and use and development of the system by all staff, with timely       training and support. With no vision of developing a paperless information      system, Hospital B used the OIS only for booking and patient tracking. A      departmental policy that data entry for the OIS was centrally undertaken by      administrative staff distanced clinicians from the system. All the clinicians      considered that the OIS should continuously evolve to meet changing clinical      needs and departmental quality improvement initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: This case      study indicates that critical factors for the successful introduction of clinical      information systems into hospital environment were an initial clear vision to be       paperless, strong clinical leadership and management at the departmental level,      committed project management, and involvement of all staff, with appropriate      training. Clinician engagement is essential for post-adoption evolution of      clinical information systems.

PMID- 20347383   - BACKGROUND: Practical sessions in undergraduate medical education are often      costly and have to face constraints in terms of available laboratory time and      practice materials (e.g. blood samples from animals). This makes it difficult to       increase the time each student spends at the laboratory. We consider that it      would be possible to improve the effectiveness of the laboratory time by      providing the students with computer-based simulations for prior rehearsal.      However, this approach still presents issues in terms of development costs and      distribution to the students. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the employment      of low-cost simulation to allow medical students to rehearse practical exercises       through a web-based e-learning environment. The aim is to maximize the efficiency      of laboratory time and resources allocated by letting students become      familiarized with the equipment and the procedures before they attend a      laboratory session, but without requiring large-scale investment. Moreover,      students can access the simulation via the Internet and rehearse at their own      pace. We have studied the effects of such a simulation in terms of impact on the       laboratory session, learning outcomes and student satisfaction. METHODS: We      created a simulation that covers the steps of a practical exercise in a      Physiology course (measuring hematocrit in a blood sample). An experimental group      (EG, n=66) played the simulation 1 week before the laboratory session. A control       group (CG, n=77) attended the laboratory session without playing the simulation.       After the session, all students completed a survey about their perception of the       difficulty of the exercise on a scale of 1-10 and the HCT final value that they      obtained. The students in the EG also completed a survey about their satisfaction      with the experience. RESULTS: After the laboratory session, the perceived      difficulty of the procedure was lower on average in the EG compared to the CG      (3.52 vs. 4.39, 95% CI: 0.16-1.57, P=.016). There was no significant difference      in terms of perceived difficulty using the equipment. The HCT measures reported      by the EG group also presented a much lower dispersion, meaning a higher     reliability, in determining the HCT value (3.10 vs. 26.94, SD; variances      significantly different, P<.001, F: 75.25, Dfd: 68.19 for EG and CG). In the      satisfaction test, the majority of the students in the EG reported that the      experience was positive or very positive (80.7%) and reported that it had helped       them to identify and use the equipment (78%) and to perform the exercise (66%).      CONCLUSIONS: The simulation was well received by students in the EG, who felt      more comfortable during the laboratory session, and it helped them to perform the      exercise better, obtaining more accurate results, which indicates more effective       training. EG students perceived the procedure as easier to perform, but did not      report an improvement in the perceived difficulty in using the equipment. The      increased reliability demonstrates that low-cost simulations are a good      complement to the laboratory sessions.

PMID- 20233670   - OBJECTIVE: Nurses are increasingly using computerised decision support systems      (CDSS) to support their practice. Previous studies have highlighted the      importance organisational factors have on the successful implementation of new      technologies in healthcare. However, it is unclear how the organisations where      nurses work either facilitate or inhibit the successful use of CDSS. The aim of      this paper is to explore what nurses and NHS (National Health Service) managers      working in NHS organisations in England perceive as the organisational features      facilitating the introduction and successful use of CDSS. METHODS: A study of      four case sites where nurses were using CDSS. Data included 124 observations of      nurse/patient consultations, 36 patient interviews, 55 nurse interviews and 18      interviews with clinical unit or NHS managers. The majority of the data were      qualitative and analysed using thematic content analysis. FINDINGS: There were a       number of drivers for the introduction of CDSS, including instigation from      individual clinicians and initiatives at policy level. A key element for the      successful introduction of technology such as CDSS was clinician engagement.      However, also seen as important for successfully implementation of an IT system      are other factors such as the need for adequate resources, characteristics of the      system itself and adequate training. Other key issues are a supportive      environment and the desire to improve continually the quality of patient      services. CONCLUSIONS: For nurses to use CDSS successfully, engagement by      clinicians in the procurement and implementation of systems is useful. However,      the data collected in this study suggest this is not necessary for successful      implementation; nurses may still successfully introduce and use a CDSS if they      perceive it to have benefits to their practice.

PMID- 20219423   - BACKGROUND: "Smart" intravenous infusion pumps (Smart IV pumps) are increasingly       being implemented in hospitals to reduce medication administration errors.      OBJECTIVES: This study examines nurses' experience with the implementation and      use of a Smart IV pump in an academic hospital. METHOD: Data were collected in      three longitudinal surveys: (a) a pre-implementation survey, (b) a      6-week-post-implementation survey, and (c) a 1-year-post-implementation survey.      We examined: (a) the technology implementation process, (b) technical performance      of the pump, (c) usability of the pump, and (d) user acceptance of the pump.      RESULTS: Initially, nurses had a somewhat positive acceptance of the Smart IV      pump technology that significantly increased one year after implementation. User       experiences associated with the pump in general improved over time, especially      perceptions of pump efficiency. However, user experience with the pump      implementation process and pump technical performance did not consistently      improve from the pre-implementation survey to the post-implementation survey.      Several characteristics of pump technical performance and usability influenced      user acceptance at the one-year post-implementation survey. DISCUSSION: These      data may be useful for other institutions to guide implementation and      post-implementation follow-up of IV pump use; other institutions could use the      survey instrument from this study to evaluate nurses' perceptions of the      technology. Our study identified several characteristics of the implementation      process that other institutions may need to pay attention to (e.g., sharing      information about the implementation process with nurses).

PMID- 20207191   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe nurse managers' perceptions of       the use of electronic information systems in their daily work. Several kinds of      software are used for administrative and information management purposes in      health care organizations, but the issue has been studied less from nurse      managers' perspective. METHODS: The material for this qualitative study was      acquired according to the principles of focus group interview. Altogether eight      focus groups were held with 48 nurse managers from both primary and specialized      health care organizations. The nurse managers were asked in focus groups to      describe the use of information systems in their daily work in addition to some      other themes. The material was analyzed by inductive content analysis using      ATLAS.ti computer program. RESULTS: The main category "pros and cons of using      information systems in nursing management" summarized the nurse managers'      perceptions of using electronic information systems. The main category consisted       of three sub-categories: (1) nurse managers' perceptions of the use of      information technology; (2) usability of management information systems; (3)      development of personnel competencies and work processes. CONCLUSIONS: The nurse       managers made several comments on the implementation of immature electronic      information systems which caused inefficiencies in working processes. However,      they considered electronic information systems to be essential elements of their       daily work. Furthermore, the nurse managers' descriptions of the pros and cons of      using information systems reflected partly the shortcomings of strategic      management and lack of coordination in health care organizations.

PMID- 20202895   - PURPOSE: Willingness and ability to learn from health information in text are      crucial for people to be informed and make better medical decisions. These two      user characteristics are influenced by the perceived and actual difficulty of      text. Our goal is to find text features that are indicative of perceived and      actual difficulty so that barriers to reading can be lowered and understanding of      information increased. METHODS: We systematically manipulated three text      characteristics, - overall sentence structure (active, passive,      extraposed-subject, or sentential-subject), noun phrases complexity (simple or     complex), and function word density (high or low), - which are more fine-grained       metrics to evaluate text than the commonly used readability formulas. We measured      perceived difficulty with individual sentences by asking consumers to choose the       easiest and most difficult version of a sentence. We measured actual difficulty      with entire paragraphs by posing multiple-choice questions to measure      understanding and retention of information in easy and difficult versions of the       paragraphs. RESULTS: Based on a study with 86 participants, we found that low      noun phrase complexity and high function words density lead to sentences being      perceived as simpler. In the sentences with passive, sentential-subject, or     extraposed-subject sentences, both main and interaction effects were significant       (all p<.05). In active sentences, only noun phrase complexity mattered (p<.001).       For the same group of participants, simplification of entire paragraphs based on       these three linguistic features had only a small effect on understanding (p=.99)       and no effect on retention of information. CONCLUSIONS: Using grammatical text      features, we could measure and improve the perceived difficulty of text. In      contrast to expectations based on readability formulas, these grammatical      manipulations had limited effects on actual difficulty and so were insufficient      to simplify the text and improve understanding. Future work will include semantic      measures and overall text composition and their effects on perceived and actual      difficulty. LIMITATIONS: These results are limited to grammatical features of      text. The studies also used only one task, a question-answering task, to measure       understanding of information.

PMID- 20189451   - OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) how medical registries provide information feedback      to health care professionals, (2) whether this feedback has any effect on the      quality of care and (3) what the barriers and success factors are to the      effectiveness of feedback. DATA SOURCES: Original articles in English found in      MEDLINE Pubmed covering the period January 1990 to August 2007. REVIEW METHOD:      Titles and abstracts of 6223 original articles were independently screened by two      reviewers to determine relevance for further review. DATA EXTRACTION AND      ANALYSIS: We used a standardized data abstraction form to collect information on       the feedback initiatives and their effectiveness. The effect of the feedback was       only described for analytic papers, i.e. papers that attempted to objectively      quantify the effect on the quality of care and to relate this effect to feedback       as an intervention. For analysis of the effectiveness, we categorized the      initiatives based on the number of elements added to the feedback. RESULTS: We      included 53 papers, describing 50 feedback initiatives, of which 39 were part of       a multifaceted approach. Our results confirm previous research findings that      adding elements to a feedback strategy positively influences its effectiveness.      We found 22 analytic studies, four of which found a positive effect on all      outcome measures, eight found a mix of positive- and no effects and ten did not      find any effects (neither positive nor negative). Of the 43 process of care      measures evaluated in the analytic studies, 26 were positively affected by the      feedback initiative. Of the 36 evaluated outcome of care measures, five were      positively affected. The most frequently mentioned factors influencing the      effectiveness of the feedback were: (trust in) quality of the data, motivation of      the recipients, organizational factors and outcome expectancy of the feedback      recipients. CONCLUSIONS: The literature on methods and effects of information      feedback by medical registries is heterogeneous, making it difficult to draw      definite conclusions on its effectiveness. However, the positive effects cannot      be discarded. Although our review confirms findings from previous studies that      process of care measures are more positively influenced by feedback than outcome       of care measures, further research should attempt to identify outcome of care      measures that are sensitive to behaviour change as a result of feedback      strategies. Furthermore, future studies evaluating the effectiveness of feedback       should include a more extensive description of their intervention in order to      increase the reproducibility of feedback initiatives and the generalizability of       the results.

PMID- 20188623   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this inter-disciplinary literature review was to explore       renewed concerns about the reliability of online health information in light of      the increasing popularity of web applications that enable more end-user-generated      content ("web 2.0"). METHODS: The findings are based on a literature and web      review. Literature was collected at four different points between October 2006      and October 2008 and included 56 sources from 10 academic disciplines. The web      review consisted of following 6 blogs (including both new and archived posts,      with comments) and one wiki for a period of 1.5 months and assessing the content       for relevancy on six points, totaling 63 sources altogether. RESULTS: The      reliability issues that are identified with respect to "web 2.0" reiterate more      general concerns expressed about the web over the last 15 years. The difference,       however, lies in the scope and scale of potential problems. Social scientists      have also pointed to new issues that can be especially relevant for use of web      2.0 applications in health care. Specific points of renewed concern include:      disclosure of authorship and information quality, anonymity and privacy, and the       ability of individuals to apply information to their personal situation. Whether       or not end-users understand what social scientists call "negative network      externalities" is a new concern. Finally, not all reliability issues are      negative-social networking and the shift from text-based information to symbolic       information, images or interactive information, are considered to enhance patient      education and to provide opportunities to reach diverse groups of patients.      CONCLUSIONS: Interactive and collaborative web applications undeniably offer new       opportunities for reaching patients and other health care consumers by      facilitating lay information creation, sharing and retrieval. However,      researchers must be careful and critical when incorporating applications or     practices from other fields in health care. We must not easily dismiss concerns      about reliability as outdated. Specific issues related to use of newly popular     web applications for health purposes must be addressed. Nonetheless, the articles      reviewed here also clearly show that potential problems can be addressed and the       positive aspects of the technologies embraced.

PMID- 20185360   - PURPOSE: Information Technologies and Knowledge-based Systems can significantly      improve the management of complex distributed health systems, where supporting      multidisciplinarity is crucial and communication and synchronization between the       different professionals and tasks becomes essential. This work proposes the use      of the ontological paradigm to describe the organizational knowledge of such      complex healthcare institutions as a basis to support their management. The      ontology engineering process is detailed, as well as the way to maintain the      ontology updated in front of changes. The paper also analyzes how such an      ontology can be exploited in a real healthcare application and the role of the      ontology in the customization of the system. The particular case of senior Home      Care assistance is addressed, as this is a highly distributed field as well as a       strategic goal in an ageing Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed ontology       design is based on a Home Care medical model defined by an European consortium of      Home Care professionals, framed in the scope of the K4Care European project      (FP6). Due to the complexity of the model and the knowledge gap existing between       the - textual - medical model and the strict formalization of an ontology, an      ontology engineering methodology (On-To-Knowledge) has been followed. RESULTS:      After applying the On-To-Knowledge steps, the following results were obtained:      the feasibility study concluded that the ontological paradigm and the      expressiveness of modern ontology languages were enough to describe the required       medical knowledge; after the kick-off and refinement stages, a complete and      non-ambiguous definition of the Home Care model, including its main components      and interrelations, was obtained; the formalization stage expressed HC medical      entities in the form of ontological classes, which are interrelated by means of      hierarchies, properties and semantically rich class restrictions; the evaluation,      carried out by exploiting the ontology into a knowledge-driven e-health      application running on a real scenario, showed that the ontology design and its      exploitation brought several benefits with regards to flexibility, adaptability      and work efficiency from the end-user point of view; for the maintenance stage,      two software tools are presented, aimed to address the incorporation and      modification of healthcare units and the personalization of ontological profiles.      CONCLUSIONS: The paper shows that the ontological paradigm and the expressiveness      of modern ontology languages can be exploited not only to represent terminology      in a non-ambiguous way, but also to formalize the interrelations and      organizational structures involved in a real and distributed healthcare      environment. This kind of ontologies facilitates the adaptation in front of      changes in the healthcare organization or Care Units, supports the creation of      profile-based interaction models in a transparent and seamless way, and increases      the reusability and generality of the developed software components. As a      conclusion of the exploitation of the developed ontology in a real medical      scenario, we can say that an ontology formalizing organizational interrelations      is a key component for building effective distributed knowledge-driven e-health      systems.

PMID- 20181511   - PURPOSE: Examination of electronic patient record (EPR) implementation at the      socio-technical interface. This study was based on the introduction of an      anti-epileptic drug (AED) management module of an EPR in an epilepsy out-patient       clinic. The objective was to introduce the module to a live clinical setting      within strictly controlled conditions to evaluate its usability and usefulness.      METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed in an observational      field study. A purposeful sample of specialists in epilepsy care (2 doctors and 2      nurses) was recruited. Perception of usefulness and ease of use of the AED      module, impact on work processes, and accuracy of use were evaluated using      feedback meetings, evaluation forms, ethnographic analysis and data validation      techniques. Emerging issues were grouped into three key themes: human,      organisational and technological. RESULTS: The electronic patient record use was       studied for 49 patients over the course of 18 out-patient clinics. While      participants varied in their approach to interacting with the AED module, they      expressed satisfaction with its usability and performance. The necessary      co-existence of the paper and electronic record, and changes to customary work      practice were considered the biggest challenges. 82% accuracy in the use of the      electronic record was determined. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving successful electronic      patient record implementation is complex. While technical challenges exist, it is      possibly more important to acknowledge the social considerations. Initially, an      increase in medical record fragmentation and disruption to workflow can arise      with the introduction of the technology. Realising the benefits of electronic      patient records will require the management of a lengthy transition phase.

PMID- 20176502   - PURPOSE: Adverse event reporting systems allow healthcare institutions to detect       and prevent recurrence of avoidable patient harm. It is known that standard      reporting systems, which are initiated by clinicians, detect only a minority of      chart-documented adverse events. The objective of the study was to develop a      web-based system, the Family Reporting System (FRS), to elicit adverse event      reports from families of children admitted to hospital through survey methodology      and human factors engineering techniques. MEASUREMENTS: Face validity and      usability were measured via standardized survey instruments. Utility was measured      via the rate, typology, degree of harm, likelihood of recurrence, quality of      information, and inter-rater agreement analysis of the reported events. RESULTS:       The FRS has good face validity, excellent usability, and good clinical utility.      CONCLUSION: The application of survey and human factors methodologies to the      design of an electronic system is an effective means of developing an electronic       adverse event reporting system for the use of families of pediatric patients.

PMID- 20171929   - PURPOSE: To study correctness of drug safety alert handling and error type in a      computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in a simulated work environment.      METHODS: Disguised observation study of 18 physicians (12 from internal medicine       and 6 from surgery) entering 35 orders of predefined patient cases with 13      different drug safety alerts in a CPOE. Structured interviews about how the      generated drug safety alerts were handled in the simulation test and resemblance       of the test to the normal work environment. Handling and reasons for this were      scored for correctness and error type. RESULTS: Thirty percent of alerts were      handled incorrectly, because the action itself and/or the reason for the handling      were incorrect. Sixty-three percent of the errors were categorized as rule based       and residents in surgery used incorrect justifications twice as often as      residents in internal medicine. They often referred to monitoring of incorrect      substances or parameters. One alert presented as a second alert in one screen was      unconsciously overridden several times. One quarter of residents showed signs of       alert fatigue. CONCLUSION: Although alerts were mainly handled correctly,      underlying rules and reasoning were often incorrect, thereby threatening patient       safety. This study gave an insight into the factors playing a role in incorrect      drug safety alert handling that should be studied in more detail. The results      suggest that better training, improved concise alert texts, and increased      specificity might help. Furthermore, the safety of the predefined override reason      'will monitor' and double alert presentation in one screen is questioned.

PMID- 20153972   - PURPOSE: The emergence and re-emergence of disease outbreaks of international      concern in the last several years has raised the importance of health      surveillance systems that exploit the open media for their timely and precise      detection of events. However, one of the key barriers faced by current      event-based health surveillance systems is in identifying fine-grained terms for       an outbreak's geographical location. In this article, we present a method to      tackle this problem by associating each reported event with the most specific      spatial information available in a news report. This would be useful not only for     health surveillance systems, but also for other event-centered processing      systems. METHODS: To develop an automated spatial attribute annotation system, we      first created a gold standard corpus for training a machine learning model. Since      the qualitative analysis on data suggested that the event class might have an      impact on the spatial attribute annotation, we also developed an event      classification system to incorporate event class information into the spatial      attribute annotation model. To automatically recognize the spatial attribute of      events, several approaches, ranging from a simple heuristic technique to a more      sophisticated approach based on a state-of-the-art Conditional Random Fields      (CRFs) model were explored. Different feature sets were incorporated into the      model and compared. RESULTS: The evaluations were conducted on 100 outbreak news       articles. Spatial attribute recognition performance was evaluated based on three       metrics; precision, recall and the harmonic mean of precision and recall      (F-score). Among three strategies proposed in this article, the CRF model      appeared to be the most promising for spatial attribute recognition with a best      performance of 85.5% F-score (86.3% precision and 84.7% recall). CONCLUSION: We      presented a methodology for associating each event in media outbreak reports with      their spatial attribute at the finest level of granularity. Our goal has been to       provide a means for enhancing the spatial understanding of outbreak-related      events. Evaluation studies showed promising results for automatic spatial      attribute annotation. In the future, we plan to explore more features, such as      semantic correlation between words, that maybe useful for the spatial attribute      annotation task.

PMID- 20153685   - OBJECTIVES: In PubMed search forms, the publication date refers to both the date       of electronic and printed publication. This fact is documented in PubMed, but      difficult to anticipate by the users and can provoke misinterpretations of search      results. The Technical Note aims at systematically investing the effect (referred      to as the publication echo), clarifying onset and extent of the publication echo,      and comments on its impact. METHODS: Papers with ambiguous publication dates are       systematically retrieved and a trend analysis with seasonal decomposition on      monthly publication data is performed. RESULTS: First doubled search results were      found for 1999, their number since then rapidly increasing. Up to 17.6% of all      articles of a year are found to be published electronically and in print, which      can be before or afterwards. Maximum delay between the two dates is three years,       except for one singular publication, where it is five years. Publication trends      are exponential and linear when considering echoed and echo-cleaned data,      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a conclusion, we suggest using a query formulation       that unambiguously retrieves literature from PubMed by the date of publication.

PMID- 20153245   - PURPOSE: The objective of this paper is to show that grounded theory (GT),      together with mixed methods, can be used to involve healthcare professionals in      the design and enhancement of access control policies to Electronic Medical      Record (EMR) systems. METHODS: The mixed methods applied for this research      included, in this sequence, focus groups (main qualitative method that used      grounded theory for the data analysis) and structured questionnaires (secondary      quantitative method). RESULTS: Results showed that the presented methodology can       be used to involve healthcare professionals in the definition of access control      policies to EMR systems and explore these issues in a diversified and integrated       way. The methodology allowed for the generation of great amounts of data in the      beginning of the study and in a short time span. Results from the applied      methodology revealed a first glimpse of the theories to be generated and      integrated, with future research, into access control policies. CONCLUSIONS: The       methodological research described in this paper is very rarely, if ever, applied       in developing security tools such as access control. Nevertheless, it can be an      effective way of involving healthcare professionals in the definition and      enhancement of access control policies and in making information security more      grounded into their workflows and daily practices.

PMID- 20149722   - PURPOSE: To evaluate the functionality of drug safety alerting in hospital      computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems by a newly developed      comprehensive test. METHODS: Comparative evaluation of drug safety alerting      quality in 6 different CPOEs used in Dutch hospitals, by means of 29 test items      for sensitivity and 19 for specificity in offices of CPOE system vendors.      Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the complete test, and for the      categories "within-order checks", "patient-specific checks", and "checks related       to laboratory data and new patient conditions". Qualitative interviews with 16      hospital pharmacists evaluating missing functionality and corresponding pharmacy       checks. RESULTS: Sensitivity ranged from 0.38 to 0.79 and specificity from 0.11      to 0.84. The systems achieved the same ranking for sensitivity as for     specificity. Within-order checks and patient-specific checks were present in all       systems; alert generation or suppression due to laboratory data and new patient      conditions was largely absent. Hospital pharmacists unanimously rated checks on      contra-indications (absent in 2 CPOEs) and dose regimens less than once a day      (absent in 4 CPOEs) as important. Pharmacists' opinions were more divergent for     other test items. A variety of pharmacy checks were used, and clinical rules      developed, to address missing functionality. CONCLUSIONS: Our test revealed      widely varying functionality and appeared to be highly discriminative. Basic      clinical decision support was partly absent in two CPOEs. Hospital pharmacists      did not rate all test items as important and tried to accommodate the lacking      functionality by performing additional checks and developing clinical rules.

PMID- 20138577   - INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate medication among elderly people increases the risk of      adverse drug-drug interactions, drug-related falls and hospital admissions. In      order to prevent these effects it is necessary to obtain a profile of the      patients' medication. A personal digital assistant (PDA) can be used as a medical      decision support system (MDSS) to obtain a profile of the patients' medication      and to check for inappropriate drugs and drug combinations, and to reduce      medication errors. AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate nurses'      experiences of using a MDSS in a PDA with a barcode reader, in order to obtain      profiles of the patients' medication, regarding drug-drug interactions,      therapeutic duplications, and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly in home      care. METHODS: The LIFe-reader is a MDSS in a PDA with a barcode reader. By      scanning the drug packages in the patients' home, the LIFe-reader obtained      profiles of the patients' medication and checked for drug-drug interactions,      therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people.      The LIFe-reader also contained, e.g. drug information and medical reference      works. Nurses (n=15) used the LIFe-reader for five weeks during their nursing      home care practice assignment. The nurses answered questionnaires about the      content and functions of the LIFe-reader before, during and after the nursing      home care practice assignment, and were interviewed in focus groups. Descriptive       statistics were used and content analysis was applied for qualitative data.      RESULTS: By using the LIFe-reader, the majority of the nurses found it easy to      obtain profiles of the patients' medication and check for drug-drug interactions,      therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people.      Most nurses regarded the LIFe-reader to reduce drug-related risks of falling, and      some thought it could reduce the drug-related admissions to hospitals. The      scanning function was described as easy and time saving, although not always      possible to use. The LIFe-reader was regarded as a useful and user-friendly MDSS,      but more content and functions were requested. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the      LIFe-reader has the potential to be a useful and user-friendly MDSS for nurses in      home care when obtaining profiles of the patients' medication regarding drug-drug      interactions, therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for     elderly. A regular scanning of the patients' drugs in their home might support      nurses and general practitioners (GPs) in reducing the inappropriate use of      drugs. If the LIFe-reader should be used in a larger scale among nurses, more      content and functions are necessary.

PMID- 20129820   - PURPOSE: The agent-oriented paradigm has emerged as a viable approach for the      development of autonomic systems in the healthcare domain. This paper reviews      representative works in this area in order to identify the main research lines      and study their level of applicability. Moreover, from the analysis of those      works and the authors' own experiences, some lines of future research are      suggested. METHODS: This paper presents a review of the literature (2002-2008) of      applications of agents in healthcare collected from medical databases as well as       international conferences. RESULTS: 15 agent-based systems were selected      according to a set of criteria of work relevancy. Their internal architecture as       well as communication-based coordination techniques were reviewed. A      classification considering the main goal of the systems has been made. For each      category, a discussion of the suitability of agent technology in resolving      healthcare problems is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Agent-based systems offer added      values over classical software approaches (e.g., reusability, reliability,      flexibility, robustness, maintainability and adaptability). Furthermore, agent      technology supports the integration of legacy systems, tackling the shortcomings       of centralised systems, such as performance bottlenecks, resource limitations,      and different kinds of failures. During the review, we found a huge number of      contributions in this area, showing a growing interest of researchers. However,      most of the analysed systems are only prototypes, they are not widely deployed in      real environments and they are difficult to extend to others domains. Several      aspects (security, reusability, modularity, personalisation, system maintenance)       should be studied carefully in the next years in order to bring agent technology       to real settings.

PMID- 20122867   - OBJECTIVES: Choosing and justifying the right amount of investment in healthcare       information technologies (HITECH or HIT) in hospitals is an ever increasing      challenge. Our objectives are to assess the financial impact of HIT on hospital      outcome, and propose decision-helping tools that could be used to rationalize the      distribution of hospital finances. DESIGN: We used a production function and      microeconomic tools on data of 21 Paris university hospitals recorded from 1998      to 2006 to compute the elasticity coefficients of HIT versus non-HIT capital and       labor as regards to hospital financial outcome and optimize the distribution of      investments according to the productivity associated with each input. RESULTS:      HIT inputs and non-HIT inputs both have a positive and significant impact on      hospital production (elasticity coefficients respectively of 0.106 and 0.893;      R(2) of 0.92). We forecast 2006 results from the 1998 to 2005 dataset with an      accuracy of +0.61%. With the model used, the best proportion of HIT investments      was estimated to be 10.6% of total input and this was predicted to lead to a      total saving of 388 million Euros for the 2006 dataset. CONCLUSION: Considering      HIT investment from the point of view of a global portfolio and applying      econometric and microeconomic tools allow the required confidence level to be      attained for choosing the right amount of HIT investments. It could also allow      hospitals using these tools to make substantial savings, and help them forecast      their choices for the following year for better HITECH governance in the current       stimulation context.

PMID- 20117962   - OBJECTIVES: Maintaining proper access control to Electronic Medical Records (EMR)      is essential to protecting patients' privacy. We aim to develop mechanisms and      tools that can support fine-grained and adaptable access control for EMR. METHOD:      This paper presents an aspect-oriented design and implementation scheme to      providing adaptable access control for Web-based EMR systems. In our scheme,      access control logic is decoupled from the core of the EMR application and      collected into separate aspect modules which are automatically synthesized from      access control rules in XML format and properly designed aspect templates. The      generated aspect modules will then be compiled and integrated into the underlying      EMR application using standard aspect tools. At runtime, these binary aspect      modules will be executed to enforce the required access control. Future changes      of access control rules can also be effectively realized through these mechanisms      without actual coding. RESULTS: A structured form of access control rules based      on the Taiwan Electronic Medical Record Template, a suite of abstract aspects and      templates for enforcing access control and a translator for synthesizing the      complete access control code in AspectJ from such access control rules and aspect      templates. We have also built a Web-based EMR prototype implementation to      demonstrate our approach. CONCLUSION: Our approach can not only accommodate a      wide range of fine-grained access control requirements but also enforce them in a      modular and easy to adapt manner without incurring extra performance overhead due      to rule interpretation. The use of aspect-oriented technology to provide      adaptable access control for EMR is a promising approach. We have further     enhanced our scheme with a mechanism for dynamic adjustment of access control      rules. Other tools for authoring and analyzing the access control rules are the      main parts of our future work.

PMID- 20097600   - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of delivering of computer-generated      discharge summaries to general practice by email, fax, post and patient hand      delivery. DESIGN: Blinded, randomized controlled trial. A pre-study audit      ascertaining baseline statistics and a follow-up survey were conducted with      general practice to determine preferred medium for receiving discharge      communication. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 196 geriatric patients who were admitted      to the aged care ward of a 300-bed metropolitan teaching hospital. Twenty-eight      patients were lost to follow-up and 52 general practices participated in the      final survey. The pre-study audit followed 63 discharges from the same ward.      INTERVENTION: 168 eligible patients were randomly assigned to have their     electronic discharge summary sent by email (n=40), fax (n=48), post (n=40) or     patient hand delivery (n=40). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Receipt of discharge summary      by the general practice clinic within 7 days of patient discharge from hospital.       RESULTS: The receipt rates for email (73.9%, n=17) and fax were comparable      (69.4%, n=25; chi(2)=0.137, df=1, P=0.712), and significantly higher     (chi(2)=19.86, df=3, P<0.0002) than post (43.8%, n=14) and patient hand delivery       (24.2%, n=8). General practices indicated that fax was the most preferred method       (82.7%) for communication of discharge summaries. The majority of general      practices (75.0%) utilized an electronic system for storage of patient      information while 88.5% of practices reported using medical prescribing software.      CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of computer-generated discharge summaries by fax or     email offers the most effective method of communicating with primary care      physicians, as long as accurate contact information is available. Although fax is      still the most preferred, email has many advantages that could potentially allow       it to replace fax as a standard mode for delivery of discharge communication.

PMID- 20089444   - PURPOSE: We implemented computer-based reminders for CD4 count tests at an HIV      clinic in Western Kenya though an open-source Electronic Medical Record System.      Within a month, providers had stopped complying with the reminders. METHODS: We      used a multi-method qualitative approach to determine reasons for failure to      adhere to the reminders, and took multiple corrective actions to remedy the      situation. RESULTS: Major reasons for failure of the reminder system included:      not considering delayed data entry and pending test results; relying on wrong      data inadvertently entered into the system; inadequate training of providers who       would sometimes disagree with the reminder suggestions; and resource issues      making generation of reminders unreliable. With appropriate corrective actions,      the reminder system has now been functional for over eight months. CONCLUSION:      Implementing clinical decision support in resource-limited settings is      challenging. Understanding and correcting root causes of problems related to      reminders will facilitate successful implementation of the decision support      systems in these settings.

PMID- 20083427   - OBJECTIVE: Patient falls constitute a serious problem both for the persons fallen      and for the institutions involved. Bed-exit alarm systems are used to reduce      patient falls. Existing bed-exit alarm systems have several disadvantages      depending on the technology used. As in "Evaluation of Bed-Exit Alarms" stated,      restless, light weighted, uncooperative, incontinent and confused patients      require different systems. The aim of this work is to present the research and      development process of the integrated, universally applicable BUCINATOR     bed-exit-alarm system. METHODS: The use-case technique was applied to capture the      functional requirements for the development of the new integrated bed-exit alarm       system. An experimental study was carried out to collect data regarding      preliminary sensitivity and specificity for alarm set-off. RESULTS: Major     identified requirements for an optimized bed-exit alarm system were usability,      wide range usage, low costs, hygiene factors, integration into nursing beds and      nurse call systems and an adequate alarm/false alarm ratio with early alarm      trigger functionality. On the basis of the criteria mentioned above, a sensor     system was developed, comprising tubes with an air-filled passageway attached on       the top of side rails. These tubes are coupled via lines to transducers which      trigger an alarm when a predetermined level of pressure is reached. Both the      preliminary sensitivity (96.0%) and the specificity (>or=95.5%) of the trigger     level indicate a satisfactory alarm/false alarm ratio which is now to be      evaluated in a clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: After experimental testing, BUCINATOR     shows great potential to be a reliable bed-exit alarm system. In general,      bed-exit alarm systems with extended features could play a major role in ambient       assisted living technologies. LIMITATIONS: Besides the theoretical evaluation, it      will be imperative to perform more tests and to gather more data about the effect      on fall rates and resulting injuries.

PMID- 20079686   - OBJECTIVE: Health information technology has been shown to influence the      communication patterns of healthcare providers. The goal of this study was to      learn more about how healthcare providers communicate and exchange patient      clinical information during patient handoffs (transfers) between units in an      acute care setting. METHODS: Convenience sampling was used to select five patient      handoffs. Questionnaires were distributed to providers identified through      observation and snowball sampling. Social network analysis methodology was used      to develop sociograms of the emergent communication patterns and identify the      role of individual providers in the handoff process based on the number of      contacts with other providers and incoming and outgoing communication activity.      Individual handoff network size ranged from 11 to 20 providers. Participants were      asked to describe the method of communication they used to access or share      clinical information with other providers, their preferred method of      communication; their satisfaction with the available options; and their     suggestions for how the process could be improved. RESULTS: The network patterns       that emerged uncovered the overlapping use of synchronous and asynchronous      communication methods (verbally via phone or in person; or written via paper     charts and/or an electronic records). No particular professional group dominated       or coordinated information flow; instead each handoff network exhibited unique      communication patterns and information coordination by two or more influential      providers from nursing, medicine, or pharmacy. Most (84%) participants preferred       verbal communication. Overall satisfaction with the current communication process      varied by unit: 82% of emergency department providers and 54% of the providers      working in the admitting units stated they were satisfied or very satisfied.      Recommendations for improvement included converting all units to the electronic      health record, electronic handoff communication modules and asynchronous      multi-professional communication logs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this      exploratory study provide a foundation for future research examining how network       structure and communication principles can be used to design health information      technology that compliments the non-linear information gathering and      dissemination behaviors of providers from multiple professions.

PMID- 20079685   - OBJECTIVE: National electronic health record programs are frequently associated      with a number of problems. In view of their long duration and costs, efficient      implementation of the programs with due regard given to the conclusions drawn      thus far would be a meaningful goal from the economic point of view. In the      present report we analyze programs from various countries with regard to the      problems documented therein and derive, on a cross-country basis, the most common      critical aspects of national electronic health record programs. These aspects      should be given special attention in the implementation of future national      electronic health record programs. Furthermore, measures which have proven to be       useful in coping with the respective problems in individual countries will be      suggested for each critical area. METHOD: Five countries were selected in which      (a) programs for a national electronic health record system exist since at least       5 years, (b) the planned electronic health record systems encompass various      approaches of implementation, and (c) pilot projects have already been conducted.      The programs of these countries were analyzed on the basis of project reviews and      audits with reference to the problems documented during their implementation.      These were abstracted and standardized into cross-country categories which, in      turn, were grouped into critical areas. RESULTS: From the analysis of national      electronic health record programs from England, Germany, Canada, Denmark and      Australia, the following frequently involved critical areas were derived: (a)      acceptance and change management, (b) demonstration of benefits and funding, (c)       project management, (d) Health-policy-related goals and implementation strategy,       (e) basic legal requirements, particularly in the field of data protection.      CONCLUSIONS: The analysis shows that similar critical areas exist in the various       countries. Strategic, organizational and human challenges are usually more      difficult to master than technical aspects. The measures used thus far to deal      with the critical areas are selective approaches towards resolving individual      problems. For the future it would be desirable to set up a comprehensive method      that provides support in the complete process of implementing national electronic      health record programs and hereby covers all critical areas identified within      this paper.

PMID- 20071219   - PURPOSE: To identify and describe physicians' beliefs about use of electronic      medical records (EMR) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for inpatient       and outpatient care, to build an understanding of what factors shape information       technology (IT) use behavior in the unique context of health care delivery.      METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative research interviews were carried out,      following the beliefs elicitation approach. Twenty physicians from two large      Midwest US hospitals participated. Physicians were asked questions to elicit      beliefs and experiences pertaining to their use of EMR and CPOE. Questions were      based on a broad set of behavior-shaping beliefs and the methods commonly used to      elicit those beliefs. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed numerous themes      related to the perceived emotional and instrumental outcomes of EMR and CPOE use;      perceived external and personal normative pressure to use those systems;      perceived volitional control over use behavior; perceived facilitators and      barriers to system use; and perceptions about the systems and how they were      implemented. EMR and CPOE were commonly believed to both improve and worsen the      ease and quality of personal performance, productivity and efficiency, and      patient outcomes. Physicians felt encouraged by employers and others to use the      systems but also had personal role-related and moral concerns about doing so.      Perceived facilitators and barriers were numerous and had their sources in all      aspects of the work system. CONCLUSION: Given the breadth and detail of elicited       beliefs, numerous design and policy implications can be identified. Additionally,      the findings are a first step toward developing a theory of health IT acceptance       and use contextualized to the unique setting of health care.

PMID- 20061182   - PURPOSE: For small-to-medium sized primary care practices (those with 20 or fewer     clinicians), determine desired functions of health information exchange (HIE) and      potential motivators, barriers, and facilitators of adoption. METHODS: Case study      approach with mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Nine practices in      Colorado were purposively selected. Five used paper records and four were already      participating in health information exchange. RESULTS: Practices particularly      desired HIE functions to allow anywhere/anytime lookup of test results and to      consolidate delivery of test results. HIE-generated quality reporting was the      least desired function. Practices were motivated to adopt HIE to improve the      quality and efficiency of care, although they did not anticipate financial gains       from adoption. The greatest facilitator of HIE adoption would be technical      assistance and support during and after implementation. Financial incentives were      also valued. Trust in HIE partners was a major issue, and practices with rich      professional and social networks appeared to be especially favorable settings for     HIE adoption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may assist policymakers in promoting      adoption of HIE among small-to-medium sized primary care practices, a major     component of the US healthcare system.

PMID- 20053582   - PURPOSE: To determine the features of commercially available USB-based Personal      Health Records (PHR) devices, and compare the commercial state of the art to      recommendations made by certification committees. METHODS: Thirteen USB-based      PHRs were identified and analyzed based on data elements used and features      provided. Marketing techniques used by the companies were also explored. RESULTS:      Eight of the thirteen PHRs contained all seven clinical data elements (problems,       procedures, medications, providers, allergies, labs, immunizations), three were      missing a single element and the remaining two lacked two elements. In the      features analysis no single PHR contained all eight features (export data, import      data, images, summary print out, emergency entry, teaching material available for     problem, username and password supported, Mac-compatible), but two of the devices      had seven of the eight features. Finally, scare tactics were used in marketing      all but two of the PHR devices. CONCLUSION: While PHRs are very important in the       health care field, at the present time, USB-based PHRs currently on the market      appear to have deficiencies. Tethered or web-based PHRs may be a better option      for consumers at present.

PMID- 20036193   - PURPOSE: Getting the right information to providers can improve quality of care.       We set out to provide patient-specific Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-based      clinical summaries for providers taking care of HIV-positive adult patients in      the resource-limited setting of Mbarara, Uganda. METHODS: We evaluated the impact      of implementing these clinical summaries using time-motion techniques and      provider surveys. RESULTS: After implementation of EMR-based clinical summaries,       providers spent more time in direct care of patients (2.9 min vs. 2.3 min,      p<0.001), and the length of patient visits was reduced by 11.5 min. Survey      respondents indicated that clinical summaries improved care, reduced mistakes,      and were generally accurate. Current antiretroviral medication, patient      identifying information, adherence information, current medication, and current      medical problems were among the highest-rated elements of the summary.      CONCLUSIONS: By taking advantage of data stored in EMRs, efficiency and quality      of care can be improved through clinical summaries, even in settings with limited      resources.

PMID- 20031482   - BACKGROUND: Acceptance by citizens seems to be crucial for the future success of       an electronic health record (EHR) in Germany and Austria. We analyzed citizens'      knowledge and expectations about the concept and contents of an EHR. We also      addressed possible fears and barriers, and we investigated desired EHR     functionalities relevant to citizens in the Austrian and German population.      METHODS: Standardized interviews of a convenience sample of 203 Austrian and 293       German citizens recruited in two metropolises. RESULTS: Up to three-quarter of      the interviewed citizens already collect and store medical documents at home,      mostly in paper-based form. No respondents had already used an Internet-based      personal health record. Between 80% and 90% of respondents were supportive of the      idea of an electronic exchange of health-related data between health care      providers as core functionality of an EHR. However, many respondents formulated      concerns with regard to data protection and data security within an EHR. The EHR       functionalities most supported by respondents included the electronic vaccination      record, online information on doctors and hospitals, and the administration of      appointments and reminders. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a generally positive      attitude towards the EHR. However, the study shows that data protection is an      issue for many citizens, and that despite strong media discussion, there are      information deficits with regard to the national EHR initiatives.

PMID- 20005771   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify challenges to      inter-departmental coordination activities that affect patient transfer workflow       and to provide socio-technical requirements for the design of technologies to      better support patient transfer workflow. DESIGN: We conducted our study in two      clinical and one non-clinical department at a major academic hospital. We      utilized qualitative data collection techniques including observations of patient      transfer practices of the different departments and interviews with departmental       staff to collect data on the inter-departmental coordination activities and its      effect on patient transfer workflow. RESULTS: We identified three      inter-departmental challenges that affected the patient transfer workflow:      ineffective inter-departmental interactions, ineffective information handoffs,      and ineffectiveness of current information technologies. DISCUSSION: To address      these challenges, we discuss three socio-technical design requirements that      designers need to pay attention to while developing inter-departmental healthcare      information systems. To ensure effective inter-departmental coordination, the      systems should incorporate features that can support the mediating role of      integrators, the collaborative balancing of goals, and the collaborative      prioritization of resources.

PMID- 19969503   - OBJECTIVE: With the aim of making good use of internationally accumulated genomic      sequence variation data, which is increasing rapidly due to the explosive amount       of genomic research at present, the development of an interoperable data exchange      format and its international standardization are necessary. Genomic Sequence      Variation Markup Language (GSVML) will focus on genomic sequence variation data      and human health applications, such as gene based medicine or pharmacogenomics.      DESIGN AND METHOD: We developed GSVML through eight steps, based on case analysis      and domain investigations. By focusing on the design scope to human health      applications and genomic sequence variation, we attempted to eliminate ambiguity       and to ensure practicability. We intended to satisfy the requirements derived      from the use case analysis of human-based clinical genomic applications. Based on      database investigations, we attempted to minimize the redundancy of the data      format, while maximizing the data covering range. We also attempted to ensure      communication and interface ability with other Markup Languages, for exchange of       omics data among various omics researchers or facilities. The interface ability      with developing clinical standards, such as the Health Level Seven Genotype      Information model, was analyzed. RESULTS: We developed the human health-oriented       GSVML comprising variation data, direct annotation, and indirect annotation      categories; the variation data category is required, while the direct and      indirect annotation categories are optional. The annotation categories contain      omics and clinical information, and have internal relationships. For designing,      we examined 6 cases for three criteria as human health application and 15 data      elements for three criteria as data formats for genomic sequence variation data      exchange. The data format of five international SNP databases and six Markup      Languages and the interface ability to the Health Level Seven Genotype Model in      terms of 317 items were investigated. CONCLUSION: GSVML was developed as a      potential data exchanging format for genomic sequence variation data exchange      focusing on human health applications. The international standardization of GSVML      is necessary, and is currently underway. GSVML can be applied to enhance the      utilization of genomic sequence variation data worldwide by providing a      communicable platform between clinical and research applications.

PMID- 19945338   - PURPOSE: To describe social support for weight loss shared by members of a large       Internet weight loss community. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study with       surveys (n=193) and interviews (n=13) of community members along with a content      analysis of discussion forum messages (n=1924 messages). Qualitative data were      analyzed for social support themes. RESULTS: Survey respondents were primarily      white (91.4%) and female (93.8%) with mean age 37.3 years and mean body mass      index 30.9. They used forums frequently, with 56.8% reading messages, 36.1%      replying to messages, and 18.5% posting messages to start a discussion related to      weight loss on a daily or more frequent basis. Major social support themes were      encouragement and motivation, mentioned at least once by 87.6% of survey      respondents, followed by information (58.5%) and shared experiences (42.5%).      Subthemes included testimonies, recognition for success, accountability, friendly      competition, and humor. Members valued convenience, anonymity, and the      non-judgmental interactions as unique characteristics of Internet-mediated      support. CONCLUSION: This Internet weight loss community plays a prominent role      in participants' weight loss efforts. Social support within Internet weight loss       communities merits further evaluation as a weight loss resource for clinicians to      recommend to patients. Understanding these communities could improve how health      professionals evaluate, build, harness, and manipulate social support for weight       loss.

PMID- 19939731   - PURPOSE: Our purpose is to counter the common wisdom that doctors are refractory       to change and therefore responsible for the limited use of electronic medical      records. METHODS: We draw on experience with electronic medical records in two      Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals dating back to the early 1980s.      RESULTS: Doctors quickly become ardent users of electronic medical records if the      software is sufficiently helpful in the care of their patients. CONCLUSIONS: The       key to enthusiastic acceptance of electronic medical records is computing that is      easy to use and helpful to doctors, nurses, and other clinicians in the care of      their patients.

PMID- 19896893   - BACKGROUND: Breakdowns in communication and coordination are situations of      mismatch between actual and expected conditions in joint activities. Breakdowns      have been identified as the leading cause of adverse events in healthcare,      especially in the Operating Room environment. As a result, researchers have      started to examine breakdowns in healthcare as emergent dynamics of teamwork.      However, the occurrence and consequences of breakdowns related to inter-team      processes are yet to be addressed at a fine level of detail. In this paper we      seek understanding of breakdowns at the systemic level, and its relevance to      design. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to bring forward an in-depth      understanding of the impact of breakdowns on the surgical process by expanding      the focus of analysis beyond teamwork dynamics, to the level of hospital system      processes. This study also aims to examine the implications of such understanding      of breakdowns for the design of clinical systems. METHODS: Properties of      breakdowns and repairs were inductively derived, and developed into a formal      coding scheme, which was applied over a set of observed breakdowns from an      elective surgery unit in a North American hospital. Systematic content analysis      was employed to quantify qualitative data spanning 79 h of observations, followed      by statistical hypotheses testing for relationships between variables of      breakdowns and repairs. MEASURES: Breakdown type, theme, tangibility,      coordination scale, breakdown lifetime, repair strategy, and repair cost.      RESULTS: The results reveal that properties of breakdowns determine properties of      repairs. The majority of breakdowns were outside the scope of teamwork--at the      inter-team coordination level. The results also demonstrate that breakdowns      usually propagate downstream in the surgical process, affecting the work of      multiple teams, and the longer they propagate the higher the communication cost      associated with the respective repair. The implications are two-fold: in terms of      theory we develop a conceptual framework of breakdowns in perioperative work, and      in terms of system design we propose a design framework informed by the acquired       understanding of breakdowns. CONCLUSIONS: This study achieved an initial      understanding of the deep features of breakdowns from a process-oriented      perspective, which allowed us to build the groundwork for a theoretical model of       breakdowns in perioperative activities and to propose a design approach that      tackles breakdowns during early stages of system development. The direct      association between breakdowns and repairs can be exploited in both IT-system      design and organizational design. The patterns of repair work can inform design      so as to provide clinicians with the types of information that will prevent      breakdowns from occurring or to mitigate the impact of breakdowns. The results      reveal that preventing breakdown propagation should be a prime target in surgical      applications design.

PMID- 19853501   - OBJECTIVE: This paper intends to apply association rule mining (ARM) to explore      the labyrinthian network of ADHD comorbidity, and to examine the practicality of       ARM in comorbidity studies using clinic databases. METHODS: From clinic records      of enrollees of Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI), 18,321 youngsters aged 18      or less with diagnosis of ADHD in 2001 were recruited as case group in this      study. And all their clinic diagnoses made from 2000 to 2002, as comorbidity,      were categorized according to "The International Classification of Disease, 9th      Revision, Clinical Modification" (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis system. For comparison,      fourfold non-ADHD controls were recruited from 2001s NHI enrollees on a random      base but matched gender and age of cases. ARM was done with Apriori algorithm to       examine the strengths of associations among those diagnoses. The support and      confidence values of ARM results were examined. Comorbidity rates and relative      risk (RR) ratios of both groups of each diagnosis were compared one another.      RESULTS: ADHD case group has apparently higher risk of comorbidity with      psychiatric comorbidity than with other physical illnesses. From results of ARM,       developmental delay (DD) appears as an important node between ADHD and anxiety      disorder (support: 5.12%, confidence: 97.42%), mild mental retardation (support:       4.42%, confidence: 92.09%) and autism (support: 6.49%, confidence: 94.93%).      CONCLUSIONS: The finding of this study, an important role of DD between ADHD and       other psychiatric comorbidity, supports neurological findings in developmental      delay of ADHD children's front cortex, as well as some epidemiology findings.      This study also demonstrated the practicality of ARM in comorbidity studies using      enormous clinic databases like NHIRD.

PMID- 19828365   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate GPs use of three major electronic patient record systems      with emphasis on the ability of the systems to support important clinical tasks      and to compare the findings with results from a study of the three major     hospital-wide systems. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional questionnaire survey       was conducted in Norwegian primary care. 247 (73%) of 338 GPs responded.      Proportions of the respondents who reported to use the EPR system to conduct 23      central clinical tasks, differences in the proportions of users of different EPR       systems and user satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the EPR system were      measured. RESULTS: The GPs reported extensive use of their EPR systems to support      clinical tasks. There were no significant differences in functionality between      the systems, but there were differences in reported software and hardware      dysfunction and user satisfaction. The respondents reported high scores in      computer literacy and there was no correlation between computer usage and      respondent age or gender. A comparison with hospital physicians' use of three      hospital-wide EPR systems revealed that GPs had higher usage than the      hospital-based MDs. Primary care EPR systems support clinical tasks far better     than hospital systems with better overall user satisfaction and reported impact      on the overall quality of the work. CONCLUSION: EPR systems in Norwegian primary       care that have been developed in accordance with the principles of user-centered       design have achieved widespread adoption and highly integrated use. The quality      and efficiency of the clinical work has increased in contrast to the situation of      their hospital colleagues, who report more modest use and benefits of EPR     systems.

PMID- 19828364   - PURPOSE: To explore the need for, and use of, high-quality, collaborative,      clinical knowledge management (CKM) tools and techniques to manage clinical      decision support (CDS) content. METHODS: In order to better understand the      current state of the art in CKM, we developed a survey of potential CKM tools and      techniques. We conducted an exploratory study by querying a convenience sample of      respondents about their use of specific practices in CKM. RESULTS: The following       tools and techniques should be priorities in organizations interested in      developing successful computer-based provider order entry (CPOE) and CDS      implementations: (1) a multidisciplinary team responsible for creating and      maintaining the clinical content; (2) an external organizational repository of      clinical content with web-based viewer that allows anyone in the organization to       review it; (3) an online, collaborative, interactive, Internet-based tool to      facilitate content development; (4) an enterprise-wide tool to maintain the      controlled clinical terminology concepts. Even organizations that have been      successfully using computer-based provider order entry with advanced clinical      decision support features for well over 15 years are not using all of the CKM      tools or practices that we identified. CONCLUSIONS: If we are to further     stimulate progress in the area of clinical decision support, we must continue to       develop and refine our understanding and use of advanced CKM capabilities.

PMID- 19815452   - INTRODUCTION: Evaluations of computerized clinical decision support systems      (CDSS) typically focus on clinical performance changes and do not include social,      organizational, and contextual characteristics explaining use and effectiveness.       Studies of CDSS for intensive insulin therapy (IIT) are no exception, and the      literature lacks an understanding of effective computer-based IIT implementation       and operation. RESULTS: This paper presents (1) a literature review of      computer-based IIT evaluations through the lens of institutional theory, a      discipline from sociology and organization studies, to demonstrate the      inconsistent reporting of workflow and care process execution and (2) a      single-site case study to illustrate how computer-based IIT requires substantial       organizational change and creates additional complexity with unintended      consequences including error. DISCUSSION: Computer-based IIT requires      organizational commitment and attention to site-specific technology, workflow,      and care processes to achieve intensive insulin therapy goals. The complex      interaction between clinicians, blood glucose testing devices, and CDSS may      contribute to workflow inefficiency and error. Evaluations rarely focus on the      perspective of nurses, the primary users of computer-based IIT whose knowledge      can potentially lead to process and care improvements. CONCLUSION: This paper     addresses a gap in the literature concerning the social, organizational, and      contextual characteristics of CDSS in general and for intensive insulin therapy      specifically. Additionally, this paper identifies areas for future research to      define optimal computer-based IIT process execution: the frequency and effect of       manual data entry error of blood glucose values, the frequency and effect of      nurse overrides of CDSS insulin dosing recommendations, and comprehensive      ethnographic study of CDSS for IIT.

PMID- 19800840   - BACKGROUND: Medication errors in hospital discharge summaries have the potential       to cause serious harm to patients. These errors are generally associated with      manual transcription of medications between medication charts and discharge      summaries. Studies also show junior doctors are more likely to contribute to      discharge medication error rates. Electronic discharge summaries have the      potential to reduce discharge medication errors to ensure the safe handover of      care to the primary care provider. OBJECTIVES: (1) Quantify and compare the      medication transcription error rate from handwritten medications on manual      discharge summaries to typed medications on electronic discharge summaries, and      (2) examine the quality of medication documentation according to the level of      medical training of the doctors who created the discharge summaries. METHODS: A      retrospective examination of 966 handwritten and 842 electronically generated      discharge summaries was conducted in an Australian metropolitan hospital. The      electronic discharge summaries at the study site were not integrated with an      electronic medication management system and hence discharge medications were      typed into the electronic discharge summary by the doctor. The discharge      medication documentation in both types of summaries was transcribed, either     handwritten or typed, from inpatient medication charts in paper-based medical      records. Documentation differences between medications in discharge summaries and      inpatient medication charts constituted medication errors. RESULTS: 12.1% of      handwritten and 13.3% of electronic summaries contained medication errors. The      highest number of errors occurred with cardiovascular drugs. Medication omission       was the commonest error. The confidence intervals of all odds ratios indicate      handwritten and electronic summaries were similar for all areas of medication      error. Error rates regarding all 13,566 individual medications for the 1808      summaries were similar by doctor medical training level (intern, resident, and      registrar). CONCLUSION: Similar medication error rates in handwritten and      electronic summaries may be due to the common factor of transcription, either     handwritten or typed, known to be associated with medication errors. Clinical      information systems evolve and often in the early stages of implementation      electronic discharge summaries are integrated with existing paper-based patient      record systems. Automatic transfer of medications from an electronic medication      management system to the electronic discharge summary holds the potential to      reduce medication errors through the elimination of the transcription process.

PMID- 19783204   - OBJECTIVE: Nonattendance for appointments remains a challenge to health care      managers and providers. The objective of this article is to present the results      of a study on the impact of appointment reminders sent as short message service      text messages to patients' cell phones on nonattendance rates at outpatient      clinics in Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Data were collected on scheduled      appointments in four medical clinics using Clinic Manager or Clinic Web systems      that can send automated messages to patients. Data on appointment attendance were      collected from these systems. MEASUREMENTS: More than 29,000 appointments were      scheduled between July 1, 2007, and May 31, 2008, and for 7890 of them a text      message reminder was sent to the patient's cell phone. The rates of nonattendance      were compared between those who were sent and those who were not sent a text      message as an appointment reminder. RESULTS: The nonattendance reduction rates      for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p= .590),      3.55% (p= .009), 5.75% (p= .022), and 14.49% (p= < .001). CONCLUSION: The study      results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients'      cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients      attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving      uninterrupted care benefit.

PMID- 19783203   - PURPOSE: This manuscript describes the health information system security threat       lifecycle (HISSTL) theory. The theory is grounded in case study data analyzing      clinicians' health information system (HIS) privacy and security (P&S)      experiences in the practice context. METHODS: The 'questerview' technique was      applied to this study of 26 clinicians situated in 3 large Australian (across      Victoria) teaching hospitals. Questerviews rely on data collection that apply      standardized questions and questionnaires during recorded interviews. Analysis      (using Nvivo) involved the iterative scrutiny of interview transcripts to      identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Issues including poor training, ambiguous      legal frameworks containing punitive threats, productivity challenges, usability       errors and the limitations of the natural hospital environment emerged from      empirical data about the clinicians' HIS P&S practices. The natural hospital      environment is defined by the permanence of electronic HISs (e-HISs), shared      workspaces, outdated HIT infrastructure, constant interruption, a P&S regulatory       environment that is not conducive to optimal training outcomes and budgetary      constraints. The evidence also indicated the obtrusiveness, timeliness, and      reliability of P&S implementations for clinical work affected participant      attitudes to, and use of, e-HISs. CONCLUSION: The HISSTL emerged from the      analysis of study evidence. The theory embodies elements such as the fiscal,      regulatory and natural hospital environments which impede P&S implementations in       practice settings. These elements conflict with improved patient care outcomes.      Efforts by clinicians to avoid conflict and emphasize patient care above P&S      tended to manifest as security breaches. These breaches entrench factors beyond      clinician control and perpetuate those within clinician control. Security      breaches of health information can progress through the HISSTL. Some preliminary       suggestions for addressing these issues are proposed. STUDY LIMITATIONS:      Legislative frameworks that are not related to direct patient care were excluded       from this study. Other limitations included an exclusive focus on patient care      tasks post-admission and pre-discharge from public hospital wards. Finally, the      number of cases was limited by the number of participants who volunteered to      participate in the study. It is reasonable to assume these participants were more      interested in the P&S of patient care work than their counterparts, though the      study was not intended to provide quantitative or statistical data. Nonetheless,       additional case studies would strengthen the HISSTL theory if confirmatory,      practice-based evidence were found.

PMID- 19775933   - BACKGROUND: The evolution of information technologies and telecommunications has       made the World Wide Web a low cost and easily accessible tool for the      dissemination of information and knowledge. Continuous Medical Education (CME)      sites dedicated in cytopathology field are rather poor, they do not succeed in      following the constant changes and lack the ability of providing cytopathologists      with a dynamic learning environment, adaptable to the development of      cytopathology. Learning methods including skills such as decision making,      reasoning and problem solving are critical in the development of such a learning       environment. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are (1) to demonstrate on      the basis of a web-based training system the successful application of      traditional learning theories and methods and (2) to effectively evaluate users'       perception towards the educational program, using a combination of observers,      theories and methods. IMPLEMENTATION: Trainees are given the opportunity to      browse through the educational material, collaborate in synchronous and      asynchronous mode, practice their skills through problems and tasks and test      their knowledge using the self-evaluation tool. On the other hand, the trainers      are responsible for editing learning material, attending students' progress and      organizing the problem-based and task-based scenarios. The implementation of the       web-based training system is based on the three-tier architecture and uses an      Apache Tomcat web server and a MySQL database server. METHODS: By December 2008,       CytoTrainer's learning environment contains two courses in cytopathology:      Gynaecological Cytology and Thyroid Cytology offering about 2000 digital images      and 20 case sessions. Our evaluation method is a combination of both qualitative       and quantitative approaches to explore how the various parts of the system and      students' attitudes work together. RESULTS: Trainees approved of the course's      content, methodology and learning activities. The triangulation of evaluation      methods revealed that the training program is suitable for the continuous      distance education in cytopathology and that it has improved the trainees' skills      in diagnostic cytopathology. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based training system can be      successfully involved in the continuous distance education in cytopathology. It      provides the opportunity to access learning material from any place at any time      and supports the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge.

PMID- 19767235   - OBJECTIVE: To explore nurses' perceptions of the impact on clinical practice of      the use of a computerised hospital information system. DESIGN: A realistic      evaluation design based on Pawson and Tilley's work has been used across all the       phases of the study. This is a theory-driven approach and focuses evaluation on      the study of what works, for whom and in what circumstances. These relationships       are constructed as context-mechanisms-outcomes (CMO) configurations.      MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire was distributed to all nurses working in in-patient      units of a university hospital in Spain (n=227). Quantitative data were analysed       using SPSS 13.0. Descriptive statistics were used for an overall overview of      nurses' perception. Inferential analysis, including both bivariate and      multivariate methods (path analysis), was used for cross-tabulation of variables       searching for CMO relationships. RESULTS: Nurses (n=179) participated in the      study (78.8% response rate). Overall satisfaction with the IT system was      positive. Comparisons with context variables show how nursing units' context had       greater influence on perceptions than users' characteristics. Path analysis      illustrated that the influence of unit context variables are on outcomes and not       on mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Results from the study looking at subtle variations in      users and units provide insight into how important professional culture and      working practices could be in IT (information technology) implementation. The      socio-technical approach on IT systems evaluation suggested in the recent      literature appears to be an adequate theoretical underpinning for IT evaluation      research. Realistic evaluation has proven to be an adequate method for IT      evaluation.

PMID- 19766532   - The Millennium Villages Project (MVP), based at The Earth Institute at Columbia      University, is a bottom-up, community led approach to show how villages in      developing countries can get out of the poverty trap that afflicts more than a      billion people worldwide. With well-targeted, practical inputs can help the      community invest in a path leading to self-sustaining development. There are 80      Millennium Villages clustered in 10 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. MVP       is an important development process for empowering communities to invest in a      package of integrated interventions aiming to increase food production, improve      access to safe water, health care, education and infrastructure. The process      benefits from synergies of the integrated approach and relies on community      leadership as empowered by proven technological inputs. MVP is committed to a      science-based approach to assess and monitor the progress of the communities      towards clear objectives; the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to do so      with mechanisms that are scalable and sustainable. This approach offers much more      than simply collecting and analyzing data since the mechanism used for recording       progress would provide a bridge over the divide which separates the haves and the      have-nots (by facilitating the sharing of solutions from one community to another     bidirectionally). By so doing, it allows people to enhance their own futures in a      sustainable manner. Solutions found in one community are transferable to similar       communities in other MVP villages. To achieve this goal, the MVP requires an      information and communication system which can provide both necessary      infrastructure for monitoring and evaluation, and tools for communicating among      the villages, cities and countries. This system is called the Millennium Global      Village-Net (MGV-Net). It takes advantage of the latest in open source software      (OpenMRS), databases (MySQL), interface terminology, a centralized concept      dictionary, and uses appropriate technology locally for data entry.

PMID- 19766054   - OBJECTIVES: In this paper we present a method for processing and presentation of       data recorded through structured observation of clinicians' information and      communication activities. The activities are encoded as sequences of distinctive       speech acts, and resulting profiles of communicative behaviour are visualized in       radar graphs. Example profiles resulting from the analysis of three clinicians'      communicative behaviour during pre-rounds meetings and medication activities are       given. METHODS: The communicative acts profiles are based on empirical data from       an observational study performed at a Norwegian university hospital. A fifth-year     medical student spent 20 days in two different hospital wards, following one      physician at a time in daily, patient-centred work. The observer recorded the      clinicians' information and communication activities during several ward      situations such as pre-rounds meetings, ward rounds, and patient discharge. The      data was recorded by means of an observation form consisting of a mixture of      codes and free-text fields. The recorded data was post-processed by associating      each event with one predefined communicative act, and resulting profiles for     three individual physicians in different situations have been created as radar     graphs. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The approach is an efficient and useful means for     studying clinicians' information and communication patterns in hospital wards.      The method can be used to illustrate variations among individual clinicians in      similar situations and to compare profiles of different roles or hospital wards.       Given proper validation, the approach may serve as an important tool to inform      the design of new clinical information systems.

PMID- 19740700   - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are: In this approach, the implementation      of such a complex IT solution is considered a major redesign of the work system.       The paper describes the Human Factor (HF) tasks embedded in the project      lifecycle: (1) analysis and modelling of the current work system and usability      assessment of the medication CPOE solution; (2) HF recommendations for work      re-design and usability recommendations for IT system re-engineering both aiming       at a safer and more efficient work situation. METHODS: Standard ethnographic      methods were used to support the analysis of the current work system and work      situations, coupled with cognitive task analysis methods and documents review.      Usability inspection (heuristic evaluation) and both in-lab (simulated tasks) and      on-site (real tasks) usability tests were performed for the evaluation of the      CPOE candidate. Adapted software engineering models were used in combination with      usual textual descriptions, tasks models and mock-ups to support the      recommendations for work and product re-design. RESULTS: The analysis of the work      situations identified different work organisations and procedures across the      hospital's departments. The most important differences concerned the doctor-nurse      communications and cooperation modes and the procedures for preparing and      administering the medications. The assessment of the medication CPOE functions      uncovered a number of usability problems including severe ones leading to      impossible to detect or to catch errors. Models of the actual and possible      distribution of tasks and roles were used to support decision making in the work       design process. The results of the usability assessment were translated into      requirements to support the necessary re-engineering of the IT application.      CONCLUSION: The HFE approach to medication CPOE efficiently identifies and      distinguishes currently unsafe or uncomfortable work situations that could      obviously benefit from an IT solution from other work situations incorporating      efficient work procedures that might be impaired by the implementation of the      CPOE. In this context, a careful redesign of the work situation and of the entire      work system is necessary to actually benefit from the installation of the product      in terms of patient safety and human performances. In parallel, a usability      assessment of the product to be implemented is mandatory to identify potentially       dangerous usability flaws and to fix them before the installation.

PMID- 19734085   - PURPOSE: Countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have invested in health      information and communication technologies. Since eHealth challenges cross      borders a European Union-United States of America conference on public policies      relating to health IT and eHealth was held October 20-21, 2008 in Paris, France.       PROCESS: The conference was organized around the four themes: (1) privacy and      security, (2) health IT interoperability, (3) deployment and adoption of health      IT, and (4) Public Private Collaborative Governance. The four key themes framed      the discussion over the two days of plenary sessions and workshops. RESULTS: Key       findings of the conference were organized along the four themes. (1) Privacy and       security: Patients' access to their own data and key elements of a patient      identification management framework were discussed. (2) Health IT      interoperability: Three significant and common interoperability challenges      emerged: (a) the need to establish common or compatible standards and clear     guidelines for their implementation, (b) the desirability for shared      certification criteria and (c) the need for greater awareness of the importance      of interoperability. (3) Deployment and adoption of health IT: Three major areas       of need emerged: (a) a shared knowledge base and assessment framework, (b)      public-private collaboration and (c) and effective organizational change      strategies. (4) Public Private Collaborative Governance: Sharing and      communication are central to success in this area. Nations can learn from one      another about ways to develop harmonious, effective partnerships. CONCLUSIONS:      Three areas that were identified as highest priority for collaboration included:       (1) health data security, (2) developing effective strategies to ensure      healthcare professionals' acceptance of health IT tools, and (3)      interoperability.

PMID- 19717335   - PURPOSE: This is an exploratory study carrying out qualitative research into the       perceptions, attitudes and concerns of elderly persons towards wireless sensor     network (WSN) technologies in terms of their application to healthcare. This work      aims to provide guidance on the dimensions and items that may be included in the       development of a more in-depth questionnaire to further validate the importance      of the identified factors as well as the relationships between them. This study      aims to contribute to opening up a communication channel between users and      researchers, informing the research community in relation to applications and      functionalities that users deem as either desirable, inadequate or in need of      further development. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with elderly      individuals who were still living independently. To explore elderly persons'      perceptions and thoughts on current wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies      and designs, discussion points were designed from concepts identified from      various user acceptance theories and models. Participants were given an      introduction to explain the functionality and capabilities of WSN and motes and      were shown a sample mote, the Crossbow Mica2Dot. Participants were then asked to       discuss their perceptions and concerns towards the likelihood of using a      WSN-based healthcare system in their home. FINDINGS: We have identified sixteen      concepts in relation to the elderly participants' perception, concerns and      attitudes towards WSN systems. Those concepts were further classified into six      themes describing the determinants that may affect an elderly person's acceptance      of WSNs for assisting healthcare. Some of our exploratory findings in this study       indicate for example that independence is highly valued by elderly people and      hence any system or technology that can prolong that independence tends to be      highly regarded, that privacy of WSN health data might not be as important as      typically considered, and there are also indications that cost may be the most      prominent determinant influencing an elderly person's acceptance of WSNs.      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that participants' attitudes towards the idea       of wireless sensor networks for health monitoring are generally positive. The      exploratory findings along with the literature suggest a number of relationships       which can be used in future survey design and model building.

PMID- 19716762   - BACKGROUND: Many consumers join online communities focused on health. Online      forums are a popular medium for the exchange of health information between      consumers, so it is important to determine the accuracy and completeness of      information posted to online forums. OBJECTIVE: We compared the accuracy and      completeness of information regarding the FDA-approved over-the counter     weight-loss drug Alli (Orlistat) from forums and from clinicians. METHODS: We      identified Alli-related questions posted on online forums and then posed the      questions to 11 primary care providers. We then compared the clinicians' answers       to the answers given on the forums. A panel of blinded experts evaluated the      accuracy and completeness of the answers on a scale of 0-4. Another panel of      blinded experts categorized questions as being best answered based on clinical      experience versus review of the literature. RESULTS: The accuracy and      completeness of clinician responses was slightly better than forum responses, but      there was no significant difference (2.3 vs. 2.1, p=0.5). Only one forum answer     contained information that could potentially cause harm if the advice was      followed. CONCLUSIONS: Forum answers were comparable to clinicians' answers with       respect to accuracy and completeness, but answers from both sources were      unsatisfactory.

PMID- 19660983   - Companies developing and commercializing Healthcare IT applications may decide to      involve the users in the software development lifecycle in order to better     understand the users' needs and to optimize their products. Unfortunately direct       developers-users dialogues are not sufficient to ensure a proper understanding of      the users' needs. It is also necessary to involve human factors specialists to      analyze the users' expression of their needs and to properly formalize the      requirements for design purposes. The objective of this paper is to present a      case study reporting the collaborative work between HF experts and a company      developing and commercializing a CPOE. This study shows how this collaboration      helps resolve the limits of direct users involvement and usual problems      pertaining to users' needs description and understanding. METHOD: The company      participating in the study has implemented a procedure to convene regular     meetings allowing direct exchanges between the development team and users'      representatives. Those meetings aim at getting users' feedbacks on the existing      products and at validating further developments. In parallel with usual HF      methods supporting the analysis of the work system (onsite observations followed       by debriefing interviews) and the usability evaluation of the application      (usability inspection and usability tests), HF experts took the opportunity of      the meetings organized by the company to collect, re-interpret and re-formulate      the needs expressed by the users. RESULTS: The developers perceive the      physicians' requirements concerning the display of the patient's list of      medication as contradictory. In a previous meeting round the users had required a      detailed view of the medication list against the synthesized existing one. Once      this requirement satisfied, the users participating in the current meeting round       require a synthesized view against the existing detailed one. The development      team is unable to understand what they perceive as a reverse claim. Relying on a       cognitive analysis of the physicians' decision making concerning the patient's      treatment, the HF experts help re-formulate the physicians' cognitive needs in      terms of synthesized/detailed display of the medication list depending on the      stage of the decision making process. This led to an astute re-engineering of the      application allowing the physicians to easily navigate back and forth between the      synthesized and detailed views depending on the progress of their decision      making. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the integration of users'      representatives in the software lifecycle is a good point for the end users. But       it remains insufficient to resolve the complex usability problems of the system.       Such solutions require the integration of HF expertise. Moreover, such an      involvement of HF experts may generate benefits in terms of reduction of (i) the       number of iterative developments and (ii) the users' training costs.

PMID- 19656719   - The resulting regional healthcare information systems were expected to have      effects and impacts on health care procedures, work practices and treatment      outcomes. The aim is to find out how health information systems have been      investigated, what has been investigated and what are the outcomes. A systematic       review was carried out of the research on the regional health information systems      or organizations. The literature search was conducted on four electronic Cinahl      Medline, Medline/PubMed and Cochrane. The common type of study design was the      survey research and case study, and the data collection was carried out via      different methodologies. They found out different types of regional health      information systems (RHIS). The systems were heterogeneous and were in different       phases of these developments. The RHIS outcomes focused on the five main areas:      flow of information, collaboration, process redesign, system usability and      organization culture. The RHIS improved the clinical data access, timely      information, and clinical data exchange and improvement in communication and      coordination within a region between professionals but also there was inadequate       access to patient relevant clinical data. There were differences in organization       culture, vision and expectations of leadership and consistency of strategic plan.      Nevertheless, there were widespread participation by both healthcare providers      and patients.

PMID- 19643661   - PURPOSE: The present study evaluated whether an intervention using a short      message service (SMS) by cellular phone and Internet would improve blood      pressure, weight control, and serum lipids of obese patients with hypertension      during 8 weeks. METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental design with pre- and      follow-up tests. Participants were recruited from the family medicine outpatient       department of tertiary care hospital located in an urban city of South Korea.      Twenty-eight patients were assigned to an intervention group and 21 to a control       group. The goal of intervention was to bring blood pressure, body weight, and      serum lipids levels close to normal ranges. Patients in the intervention group      were requested to record their blood pressure and body weight in a weekly web      based diary through the Internet or by cellular phones. The researchers sent      optimal recommendations as an intervention to each patient, by both cellular     phone and Internet weekly. The intervention was applied for 8 weeks. RESULTS:      Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) significantly decreased by 9.1      and 7.2 mmHg respectively at 8 weeks from the baseline in the intervention group       (p<0.05). However, after 8 weeks from the baseline both SBP and DBP in the      control group had not changed significantly. Yet, There were significant mean      decreases in body weight and waist circumference by 1.6 kg (p<0.05) and 2.8 cm      (p<0.05) in the intervention group, respectively. In the control group increases       in body weight and waist circumference (p<0.05) mean changes were also      significant. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) significantly      increased, with a mean change of 3.7 mg/dl at 8 weeks from baseline in the      intervention group (p<0.05). The mean change of HDL-C in the control group was,      however, not significant. CONCLUSION: During 8 weeks using this web-based      intervention by way of cellular phone and Internet SMS improved blood pressure,      body weight, waist circumference, and HDL-C in patients with obese hypertension.

PMID- 19640779   - BACKGROUND: Nursing is arguably the most organizationally diverse healthcare      profession. Educational backgrounds may vary, even among similarly credentialed      nurses. Drug information databases used as clinical decision support tools can      improve access to pharmacologic information at point-of-care when housed on      personal digital assistants. They may also help address the disparity in drug      information and pharmacology education between nurses. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate      nursing-specific drug information database content on personal digital assistants      (PDAs). METHODS: Seven nursing-specific PDA databases were evaluated for scope      (absence or presence of an answer) and completeness (three-point scale) via the      use of 80 general category and 80 subspecialty drug information questions.      Erroneous information was also tracked. Individual scope and completeness scores       were delineated by rank order and chi square was performed to determine      differences in scope and completeness scores between the databases. RESULTS:      Davis's Drug Guide for Nurses (DDGN) and Nursing Lexi-Drugs (NLD) tied for the      highest scores for scope, including each answering 72.5% of the 160 evaluation      questions. No significant differences existed between their scores and those      earned by Nursing2008 Drug Handbook (p<0.05). The highest scores for completeness      were earned by NLD with 58.1% and DDGN at 57.1%. Saunders Nursing Drug Handbook      was the only database that showed a significantly lower score in completeness as       compared to the other six databases (p<0.05). A 4.2% overall error rate was found      among database answers. DISCUSSION: Significant differences were found among the       performances in the databases evaluated in this study for their ability to answer     commonly encountered drug information issues in nursing practice. All databases      contained some erroneous information and even the top performers failed to      provide answers to more than one-fourth of the questions posed. The availability       of accurate and timely drug information at point-of-care can play a vital role in      patient management and outcomes, but current resources that are available need to      be improved.

PMID- 19640778   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the human, social and organizational issues surrounding      a Computerized Physician Order Entry system for Laboratory ordering (CPOE-L)      implementation process and to analyze their interrelated effects on the system      implementation failure in an academic medical setting. Second, to provide lessons      learned and recommendations on to how to manage challenges of human, social and      organizational nature surrounding CPOE-L implementations. METHODS: The themes      surrounding CPOE introduction were identified by a heuristic analysis of      literature on CPOE implementations. The resulting set of themes was applied as a       reference model for 20 semi-structured interviews conducted during the CPOE-L      implementation process with 11 persons involved in the CPOE-L project and in      reviewing all CPOE-L related project documentation. Data was additionally      gathered by user questionnaires, by user discussion rounds and through an      ethnographical study performed at the involved clinical and laboratory      departments. In analyzing the interview transcripts, project documentation and      data from user questionnaires and discussion rounds a grounded theory approach      was applied by the evaluation team to identify problem areas or issues deserving       further analysis. RESULTS: Outlined central problem areas concerning the CPOE-L      implementation and their mutual relations were depicted in a conceptual      interpretative model. Understanding of clinical workflow was identified as a key       theme pressured by organizational, human and social issues ultimately influencing      the entire implementation process in a negative way. Vast delays in CPOE      introduction, system immaturity and under-functionality could all be directly      attributed to a superficial understanding of workflow. Consequently, final CPOE      integration into clinical and laboratory workflows was inhibited by both      end-users as well as department managers and withdrawal of the CPOE-L system      became inevitable. CONCLUSION: This case study demonstrates which human, social      and organizational issues relevant to CPOE implementation cumulatively led to a      failure outcome of the CPOE-L pilot introduction. The experiences and      considerations described in this paper show important issues for CPOE systems to       be successfully introduced and to be taken into account in future CPOE      implementations. Understanding and consideration of (clinical) workflow aspects      by project managers and the involved clinical organization is of extreme      importance from the very start of a CPOE implementation process.

PMID- 19631581   - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) lowering medications have impressive efficacy in       reducing cardiovascular and renal events; but low adherence threatens their     effectiveness. Analysis of patterns in electronic prescribing from electronic      medical records (EMRs) may have the potential to reveal cohorts of patients with       significant adherence problems. METHODS: We developed a computational framework      to identify patient cohorts with poor adherence to long-term medication through      analysis of electronic prescribing patterns. A range of quality reporting      criteria can be specified (as an XML document). We illustrate the framework by      application to the EMRs of a New Zealand general practice with a focus on      adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) and/or     angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients classified with hypertension       and diabetes. We analyse medication supply based on Medication Possession Ratio      (MPR) and duration of lapse in ACE-inhibitors/ARBs over a 12-month evaluation      period. We describe graphical tools to assist visualisation of prescribing      patterns and relationship of the analysis outputs to controlled blood pressure.      RESULTS: Out of a cohort of 16,504 patient EMRs, 192 patients were found      classified with both hypertension and diabetes and under active ACE-inhibitor     and/or ARB management. Of these, 107 (56%) patients had an ACE-inhibitor/ARB MPR       less than 80% together with a lapse in ACE-inhibitors/ARBs for greater than 30      days. We find non-adherent patients (i.e. MPR <80% or lapse >30 days) are three      times more likely to have poor BP than adherent patients (odds ratio=3.055;      p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a generic computational framework that      can be used to formulate and query criteria around issues of adherence to      long-term medication based on practice EMRs. Within the context of the example we      have used, the observed adherence levels indicate that a substantial proportion      of patients classified with hypertension and diabetes have poor adherence,      associated with poorer rates of blood pressure control, that can be detected      through analysis of electronic prescribing. Further work is required to identify       effective interventions using the reporting information to reduce non-adherence      and improve patient outcomes.

PMID- 19625210   - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that can enhance the use of e-consultation in      primary care. We investigated the barriers, demands and motivations regarding      e-consultation among patients with no e-consultation experience (non-users).      METHODS: We used an online survey to gather data. Via online banners on 26      different websites of patient organizations we recruited primary care patients      with chronic complaints, an important target group for e-consultation. A      regression analysis was performed to identify the main drivers for e-consultation      use among patients with no e-consultation experience. RESULTS: In total, 1706      patients started to fill out the survey. Of these patients 90% had no prior     e-consultation experience. The most prominent reasons for non-use of      e-consultation use were: not being aware of the existence of the service, the      preference to see a doctor and e-consultation not being provided by a GP.      Patients were motivated to use e-consultation, because e-consultation makes it      possible to contact a GP at any time and because it enabled patients to ask      additional questions after a visit to the doctor. The use of a Web-based triage      application for computer-generated advice was popular among patients desiring to       determine the need to see a doctor and for purposes of self-care. The patients'      motivations to use e-consultation strongly depended on demands being satisfied      such as getting a quick response. When looking at socio-demographic and      health-related characteristics it turned out that certain patient groups - the      elderly, the less-educated individuals, the chronic medication users and the      frequent GP visitors - were more motivated than other patient groups to use      e-consultation services, but were also more demanding. The less-educated      patients, for example, more strongly demanded instructions regarding      e-consultation use than the highly educated patients. CONCLUSION: In order to      foster the use of e-consultation in primary care both GPs and non-users must be      informed about the possibilities and consequences of e-consultation through      tailored education and instruction. We must also take into account patient      profiles and their specific demands regarding e-consultation. Special attention      should be paid to patients who can benefit the most from e-consultation while      also facing the greatest chance of being excluded from the service. As health      care continues to evolve towards a more patient-centred approach, we expect that       patient expectations and demands will be a major force in driving the adoption of      e-consultation.

PMID- 19620023   - OBJECTIVE: There has been a growth of home healthcare technology in rural areas.       However, a significant limitation has been the need for costly and repetitive      training in order for patients to efficiently use their home telemedicine unit      (HTU). This research describes the evaluation of an architecture for remote      training of patients in a telemedicine environment. This work examines the      viability of a remote training architecture called REmote Patient Education in a       Telemedicine Environment (REPETE). REPETE was implemented and evaluated in the      context of the IDEATel project, a large-scale telemedicine project, focusing on      Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in New York State. METHODS: A number of      qualitative and quantitative evaluation tools were developed and used to study      the effectiveness of the remote training sessions evaluating: (a) task      complexity, (b) changes in patient performance and (c) the communication between       trainer and patient. Specifically, the effectiveness of the training was      evaluated using a measure of web skills competency, a user satisfaction survey, a      cognitive task analysis and an interaction analysis. RESULTS: Patients not only      reported that the training was beneficial, but also showed significant      improvements in their ability to effectively perform tasks. Our qualitative      evaluations scrutinizing the interaction between the trainer and patient showed      that while there was a learning curve for both the patient and trainer when      negotiating the shared workspace, the mutually visible pointer used in REPETE      enhanced the computer-mediated instruction. CONCLUSIONS: REPETE is an effective      remote training tool for older adults in the telemedicine environment. Patients      demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to perform tasks on their       home telemedicine unit.

PMID- 19577956   - GOAL: To identify factors that could affect health care workers' (HCWs) adoption       of a website for communicating infection control guidelines. METHODS: In total,      20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCWs in 5 different      occupational groups and 4 different hospitals in the Netherlands and Germany. A      website communicating guidelines for the prevention and control of Methicillin      Resistant Staphylococcus aureus served as a casus. The HCWs, the majority of whom      had prior experience with the website, were asked to give their opinions about      factors that hinder or facilitate adoption of the website in practice. The      interviews were based on the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling      Causes in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation) model complemented by quality      criteria for health-related websites. This model encompasses different categories      of factors relevant to technology adoption in health care. RESULTS: A total of      361 interview statements were relevant to the four main categories of the PRECEDE      model, yielding the following observations: (1) Technological factors (72      statements): The usability, design, and relevance of the website were positively       valued. The website enabled HCWs to access contextually relevant information      quickly. The website's credibility was evaluated rather negatively, as      respondents perceived that the website's guidelines were not in concurrence with       the best available evidence and it was not clear to HCWs who created the website.      (2) Individual factors (85 statements): Respondents, particular infection control      professionals, showed individual resistance to the website because they preferred      to use their personal knowledge and experience (and communication with      colleagues) over online sources. (3) Work-related factors (53 statements):      Respondents perceived high work pressure during working hours as an impediment to      consulting the website. In contrast, respondents thought the website might lower       work pressure for infection control professionals, as they will receive fewer     questions from HCWs. (4) Organizational factors (131 statements): Interpersonal      (face-to-face) communication between HCWs from different occupational groups in      both a formal (training) and informal (feedback) manner was seen as the most      stimulating factor behind website use. The respondents identified infection      control nurses as the most important opinion leaders. CONCLUSION: Factors from      multiple categories determine HCWs' adoption of web-based guidelines, but the      organization appeared to be a paramount reinforcer of initiation and maintenance       of technology adoption among HCWs. In order eliminate resistance and create      ownership among HCWs toward the website, leading to a willingness to integrate      the website into routine care, it is essential to more actively involve HCWs in      the early phases of the design process.

PMID- 19560962   - PURPOSE: Electronic medical records (EMRs) have become part of daily practice for     many physicians. Attempts have been made to apply electronic search engine      technology to speed EMR review. This was a prospective, observational study to      compare the speed and clinical accuracy of a medical record search engine vs.      manual review of the EMR. METHODS: Three raters reviewed 49 cases in the EMR to      screen for eligibility in a depression study using the electronic medical record       search engine (EMERSE). One week later raters received a scrambled set of the      same patients including 9 distractor cases, and used manual EMR review to      determine eligibility. For both methods, accuracy was assessed for the original      49 cases by comparison with a gold standard rater. RESULTS: Use of EMERSE      resulted in considerable time savings; chart reviews using EMERSE were      significantly faster than traditional manual review (p=0.03). The percent      agreement of raters with the gold standard (e.g. concurrent validity) using      either EMERSE or manual review was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS:      Using a search engine optimized for finding clinical information in the free-text      sections of the EMR can provide significant time savings while preserving      clinical accuracy. The major power of this search engine is not from a more      advanced and sophisticated search algorithm, but rather from a user interface      designed explicitly to help users search the entire medical record in a way that       protects health information.

PMID- 19556162   - PURPOSE: Our study was designed to find whether a change in physician ordering of      laboratory testing could be obtained by the simple strategy of changing the      set-up of the check-box laboratory order form that is embedded in a computerized       medical record. METHODS: This prospective intervention study was undertaken in      Maccabi Healthcare Services, a Preferred Provider Organization that has used a      computerized medical record since 1992. We examined data from 865 primary      healthcare physicians over 3 years. In May 2005 we changed the order form and      reduced the number of tests that can be ordered using a check-box form from 51 to      26. Twenty-seven tests were removed from the form and two tests were added. The      total number of laboratory test orders and the median rate of test orders per     visit to physician during each of the study periods were calculated separately      for each test. RESULTS: Tests that were added to the computerized laboratory      order form showed an increase of 60.7% in the first year and a further 90%      increase in the following year. For the unchanged tests the percentage changes      over the same periods were +18.4% and -22.4%. For the deleted tests the change      was -27% and -19.2% for the respective years. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in format of      laboratory test order forms can change physician test ordering and may be useful       together with other interventions to improve appropriateness of laboratory      testing. A thoughtfully built test ordering form can reinforce clinical      guidelines for the performance of some preventive testing and follow-up.

PMID- 19546026   - PURPOSE: Medical images are a significant information source for clinical      decision-making. Currently available information retrieval and decision support      systems rely primarily on the text of scientific publications to find evidence in      support of clinical information needs. The images and illustrations are available      only within the full text of a scientific publication and do not directly      contribute evidence to such systems. Our first goal is to explore whether image      features facilitate finding relevant images that appear in publications. Our     second goal is to find promising approaches for providing clinical evidence at      the point of service, leveraging information contained in the text and images.      METHODS: We studied two approaches to finding illustrative evidence: a supervised      machine-learning approach, in which images are classified as being relevant to an      information need or not, and a pipeline information retrieval approach, in which       images were retrieved using associated text and then re-ranked using      content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques. RESULTS: Our information      retrieval approach did not benefit from combining textual and image information.       However, given sufficient training data for the machine-learning approach, we      achieved 56% average precision at 94% recall using textual features, and 27%      average precision at 86% recall using image features. Combining these classifiers      resulted in improvement up to 81% precision at 96% recall (74% recall at 85%      precision, on average) for the requests with over 180 positive training examples.      CONCLUSIONS: Our supervised machine-learning methods that combine information      from image and text are capable of achieving image annotation and retrieval      accuracy acceptable for providing clinical evidence, given sufficient training      data.

PMID- 19501018   - Protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction is an important and widely      researched task in the biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) field.      Kernel-based machine learning methods have been used widely to extract PPI      automatically, and several kernels focusing on different parts of sentence      structure have been published for the PPI task. In this paper, we propose a      method to combine kernels based on several syntactic parsers, in order to      retrieve the widest possible range of important information from a given      sentence. We evaluate the method using a support vector machine (SVM), and we      achieve better results than other state-of-the-art PPI systems on four out of      five corpora. Further, we analyze the compatibility of the five corpora from the       viewpoint of PPI extraction, and we see that some of them have small      incompatibilities, but they can still be combined with a little effort.

PMID- 19501017   - BACKGROUND: Web 2.0 internet tools and methods have attracted considerable      attention as a means to improve health care delivery. Despite evidence      demonstrating their use by medical professionals, there is no detailed research      describing how Web 2.0 influences physicians' daily clinical practice. Hence this      study examines Web 2.0 use by 35 junior physicians in clinical settings to      further understand their impact on medical practice. METHOD: Diaries and      interviews encompassing 177 days of internet use or 444 search incidents,      analyzed via thematic analysis. RESULTS: Results indicate that 53% of internet      visits employed user-generated or Web 2.0 content, with Google and Wikipedia used      by 80% and 70% of physicians, respectively. Despite awareness of information      credibility risks with Web 2.0 content, it has a role in information seeking for       both clinical decisions and medical education. This is enabled by the ability to       cross check information and the diverse needs for background and non-verified      information. CONCLUSION: Web 2.0 use represents a profound departure from      previous learning and decision processes which were normally controlled by senior     medical staff or medical schools. There is widespread concern with the risk of      poor quality information with Web 2.0 use, and the manner in which physicians are      using it suggest effective use derives from the mitigating actions by the      individual physician. Three alternative policy options are identified to manage      this risk and improve efficiency in Web 2.0's use.

PMID- 19497782   - BACKGROUND: Predicting the survival of heart-lung transplant patients has the      potential to play a critical role in understanding and improving the matching      procedure between the recipient and graft. Although voluminous data related to      the transplantation procedures is being collected and stored, only a small subset      of the predictive factors has been used in modeling heart-lung transplantation      outcomes. The previous studies have mainly focused on applying statistical      techniques to a small set of factors selected by the domain-experts in order to      reveal the simple linear relationships between the factors and survival. The      collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers significant advantages over     conventional statistical techniques in dealing with the latter's limitations such      as normality assumption of observations, independence of observations from each      other, and linearity of the relationship between the observations and the output       measure(s). There are statistical methods that overcome these limitations. Yet,      they are computationally more expensive and do not provide fast and flexible      solutions as do data mining techniques in large datasets. PURPOSE: The main      objective of this study is to improve the prediction of outcomes following      combined heart-lung transplantation by proposing an integrated data-mining      methodology. METHODS: A large and feature-rich dataset (16,604 cases with 283      variables) is used to (1) develop machine learning based predictive models and      (2) extract the most important predictive factors. Then, using three different      variable selection methods, namely, (i) machine learning methods driven      variables-using decision trees, neural networks, logistic regression, (ii) the      literature review-based expert-defined variables, and (iii) common sense-based      interaction variables, a consolidated set of factors is generated and used to      develop Cox regression models for heart-lung graft survival. RESULTS: The      predictive models' performance in terms of 10-fold cross-validation accuracy      rates for two multi-imputed datasets ranged from 79% to 86% for neural networks,       from 78% to 86% for logistic regression, and from 71% to 79% for decision trees.       The results indicate that the proposed integrated data mining methodology using      Cox hazard models better predicted the graft survival with different variables      than the conventional approaches commonly used in the literature. This result is       validated by the comparison of the corresponding Gains charts for our proposed      methodology and the literature review based Cox results, and by the comparison of      Akaike information criteria (AIC) values received from each. CONCLUSIONS: Data      mining-based methodology proposed in this study reveals that there are      undiscovered relationships (i.e. interactions of the existing variables) among      the survival-related variables, which helps better predict the survival of the      heart-lung transplants. It also brings a different set of variables into the      scene to be evaluated by the domain-experts and be considered prior to the organ       transplantation.

PMID- 19482544   - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Inter-clinician communication accounts for more than half of all      information exchanges within the health care system. A non-participatory,      qualitative time-and-motion observational study was conducted in order to gain a       better understanding of inter-clinician communication behaviors, routine workflow      patterns, and the use of information communication technologies (ICTs) within the      clinical workspace. METHOD: Over a 5-day period, seven attending physicians and      two nurses were shadowed for 2-4h at a time. Inter-clinician communication events      were tracked in real-time using synchronized digital stopwatches. Observations      were recorded on a paper-based, semi-structured observation tool and later coded       for analysis. RESULTS: Nine hundred and eighty-seven communication events were      observed over 2024.67 min. Clinicians were observed to spend the majority of      their time on patient care (85.4% in this study) with about three-fourths of that      time spent on indirect patient care (e.g. charting). Clinicians were observed to       prefer using synchronous communication modes, which led to multitasking and      created a highly interrupted workflow. Forty-two percent (n=415) of communication      events were coded as interruptions and study participants were seen multitasking       14.8% of the time. Though each interruption was short-lived (on average      0.98+/-2.24 min for attending physicians), they occurred frequently. Both      attending physicians and nurses were the recipients of more interruptions than      they initiated. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the clinical workspace      is a highly interruptive environment. Multiple interruptions in the communication      processes between clinicians consume time and have the potential to increase the       risk of error. This workflow analysis may inform the development of communication      devices to enhance inter-clinician communication by reducing interruptions or     deferring interruptions to more appropriate times.

PMID- 19482543   - BACKGROUND: Electronic patient records (EPRs) contain a large amount of      information written in free text. This information is considered very valuable      for research but is also very sensitive since the free text parts may contain      information that could reveal the identity of a patient. Therefore, methods for     de-identifying EPRs are needed. The work presented here aims to perform a manual       and automatic Protected Health Information (PHI)-annotation trial for EPRs      written in Swedish. METHODS: This study consists of two main parts: the initial      creation of a manually PHI-annotated gold standard, and the porting and      evaluation of an existing de-identification software written for American English      to Swedish in a preliminary automatic de-identification trial. Results are      measured with precision, recall and F-measure. RESULTS: This study reports fairly      high Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) results on the manually created gold      standard, especially for specific tags such as names. The average IAA over all      tags was 0.65 F-measure (0.84 F-measure highest pairwise agreement). For name      tags the average IAA was 0.80 F-measure (0.91 F-measure highest pairwise      agreement). Porting a de-identification software written for American English to       Swedish directly was unfortunately non-trivial, yielding poor results.      CONCLUSION: Developing gold standard sets as well as automatic systems for     de-identification tasks in Swedish is feasible. However, discussions and      definitions on identifiable information is needed, as well as further     developments both on the tag sets and the annotation guidelines, in order to get       a reliable gold standard. A completely new de-identification software needs to be      developed.

PMID- 19482542   - OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess expectations and experiences of a new eHealth service      by patients and staff in three primary care settings; (2) to ascertain attitudes       to a range of future, primary care-oriented eHealth services. DESIGN: Qualitative      case study. SETTING: Three UK general practices introducing an eHealth service      for booking patient appointments. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety patients purposively      selected from users and non-users of the new service and 28 staff (clinicians,      management and administrative staff). RESULTS: Actual patient use of the service       was lower than stated intention. Patients and staff felt that more active      promotion of the service would have resulted in more use. Low usage did not      result in a negative assessment of the service by most staff. Different patient      groupings were identified with characteristics that may be used as predictors of       eHealth service use and indicators of training needs. GPs and patients expressed       opposing viewpoints on a range of future eHealth services. CONCLUSIONS: Take-up      of eHealth services may be lower than expected. To overcome patient barriers,      factors that may narrow the intention-behaviour gap such as level of service      promotion, GP endorsement, and usage by different patient groups, should be      investigated. For clinician barriers, the eHealth evidence base needs      strengthening, while for primary care practices, a learning process including      staff training needs to be instituted. The differing views of patients and GPs      about components of eHealth means that policymakers need to plan for a lengthy      political process to obtain agreement on contentious issues if they are to      achieve successful eHealth services.

PMID- 19482511   - PURPOSE: This study examined the extent to which the ISO reference terminology      model for nursing actions represents oriental nursing actions in a computerized      nursing documentation system to share data and foster communication between      oriental nursing care and conventional nursing care. METHODS: The narrative      nursing notes of 545 patients retrieved from a nursing documentation system in an      oriental medicine teaching hospital were analyzed. Among 49,118 entries, 933 were      recorded as nursing actions. Each entry was decomposed in a set of single      statements. A total of 1209 nursing action statements were derived and mapped to       the components of the model. These processes were reviewed and validated by two      domain experts and a nursing terminology expert. RESULTS: All of the oriental      nursing actions documented contained a word or phrase that described the Action      and Target in the model. The Recipient of Care was expressed explicitly in 1.2%      of statements. The most frequently used Action terms were 'administering'      (19.7%), 'teaching' (16.5%), and 'explaining' (13.6%). The Target terms that      indicated unique oriental nursing concepts included 'Sasang constitution      differentiation', 'removal of acupuncture needles', 'herb moxibustion', 'oriental      massage', and 'oriental medication'. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that      oriental nursing actions can be represented using the ISO reference terminology      model for nursing actions. Further specification of the components of the model      will be useful to achieve consistent mapping across different settings. The      addition of component qualifiers should also be taken into consideration to      describe nursing actions at a more granular level.

PMID- 19464941   - PURPOSE: Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published clinical datasets are       important part of medical research. By combining results of multiple studies,      meta-analysis is able to increase confidence in its conclusions, validate      particular study results, and sometimes lead to new findings. Extensive theory      has been built on how to aggregate results from multiple studies and arrive to      the statistically valid conclusions. Surprisingly, very little has been done to      adopt advanced machine learning methods to support meta-analysis. METHODS: In      this paper we describe a novel machine learning methodology that is capable of      inducing accurate and easy to understand attributional rules from aggregated      data. Thus, the methodology can be used to support traditional meta-analysis in      systematic reviews. Most machine learning applications give primary attention to       predictive accuracy of the learned knowledge, and lesser attention to its      understandability. Here we employed attributional rules, the special form of      rules that are relatively easy to interpret for medical experts who are not      necessarily trained in statistics and meta-analysis. RESULTS: The methodology has      been implemented and initially tested on a set of publicly available clinical      data describing patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective of this      application was to determine rules describing combinations of clinical parameters      used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis, and to develop rules for predicting      whether particular patients are likely to develop secondary complications of MS.       The aggregated clinical data was retrieved from 20 separate hospital cohorts that      included 12 groups of patients with present liver disease symptoms and 8 control       groups of healthy subjects. The total of 152 attributes were used, most of which       were measured, however, in different studies. Twenty most common attributes were       selected for the rule learning process. By applying the developed rule learning      methodology we arrived at several different possible rulesets that can be used to      predict three considered complications of MS, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver     disease (NAFLD), simple steatosis (SS), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

PMID- 19464231   - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare organizations are increasingly implementing electronic      health records (EHRs) and other related health information technology (IT). Even       in institutions which have long adopted these computerized systems, employees      continue to rely on paper to complete their work. The objective of this study was      to explore and understand human-technology integration factors that may be      causing employees to rely on paper alternatives to the EHR. METHODS: We conducted      semi-structured interviews with 20 key-informants in a large Veterans Affairs      Medical Center (VAMC), with a fully implemented EHR, to understand the use of      paper-based alternatives. Participants included clinicians, administrators, and      IT specialists across several service areas in the medical center. RESULTS: We      found 11 distinct categories of paper-based workarounds to the use of the EHR.      Paper use related to the following: (1) efficiency; (2) knowledge/skill/ease of      use; (3) memory; (4) sensorimotor preferences; (5) awareness; (6) task      specificity; (7) task complexity; (8) data organization; (9) longitudinal data      processes; (10) trust; and (11) security. We define each of these and provide      examples that demonstrate how these categories promoted paper use in spite of a      fully implemented EHR. CONCLUSIONS: In several cases, paper served as an      important tool and assisted healthcare employees in their work. In other cases,      paper use circumvented the intended EHR design, introduced potential gaps in      documentation, and generated possible paths to medical error. We discuss      implications of these findings for EHR design and implementation.

PMID- 19447071   - AIM: The aim was to implement and evaluate a standardised nursing record, using      patients with leg ulcer as an example, regarding the content of the nursing      record and district nurses' experiences of documentation. METHOD: This was a      prospective, stratified and randomised intervention study, with one intervention       group and one control group. A standardised nursing wound care record was      designed and implemented in the electronic patient record in the intervention      group for a period of 3 months. Pre- and post-intervention audits of nursing      records [n=102 and n=92, respectively] were carried out and 126 district nurses      answered questionnaires pre-intervention and 83 post-intervention. RESULT: The      standardised nursing wound care record led to more informative, comprehensive and      knowledge-intensive documentation according to the audit and district nurses'      opinions. Furthermore, the district nurses' self-reported knowledge of nursing      documentation increased in the intervention group. When the standardised nursing       wound care record was not used, the documentation was mostly incomplete with a      lack of nursing relevance. There were no differences in the district nurses'      experiences of documentation in general between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Using      the standardised nursing wound care record improved nursing documentation meeting      legal demands, which should increase the safety of patient. There was however a      discrepancy between the nurses stated knowledge and how they carried out the      documentation. Regular in-service training together with use of evidence based      standardised nursing records, as a link to clinical reasoning about nursing care,      could be ways effecting change.

PMID- 19447070   - INTRODUCTION: This paper explores the benefits of using n-grams and semantic      features for the classification of disease outbreak reports, in the context of      the BioCaster disease outbreak report text mining system. A novel feature of this      work is the use of a general purpose semantic tagger - the USAS tagger - to      generate features. BACKGROUND: We outline the application context for this work      (the BioCaster epidemiological text mining system), before going on to describe      the experimental data used in our classification experiments (the 1000 document      BioCaster corpus). FEATURE SETS: Three broad groups of features are used in this       work: Named Entity based features, n-gram features, and features derived from the      USAS semantic tagger. METHODOLOGY: Three standard machine learning algorithms -      Naive Bayes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, and the C4.5 decision tree      algorithm - were used for classifying experimental data (that is, the BioCaster     corpus). Feature selection was performed using the chi(2) feature selection      algorithm. Standard text classification performance metrics - Accuracy,      Precision, Recall, Specificity and F-score - are reported. RESULTS: A feature      representation composed of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and features derived from       a semantic tagger, in conjunction with the Naive Bayes algorithm and feature      selection yielded the highest classification accuracy (and F-score). This result       was statistically significant compared to a baseline unigram representation and      to previous work on the same task. However, it was feature selection rather than       semantic tagging that contributed most to the improved performance. CONCLUSION:      This study has shown that for the classification of disease outbreak reports, a      combination of bag-of-words, n-grams and semantic features, in conjunction with      feature selection, increases classification accuracy at a statistically      significant level compared to previous work in this domain.

PMID- 19428290   - Evidence-based dentistry has shown that different restorative materials have      different survival times. Our primary hypothesis is that this should be revealed       from normal dental records by the use of data mining technique and a      practice-based dentistry approach analysed in a scientifically sound way. Dental       records from 1626 patients and altogether 19,892 restorations in three Finnish      age cohorts were analysed. Survival curves (Kaplan-Meier) were drawn for each of       the restorative materials. Median survival times for amalgam and resin-based      composites were more than 15 years in older cohorts. More than 60% of silicate      cement restorations were replaced within 5 years, and more than 50% of glass      ionomers within 7 years. There was a significant reduction in the longevity of      amalgams in the 1980 cohort. Data mining of digital oral heath documents would be      a useful tool to analyse survival curves of new restorative materials in a      practice-based manner in real-life conditions.

PMID- 19423385   - INTRODUCTION: Data acquisition is still one of the important challenges to be met      in clinical settings. This is even more critic in settings with high cognitive      workloads, such as emergency room (ER). Observations in these settings are      difficult to realize without biases and there is little means to trace fine      acquisition activities done in natural environments, using pen and papers. This      study is based on the usage of a digital pen and paper (DPP) technology for the      acquisition of triage information by nurses in ER. The DPP technology has been      used to ease acquisition using a natural mechanism; it also minimizes the      external influence of observation during acquisition activities. The aim of this       study is to determine whether data recorded by the DPP technology allows      explaining how ER triage nurses use the triage forms in real working conditions.       METHODOLOGY: The chief physicians of the ER service wanted to have answers about       three main concerns pertaining to the triage process: (1) the average time spent       during the triage process; (2) the sequence in which the fields of the forms were      filled and; (3) the contribution of objective measurements, such as vital signs,       to the triage emergency level and decisions. In order to answer these questions,       detailed log data recorded by the DPP during form filling as been analyzed and      allowed to built several representations of the triage process. In addition, we      completed this analysis with ethnographical-like observations. RESULTS: For seven      consecutive days, 1183 triage forms have been recorded in the ER for all patients      admitted. Among them, 954 forms have been digitalized and 906 forms have been      considered as valid and complete. Based on this set of data, the median duration       of the triage process is 143 s. There are no converging habits in filling the      forms and the sequence of filling fields present a high variability. The emphasis      of the objective measurements in the decisional process is rather low, as vital      signs are recorded in less than 17% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The DPP technology       is an original approach to study data acquisition processes in unbiased      conditions. The technical raw data recorded by the DPP allows building the time      series of all activities on the paper, therefore letting to constructing several       representations of the process. However, the technology is not able to provide      information about the context of use, for example interruptions of the form      filling processes due to calls or other activities. Therefore, it is necessary to      complete these analyses with qualitative approaches such as observational studies      and interviews. Noticeably, as a result of this study, the head physicians of ER       have redesigned the triage form to enforce the use of objective measurements and       ease the data acquisition process.

PMID- 19398370   - INTRODUCTION: Information extraction (IE) systems have been proposed in recent      years to extract genic interactions from bibliographical resources. They are      limited to single interaction relations, and have to face a trade-off between      recall and precision, by focusing either on specific interactions (for     precision), or general and unspecified interactions of biological entities (for     recall). Yet, biologists need to process more complex data from literature, in      order to study biological pathways. An ontology is an adequate formal      representation to model this sophisticated knowledge. However, the tight      integration of IE systems and ontologies is still a current research issue, a      fortiori with complex ones that go beyond hierarchies. METHOD: We propose a rich       modeling of genic interactions with an ontology, and show how it can be used      within an IE system. The ontology is seen as a language specifying a normalized      representation of text. First, IE is performed by extracting instances from      natural language processing (NLP) modules. Then, deductive inferences on the      ontology language are completed, and new instances are derived from previously      extracted ones. Inference rules are learnt with an inductive logic programming      (ILP) algorithm, using the ontology as the hypothesis language, and its      instantiation on an annotated corpus as the example language. Learning is set in       a multi-class setting to deal with the multiple ontological relations. RESULTS:      We validated our approach on an annotated corpus of gene transcription      regulations in the Bacillus subtilis bacterium. We reach a global recall of 89.3%      and a precision of 89.6%, with high scores for the ten semantic relations defined      in the ontology.

PMID- 19395307   - INTRODUCTION: Drug allergy and interaction alerts are a core function of most      electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) systems. To characterize the value of      e-prescribing and medication safety alerts, especially in small and medium-size      practices, we undertook a hypothesis-generating focus group study of      Massachusetts clinicians. We sought to understand the reasons for adoption and      use of e-prescribing, as well as clinicians' complaints about and perceived      benefits of drug allergy and interaction alerts. METHODS: We recruited 25      Massachusetts clinicians to participate in three focus groups regarding the use      and value of e-prescribing and medication safety alerts. The participants      included high-volume (>100 electronic scripts per month) physicians, nurse      practitioners, and practice assistants in family practice, internal medicine,      pediatrics, and subspecialty practices who used a common commercial e-prescribing      system. RESULTS: Most clinicians were in small and medium-size group practices.      Participants were, on average, 25 years post-medical school graduation (range      8-36), had used e-prescribing for 2.5 years (range 1.0-5.5), and wrote the      majority (89%, range 15-100%) of prescriptions electronically. The participants'       decision to adopt e-prescribing was driven largely by financial incentives      offered by insurers, and was viewed as a step toward implementation of an      electronic medical record. Although participants agreed that the system was easy       to learn, few anticipated efficiencies were realized until clinicians configured       the device to meet their needs. The participants were ambivalent about whether     e-prescribing improved their own or overall office efficiency, and--in the      absence of payer incentives--few were willing to pay for the systems      out-of-pocket. The most valuable aspects of e-prescribing were the ease of      changing doses, renewing prescriptions, ensuring legibility, and transmitting      prescriptions to in- and out-of-state pharmacies. Participants were dissatisfied       with the unreliability of transmitting prescriptions successfully to the      pharmacy, and with their inability to merge duplicate patient entries, to create       a comprehensive, allprescriber medication list, to write prescriptions for     commonly ordered medications and supplies, and to enter allergy information into       the system. Participants were critical of the volume of drug allergy and      interaction alerts. Many alerts were of trivial clinical significance or were      generated by interactions with out-of-date medications. As a result, many      clinicians habitually ignored these alerts. Alerts were most helpful to      clinicians who were unfamiliar with a particular drug or patient. Although alerts      rarely led the clinicians to abort or alter a prescription, alerts did prompt      clinicians to counsel patients about medication side effects, to educate      themselves about potential interactions, to check physical examination findings,       or to order laboratory tests. Despite problems, few clinicians were willing to      forego receiving alerts for fear that they would miss a potentially dangerous      drug interaction. CONCLUSION: Electronic prescribing is a potential boon to      ambulatory medical practice, although its value may be compromised by      inappropriate and irrelevant medication safety alerts and by features of the      e-prescribing system that prove burdensome to frontline clinicians. While alerts       infrequently result in changed or aborted prescriptions, they may trigger a      variety of other provider behaviors that help to ensure safe care.

PMID- 19386540   - PURPOSE: To develop a powerful archetype editing framework capable of handling      multiple reference models and oriented towards the semantic description and      standardization of legacy data. METHODS: The main prerequisite for implementing      tools providing enhanced support for archetypes is the clear specification of      archetype semantics. We propose a formalization of the definition section of      archetypes based on types over tree-structured data. It covers the specialization      of archetypes, the relationship between reference models and archetypes and      conformance of data instances to archetypes. RESULTS: LinkEHR-Ed, a visual      archetype editor based on the former formalization with advanced processing      capabilities that supports multiple reference models, the editing and semantic      validation of archetypes, the specification of mappings to data sources, and the       automatic generation of data transformation scripts, is developed. CONCLUSIONS:      LinkEHR-Ed is a useful tool for building, processing and validating archetypes      based on any reference model.

PMID- 19375977   - PURPOSE: Clinical practice guidelines often contain ambiguities, inconsistencies,      and logical errors that hamper implementation of these guidelines in practice. As      guideline formalization is useful to verify the logical structure, consistency,      and completeness of guidelines, several authors have argued that the      formalization of guidelines concurrent with their development may improve their     quality. However, experiences with such a parallel guideline development and      formalization approach have not yet been reported. The goal of this study was to       develop such a strategy and evaluate its application in practice. METHODS:      Existing methodologies for guideline development and guideline formalization were      analyzed and used as a basis to develop a strategy in which guideline      formalization is performed concurrently with guideline development. The developed      strategy was applied in the development of a clinical practice guideline for     cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: A parallel guideline development and      formalization strategy was developed that intertwines the processes of guideline       development and guideline formalization. Central assets are early involvement of       guideline formalization specialists and formalization tools, cooperation between       guideline authors and guideline formalization specialists in the development of      clinical algorithms, access to domain knowledge when formalization identifies      inconsistencies or omissions, and formal verification of the guideline model      prior to guideline dissemination. This strategy was applied in the development of      a guideline for cardiac rehabilitation and helped to identify several vague and      inconsistent recommendations and impracticabilities in the narrative guidelines      that could be resolved before publication. In addition, the strategy ensured      consistency between the narrative and formalized guideline. CONCLUSIONS: Based on      our experience, formalizing a guideline concurrent with its development is      feasible in practice and we recommend applying such a strategy as it can be      beneficial to the quality of and consistency between the guideline's narrative      and formalized version.

PMID- 19375381   - BACKGROUND: The use of electronic patient records (EPR) by Irish GPs has grown      substantially over the past decade but a significant number of GPs continue to      use manual record systems. OBJECTIVES: This study attempts to determine the      factors which affect the uptake of an EPR by Irish GPs. METHODS AND MATERIALS:      Two national postal surveys of Irish General Practitioners (GPs) were carried out      in 2000 and again in 2003. Response rates were 69% (n=1543) and 60% (n=1408),      respectively. RESULTS: The data collected reveal that electronic patient records       are in widespread use among Irish general practitioners. Furthermore the study      shows that the use of electronic patient records for common clinical and      administrative tasks is increasing. Comparative analysis of the data revealed      statistically significant differences between subgroups of responders. GPs were      more likely to use an EPR for clinical tasks if they were young and male. GPs in       group practice and GPs with mostly state-funded patient lists were more likely to      use an EPR as were GPs in rural locations. Much higher use of an EPR for clinical      tasks was found among GPs who were involved in the training of newly qualified      GPs. The most significant perceived barrier preventing GPs migrating from manual       to electronic records was "lack of time". While lack of financial resources and      absence of computer skills were also perceived as barriers, these were found to      be less significant. DISCUSSION: While the increasing use of an EPR among younger     GPs was expected, the lower usage among female GPs and those in urban locations      was not and has not been previously reported. The data has important implications      for the planned roll out of electronic patient records as outlined in Ireland's      National Health Information Strategy.

PMID- 19369114   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: EpiData and Epi Info are often used together by public      health agencies around the world, particularly in developing countries, to meet      their needs of low-cost public health data management; however, the current open       source data management technology lacks a mobile component to meet the needs of      mobile public health data collectors. The goal of this project is to explore the       opportunity of filling this gap through developing and trial of a personal      digital assistant (PDA) based data collection/entry system. It evaluated whether       such a system could increase efficiency and reduce data transcription errors for       public surveillance data collection in developing countries represented by Fiji.       METHODS: A generic PDA-based data collection software eSTEPS was developed. The      software and the data collected using it directly interfaces with EpiData. A      field trial was conducted to test the viability of public health surveillance      data collection using eSTEPS. The design was a randomised, controlled trial with       cross-over design. 120 participants recruited from the Fiji School of Medicine      were randomly assigned to be interviewed by one of six interviewers in one of the      two ways: (1) paper-based survey followed by PDA survey and (2) PDA survey      followed by paper-based survey. Data quality was measured by error rates (logical      range errors/inconsistencies, skip errors, missing values, date or time field      errors and incorrect data type). Work flow and cost were evaluated in three      stages of the survey process: (1) preparation of data collection instrument, (2)       data collection and (3) data entry, validation and cleaning. User acceptance was       also evaluated in the two groups of participants: (1) data collectors and (2)      survey participants. RESULTS: None of the errors presented in 20.8% of the paper       questionnaires was found in the data set collected using PDA. Sixty-two percent      of the participants perceived that the PDA-based questionnaire took less time to       complete. Data entry, validation and cleaning for the PDA-based data collection      from 120 participants took a total of 1.5h, a 93.26% reduction of time from 20.5h      required using paper and pen. The cost is also significantly reduced with      PDA-based protocol. Both data collectors and participants prefer to use PDA      instead of paper for data collection. The trial results prove that eSTEPS is a      feasible solution for public health surveillance data collection in the field.      Several deficiencies of the software were also identified and would be addressed       in the next version. CONCLUSION: eSTEPS offers the potential to meet the need for     an effective mobile public health data collection tool for use in the field. The       eSTEPS field trial proves that PDA was more efficient than paper for public      health survey data collection. It also significantly reduced errors in data      entry. The later benefit was derived from the software providing its users with      the flexibility of building their own constraints to control the data type, range      and logic of data entry.

PMID- 19362879   - BACKGROUND: With the introduction of the electronic health record,      physiotherapists too are encouraged to store their patient records in a      structured digital format. The typical nature of a physiotherapy treatment      requires a specific record structure to be implemented, with special attention to      user-friendliness and communication with other healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE:      The objective of this study was to establish a framework for the electronic      physiotherapy record and to define a model for the interoperability with the      other healthcare providers involved in the patients' care. Although we started      from the Belgian context, we used a generic approach so that the results can      easily be extrapolated to other countries. The framework we establish here      defines not only the different building blocks of the electronic physiotherapy      record, but also describes the structure and the content of the exchanged data      elements. METHODS: Through a combined effort by all involved parties, we      elaborated an eight-level structure for the electronic physiotherapy record.      Furthermore we designed a server-based model for the exchange of data between      electronic record systems held by physicians and those held by physiotherapists.       Two newly defined XML messages enable data interchange: the physiotherapy      prescription and the physiotherapy report. RESULTS: We succeeded in defining a      solid, structural model for electronic physiotherapist record systems. Recent      wide scale implementation of operational elements such as the electronic registry      has proven to make the administrative work easier for the physiotherapist.      Moreover, within the proposed framework all the necessary building blocks are      present for further data exchange and communication with other healthcare parties      in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Although we completed the design of the structure and      already implemented some new aspects of the electronic physiotherapy record, the       real challenge lies in persuading the end-users to start using these electronic      record systems. Via a quality label certification procedure, based on adequate      criteria, the Ministry of Health tries to promote the use of electronic      physiotherapy records. We must keep in mind that physiotherapists will show an      interest in electronic record keeping, only if this will lead to a positive      return for them.

PMID- 19359214   - PURPOSE: This paper introduces the modelling of a prototype neonatology      electronic patient record (EPR) using openEHR archetypes. The EPR is necessary to      support the complex communication tasks of the innovative concept of      'Developmental, Family-Centred, Individual Care of Premature Infants and      Newborns' established for the Department of Neonatology at Heidelberg University       Hospital. METHODS: The data to be documented was analysed and modelled using the       five step openEHR data modelling approach (odma). RESULTS: The analysis revealed       a total of 1818 items, which could be arranged into 70 clinical concepts. The      items and concepts were then mapped to 132 openEHR archetypes. Fifty-eight of      these archetypes could be reused either directly or via specialisation from the      existing openEHR archetypes. A further 67 archetypes were newly developed. To      combine and constrain archetypes for local settings 16 templates were developed.       CONCLUSION: By using the five step openEHR data modelling approach, semantic      interoperability, and a reduced need for repeated documentation of the same data       can be realised. This is of major importance within the hospital as well as for     trans-institutional data exchange.

PMID- 19345640   - BACKGROUND: This study assessed current perspectives and expectations for     telemedicine by nursing home caregivers and families of nursing home patients in       Taipei, Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 116 interviews were conducted with family      members (n=37) and caregivers (n=79) using an original, four-part questionnaire      devised to assess the expectations and concerns related to prospective      telemedicine opportunities, including consumer attitude, knowledge of and      interest in medicine, concerns and worries about telemedicine, and anticipated      benefits of telemedicine. RESULTS: Statistical significance between the two      groups was observed in sex, age, and educational level (all p<0.001). Most      respondents had heard about telemedicine before participation and showed some      interest in telemedicine implementation. More than 70.0% of subjects in both      groups had perceptions of telemonitoring of patients, notifications of health      abnormalities, teleconferencing between physicians and family members, obtaining       test/exam results and face-to-face consultation through telenetworks. Both groups      hoped for information and education through telemedicine. More caregivers were      concerned about increased costs (p=0.020), poor hardware quality (p<0.001), poor       security, confidentiality, and reliability (p=0.036), inconvenience to patients      (p=0.006), associated moral and ethical issues (p=0.006), and uncertainty about      responsibility (p=0.022). The two groups did not differ in expectations      concerning benefits of telemedicine. More than 60% of family members or     caregivers expected improved efficiency and quality of hospital and nursing home       health care, greater rapport between nursing homes and either staff or patients,       reduced overall medical costs of caregiving, and reduced staff/caregiver working       hours. The acceptable cost was anything up to $15.30 USD per month. CONCLUSIONS:       Nursing home caregivers and families of nursing home patients are highly      interested in telemedicine; however, they are only willing to pay a slightly      higher cost of nursing care for this service. The challenge for the future in      this industry is to balance peoples' demands and telemedicine's associated costs.      Results of this study suggest that caregivers and families of nursing home      residents favour telemedicine implementation to provide enhanced care      coordination in nursing homes when economic circumstances are favourable.

PMID- 19345609   - PURPOSE: To build and evaluate a national network able to improve the care of      thalassemia, a genetic disorder in haemoglobin synthesis often associated with      iron accumulation in a variety of organs, due to the continuous blood      transfusions. METHODS: The MIOT (Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia) network      is constituted by thalassemia and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) centers.      Thalassemia centers are responsible for patient recruitment and collection of      anamnestic and clinical data. MRI centers have been equipped with a standardized       acquisition technique and an affordable workstation for image analysis. They are       able to perform feasible and reproducible heart and liver iron overload      assessments for a consistent number of thalassemia patients in a robust manner.      All centers are linked by a web-based network, configured to collect and share      patient data. RESULTS: On 30th March 2008, 695 thalassemia patients were involved      in the network. The completion percentage of the patient records in the database       was 85+/-6.5%. Six hundred and thirteen patients (88%) successfully underwent MRI      examination. Each MRI center had a specific absorption capacity that remained      constant over time, but the network was capable of sustaining an increasing      number of patients due to continuous enrollment of new centers. The patient's      comfort, assessed as the mean distance from the patient home locations to the MRI      centers, significantly increased during the network's evolution. CONCLUSION: The       MIOT network seems to be a robust and scalable system in which T2* MRI-based      cardiac and liver iron overload assessment is available, accessible and reachable      for a significant and increasing number of thalassemia patients in Italy (about      420 per year), reducing the mean distance from the patient locations to the MRI      sites from 951km to 387km. A solid, wide and homogeneous database will constitute      an important scientific resource, shortening the time scale for diagnostic,      prognostic and therapeutical evidence-based research on the management of      thalassemia disease.

PMID- 19345608   - PURPOSE: The present study was performed to determine the standard functions of      electronic clinical pathways (eCP) embedded in electronic medical records with      regard to demand definition. METHODS: The standard functions of eCP were decided       by the required functions determined from interviews with hospital staff, those      derived from the implementation of paper-based clinical pathways (CPs), and      additional functions generated through the shift from a paper-based to an      electronic system. Moreover, the proposed standard functions and those of eCP      embedded in electronic medical records for large hospitals were compared by      interviews with five vendors. RESULTS: Seventeen functions were deemed necessary       for eCP, and these were classified into six categories: displaying, recording,      ordering, editing, variance, and statistics. Although most of these functions are      already included in eCP products, their implementations differ between products.       CONCLUSIONS: We propose 17 standard functions required for eCP embedded in      electronic medical records. The functions for editing patient checklists,      checking the occurrence of variance, and statistics are especially important and       should be implemented as standard functions. This study will aid in the future      development of eCP embedded in electronic medical records.

PMID- 19328739   - PURPOSE: Clinical practice guidelines are important instruments for improving the      quality of care; in paper form, however, they are not used as effectively as      possible. In order to develop a guideline-based decision support system (DSS)      prototype to help clinicians deal with diabetic patients' foot problems, we drew       on methodologies from qualitative research, cognitive science, and information      systems. This multi-perspective approach was intended to facilitate user-centered      design and evaluation. METHODS: We employed field observations, structured      interviews, and document analyses to collect and analyze users' workflow      patterns, decision support goals, and preferences regarding interactions with a      DSS. Next, we aligned their requirements with sequence diagrams and followed      Nielsen's heuristics to develop a DSS prototype. We then performed think-aloud      analyses and used the technology acceptance model to direct our evaluation of      users' perceptions of the prototype. RESULTS: Users had a positive response to      the DSS prototype in terms of its clarity of design and ease of use. They      expressed a high intention of using the system in the future. CONCLUSION:      Applying multi-perspective methodologies is an effective way to study and design       user interactions with the front end of a guideline-based DSS.

PMID- 19328036   - MOTIVATION: Topic segmentation and labeling systems enable fine-grained      information search. However, previously proposed methods require annotated data      to adapt to different information needs and have limited applicability to texts      with short segment length. METHODS: We introduce an unsupervised method based on       a combination of hidden Markov models and latent semantic analysis which allows      the topics of interest to be defined freely, without the need for data      annotation, and can identify short segments. RESULTS: The method is evaluated on       intensive care nursing narratives and motivated by information needs in this      domain. The method is shown to considerably outperform a keyword-based heuristic       baseline and to achieve a level of performance comparable to that of a related      supervised method trained on 3600 manually annotated words.

PMID- 19321384   - PURPOSE: Little has been published about the application profiles and development      patterns of open source software (OSS) in health and medical informatics. This      study explores these issues with an analysis of health and medical informatics      related OSS projects on SourceForge, a large repository of open source projects.       METHODOLOGY: A search was conducted on the SourceForge website during the period       from May 1 to 15, 2007, to identify health and medical informatics OSS projects.       This search resulted in a sample of 174 projects. A Java-based parser was written      to extract data for several of the key variables of each project. Several      visually descriptive statistics were generated to analyze the profiles of the OSS      projects. RESULTS: Many of the projects have sponsors, implying a growing      interest in OSS among organizations. Sponsorship, we discovered, has a      significant impact on project success metrics. Nearly two-thirds of the projects       have a restrictive license type. Restrictive licensing may indicate tighter     control over the development process. Our sample includes a wide range of      projects that are at various stages of development (status). Projects targeted      towards the advanced end user are primarily focused on bio-informatics, data      formats, database and medical science applications. CONCLUSION: We conclude that       there exists an active and thriving OSS development community that is focusing on      health and medical informatics. A wide range of OSS applications are in      development, from bio-informatics to hospital information systems. A profile of      OSS in health and medical informatics emerges that is distinct and unique to the       health care field. Future research can focus on OSS acceptance and diffusion and       impact on cost, efficiency and quality of health care.

PMID- 19307149   - PURPOSE: A large share of the information in electronic medical records (EMRs)      consists of free-text compositions. From a computational point-of-view, the      continuing prevalence of free-text entry is a major hindrance when the goal is to      increase automation in EMRs. However, the efforts in developing standards for the      structured representation of medical information have not proven to be a panacea.      The information space of clinical medicine is very diverse and constantly      evolving, making it challenging to develop standards for the domain. This paper     reports a study aiming to increase automation in the EMR through the      computational understanding of specific class of medical text in English, namely       emergency department chief complaints. METHODS: We apply domain-specific      analytical modeling for the computational understanding of chief complaints. We      evaluate the performance of this approach in the automatic classification of      chief complaints, e.g., for use in automatic syndromic surveillance. RESULTS: The      evaluation in a multi-hospital setting showed that the presented algorithm was      accurate in terms of classification correctness. Also, use of approximate      matching in the algorithm to cope with typographic variance did not affect      classification correctness while increasing classification completeness.

PMID- 19307148   - PURPOSE: The alignment of information systems with organizational objectives and       strategies is a key, contemporary challenge to organizations in general and the      health care industry in particular. Researchers and managers alike believe that      the selection of new information systems to support objectives and strategies      focuses the organization on accomplishing its objectives and realizing the value       of the investments in the systems. The purpose of this study was to help      understand alignment in health care so that health care information systems      planners can better achieve it. METHODS: Structured interviews with 15 top      information systems managers in health care organizations of various sizes and      types inquired about organizational objectives and strategies, the process for     choosing new information systems to support those objectives and strategies, and       the concomitant facilitating and hindering managerial actions and organizational       characteristics. RESULTS: In addition to identifying and elucidating specific      objectives, strategies, processes for choosing new systems, and facilitating and       hindering actions and characteristics, the study used the data to characterize a       generalized process of alignment in health care organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The      study contributes by confirming that alignment is a significant issue in health      care organizations, and that such organizations make deliberate efforts to      achieve it. The study further contributes by providing tables of actions and      characteristics that managers might use as checklists in current and future      alignment efforts as well as in generally cultivating broad support for     alignment. Finally, it contributes by suggesting future study of alignment's      predictors and effects in health care organizations.

PMID- 19299195   - INTRODUCTION: In this paper, we present steps taken towards more efficient      automated processing of clinical Finnish, focusing on daily nursing notes in a      Finnish Intensive Care Unit (ICU). First, we analyze ICU Finnish as a      sublanguage, identifying its specific features facilitating, for example, the      development of a specialized syntactic analyser. The identified features include       frequent omission of finite verbs, limitations in allowed syntactic structures,      and domain-specific vocabulary. Second, we develop a formal grammar and a parser       for ICU Finnish, thus providing better tools for the development of further     applications in the clinical domain. METHODS: The grammar is implemented in the      LKB system in a typed feature structure formalism. The lexicon is automatically      generated based on the output of the FinTWOL morphological analyzer adapted to      the clinical domain. As an additional experiment, we study the effect of using      Finnish constraint grammar to reduce the size of the lexicon. The parser     construction thus makes efficient use of existing resources for Finnish. RESULTS:      The grammar currently covers 76.6% of ICU Finnish sentences, producing highly      accurate best-parse analyzes with F-score of 91.1%. We find that building a      parser for the highly specialized domain sublanguage is not only feasible, but      also surprisingly efficient, given an existing morphological analyzer with broad       vocabulary coverage. The resulting parser enables a deeper analysis of the text      than was previously possible.

PMID- 19297243   - PURPOSE: Although public health informatics (PHI) was defined in 1995, both then       and still now it is an "emerging" profession. An emergent profession lacks a base      of "technical specialized knowledge." Therefore, we analyzed MEDLINE      bibliographic citation records of the PHI literature to determine if a base of      technical, specialized PHI literature exists, which could lead to the conclusion       that PHI has emerged from its embryonic state. METHOD: A MEDLINE search for PHI      literature published from 1980-2006 returned 16,942 records. Record screening by       two subject matter experts netted 2493 PHI records that were analyzed by the      intervals of previous PHI CBMs 96-4 and 2001-2 for 1980-1995 (I(1980)) and      1996-2000 (I(1996)), respectively, and a new, third interval of 2001-2006      (I(2001)). RESULTS: The distribution of records was 676 (I(1980)), 839 (I(1996))       and 978 (I(2001)). Annual publication rates were 42 (I(1980)), 168 (I(1996)), and      163 (I(2001)). Cumulative publications were accelerating. A subset of 19 (2.5%)      journals accounted for 730 (29.3%) of the records. The journal subset average      (+/-SD) annual publication rates of 0.7+/-0.6 (I(1980)), 2.9+/-1.9 (I(1996)), and      3.1+/-2.7 (I(2001)) were different, F(3, 64)=7.12, p<.05. Only I(1980) was      different (p<.05) from I(1996) or I(2001). Average (+/-SE) annual rate of      increase for all journals (8.4+/-0.8 publications per year) was different from      the subset of 19 (2.7+/-0.3), t(36)=5.74, p<.05. MeSH first time-to-indexing      narrowed from 7.3 (+/-4.3) years to the year (0.5+/-0.8) the term was introduced,      t(30)=7.03, p<.05. CONCLUSION: A core set of journals, the proliferation of PHI      articles in varied and numerous journals, and rapid uptake of MeSH suggest PHI is      acquiring professional authority and now should not be tagged as an "emerging"      profession.

PMID- 19261544   - PURPOSE: The introduction of a Critical Care Information System (CCIS) into an      intensive care unit (ICU) is purported to reduce the time health care providers      (HCP) spend on documentation and increase the time available for direct patient      care. However, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research that has      investigated these assertions. Moreover, those studies that have sought to      elucidate the relationship between the introduction of a CCIS and the time spent       by staff on in/direct patient care activities have published contradictory      findings. The objective of this literature review is to establish the impact of a      CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU.      METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched including PubMed Central,      EMBASE, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.      Reference lists of all published papers were hand searched, and citations      reviewed to identify extra papers. We included studies that were empirical      articles, published in English, and provided original data on the impact of a      CCIS on time spent documenting and in direct patient care by staff in the ICU.      RESULTS: In total, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. Workflow analysis      (66%) and time-and-motion analysis (25%) were the most common forms of data      collection. Three (25%) studies found an increase in time spent charting, five      (42%) found no difference, and four (33%) studies reported a decrease. Results on      the impact of a CCIS on direct patient care were similarly inconclusive.      CONCLUSIONS: Due to the discrepant findings and several key methodological      issues, the impact of a CCIS on time spent charting and in direct patient care      remains unclear. This review highlights the need for an increase in rigorous      empirical research in this area and provides recommendations for the design and      implementation of future studies.

PMID- 19249240   - The SHARE(1) project (http://www.eu-share.org) was asked to identify the key      developments needed to achieve wide adoption and deployment of HealthGrids      throughout Europe. The project was asked to organise these as milestones on a      road map, so that all technical advances, social actions, economic investments      and ethical or legal initiatives necessary for HealthGrids would be seen together     in a single coherent document. The full road map includes an extensive analysis      of several case studies exploring their technical requirements, full discussion      of the ethical, legal, social and economic issues which may impede early      deployment, and concludes with an attempt to reconcile the tensions between      technological developments and regulatory frameworks. This paper has been      restricted to the technical aspects of the project. SHARE built on the work of      the 'HealthGrid' initiative so we begin by, reviewing work carried out in various      European HealthGrid projects and report on joint work with numerous European      collaborators. Following many successful HealthGrid projects, HealthGrid      published a 'White Paper' which establishes the foundations, potential scope and       prospects of an approach to health informatics based on a grid infrastructure.      The White Paper demonstrates the ways in which the HealthGrid approach supports      many modern trends in medicine and healthcare, such as evidence-based practice,      integration across levels, from molecules and cells, through tissues and organs      to the whole person and community, and the promise of individualised healthcare.       SHARE was funded by the European Commission to define a research roadmap for a      'HealthGrid for Europe', to be seen as the preferred infrastructure for     biomedical and healthcare projects in the European Research Area.

PMID- 19230751   - PURPOSE: To compare the results of drug safety data mining with three different      algorithms, when adverse events are identified using MedDRA Preferred Terms (PT)       vs. High Level Terms (HLT) vs. Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ). METHODS: For a       representative set of 26 drugs, data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System       (AERS) database from 2001 through 2005 was mined for signals of disproportionate       reporting (SDRs) using three different data mining algorithms (DMAs): the Gamma      Poisson Shrinker (GPS), the urn-model algorithm (URN), and the proportional      reporting rate (PRR) algorithm. Results were evaluated using a previously      described Reference Event Database (RED) which contains documented drug-event      associations for the 26 drugs. Analysis emphasized the percentage of SDRs in the       "unlabeled supported" category, corresponding to those adverse events that were      not described in the U.S. prescribing information for the drug at the time of its      approval, but which were supported by some published evidence for an association       with the drug. RESULTS: Based on a logistic regression analysis, the percentage      of unlabeled supported SDRs was smallest at the PT level, intermediate at the HLT      level, and largest at the SMQ level, for all three algorithms. The GPS and URN      methods detected comparable percentages of unlabeled supported SDRs while the PRR     method detected a smaller percentage, at all three MedDRA levels. No evidence of       a method/level interaction was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HLT and SMQ groupings      can improve the percentage of unlabeled supported SDRs in data mining results.      The trade-off for this gain is the medically less-specific language of HLTs and      SMQs compared to PTs, and the need for the added step in data mining of examining      the component PTs of each HLT or SMQ that results in a signal of disproportionate      reporting.

PMID- 19196548   - BACKGROUND: One of the most important factors for the success of health      information technology (IT) implementation is users' acceptance and use of that      technology. Thailand has implemented the national universal healthcare program      and has been restructuring the country's health IT system to support it. However,      there is no national data available regarding the acceptance and use of health IT      in many healthcare facilities, including community health centers (CHCs). This      study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology      (UTAUT) structural model, to understand factors that influence health IT adoption      in community health centers in Thailand and to validate this extant IT adoption      model in a developing country health care context. METHODS: An observational      research design was employed to study CHCs' IT adoption and use. A random sample       of 1607 regionally stratified CHC's from a total of 9806 CHCs was selected. Data       collection was conducted using a cross-sectional survey by means of      self-administered questionnaire with an 82% response rate. The research model was      applied using the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling. RESULTS: The data      showed that people who worked in CHCs exhibited a high degree of IT acceptance      and use. The research model analyses suggest that IT acceptance is influenced by       performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and voluntariness.      Health IT use is predicted by previous IT experiences, intention to use the      system, and facilitating conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Health IT is pervasive and well      adopted by CHCs in Thailand. The study results have implications for both health       IT developmental efforts in Thailand and health informatics research. This study       validated the UTAUT model in the field context of a developing country's      healthcare system and demonstrated that the PLS path modeling works well in a      field study and in exploratory research with a complex model.

PMID- 19195926   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the spatial and temporal      information generated from two distinct health data sources available for the      surveillance of intestinal infections associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7.      METHODS: Our study area is the province of Alberta, Canada. Data are from two      sources: a fee-for-service administrative health data system and a notifiable      disease data reporting system. The study period is between 1999 and 2005. We      compare the systems by observing correlations in the infections over time, the      variability in the overall distribution of cases (as measured by a geographic      dissimilarity index), and the relative locations of spatial-temporal clusters of       infection. RESULTS: Our results indicate considerable variability in information       generated from these two systems. The geographic distribution of cases varies      considerably, with annual indices of dissimilarity suggesting considerable      variation in the geographic distribution of cases throughout the study period      (D=0.445). The temporal patterns identified by these two sources of information      are negatively correlated (-0.40, p<0.001). Notifiable disease clusters occur in       the summer in southern regions of the province, whereas cases identified from      administrative health data system cluster in the winter season, and further to      the north. CONCLUSIONS: Notifiable disease data may suffer from selection bias;      administrative health data may be insufficiently precise without laboratory      confirmation. Our results illustrate differences in the spatial and temporal      information generated from these two systems of case identification. Future      surveillance of gastrointestinal illness of infectious origin may benefit from      case ascertainment algorithms based on both sources of data.

PMID- 19174325   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and       a formal analysis of the scientific quality of empirical research on computerized      provider order-entry (CPOE) applications. DESIGN: Formal, systematic review      techniques were used to search the literature, determine study relevance, and      evaluate study quality. MEASUREMENT: A search of multiple databases from 1976      through mid-2007 yielded a final set of 46 articles. Relevance criteria included:      (1) a direct comparison of a CPOE system with a non-CPOE system; (2)      implementation in a clinical setting; and (3) clinically relevant outcomes.      RESULTS: Study quality varied widely. Three major areas were identified for     improvement in future studies: (1) internal validity, especially in terms of      study designs, blinding, and instrumentation bias; (2) construct validity of the       phenomenon of CPOE itself; and (3) measurement strategies, including reliability       and validity assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the impact of CPOE needs       to be improved to support scientific generalizability. Several common confounds      are found in this literature. Future researchers will want to address them to      improve the strength of the inference between CPOE and clinical outcomes.      Discussion focuses on methods to improve future CPOE research.

PMID- 19167271   - OBJECTIVES: In Taiwan, campus health problems are placing more and more pressure       on school-based health centers (SBHCs). Moreover, SBHCs have insufficient      resources to actively provide follow-up healthcare for students and faculty found      to be overweight, chronically ill, or at high risk. In order to improve the      quality of SBHC healthcare, a project was begun to enhance the efficiency of      campus healthcare services by employing web-based and cell phone-based services.       This project employed the Mobile Automated Medical Alert (MAMA) system, which was      designed especially for campus health center use. Before implementing the MAMA      system, a focus group of healthcare related staff identified areas in which SBHC       healthcare services might be improved by the system and created a questionnaire      to measure student and faculty response to the proposed services. Modifications      to the MAMA design and service offerings were made based upon these questionnaire      results. METHOD: After the initial brainstorming session, the MAMA team created a      survey instrument that was administered to students and faculty in order to      understand their attitudes toward the proposed mobile healthcare services. Two      hundred questionnaires were distributed to students and faculty at a private      technical college in central Taiwan. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 100% had      cellular phones and used short-text messages. Ninety-five percent of the student       respondents and 85% of the faculty respondents agreed that mobile healthcare      system would improve the quality of the health care their SBHC was currently      providing. Based on these positive survey responses, the MAMA system was      implemented. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The current paper describes the process by      which the MAMA team brainstormed proposed services and administered their survey.      Survey results and the consequent changes to the MAMA system are discussed.      Finally, recommendations are made for MAMA system use and a description is      offered of the impact such systems might have on the future of college campus      healthcare services.

PMID- 19162538   - PURPOSE: Advanced information technologies joined to the increasing use of      continuous medical devices for monitoring and treatment, have made possible the      definition of a new telemedical diabetes care scenario based on a hand-held      Personal Assistant (PA). This paper describes the architecture, functionality and      implementation of the PA, which communicates different medical devices in a      personal wireless network. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The PA is a mobile system      for patients with diabetes connected to a telemedical center. The software design      follows a modular approach to make the integration of medical devices or new      functionalities independent from the rest of its components. Physicians can      remotely control medical devices from the telemedicine server through the      integration of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and mobile      GPRS communications. Data about PA modules' usage and patients' behavior     evaluation come from a pervasive tracing system implemented into the PA. RESULTS       AND DISCUSSION: The PA architecture has been technically validated with      commercially available medical devices during a clinical experiment for     ambulatory monitoring and expert feedback through telemedicine. The clinical      experiment has allowed defining patients' patterns of usage and preferred      scenarios and it has proved the Personal Assistant's feasibility. The patients      showed high acceptability and interest in the system as recorded in the usability      and utility questionnaires. Future work will be devoted to the validation of the       system with automatic control strategies from the telemedical center as well as      with closed-loop control algorithms.

PMID- 19157969   - OBJECTIVE: To discuss, taking the example of a meta-analysis on computerized      physician order entry (CPOE) systems, the special challenges of Evidence-Based      Health Informatics, defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of      current best evidence when making decisions about introduction and operation of      information technology in a given health care setting. METHODS: We conducted a      case study by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of CPOE studies.      We collected and discussed the challenges we addressed and how they could be      overcome. RESULTS: Challenges comprise the correct identification of published      health informatics evaluation studies, the low reporting and study quality of      studies, the problem of combining evidence from heterogeneous studies, and the      problem of publication bias in health informatics. CONCLUSION: Based on our     experiences while conducting the CPOE meta-analysis, we argue that we are still      at the beginning of Evidence-Based Health Informatics. To overcome the discussed       challenges, health informatics should strive for harmonized terminology, a study       registry, reporting standards, financial or legal incentives for conducting      studies, methods to combine evidence from quantitative and qualitative studies,      and guidelines for conducting and publishing evaluation studies.

PMID- 19157968   - OBJECTIVE: OpenMRS (www.openmrs.org) is a configurable open source electronic      medical record application developed and maintained by a large network of open      source developers coordinated by the Regenstrief Institute and Partners in Health      and mainly used for HIV patient and treatment information management in Africa.      Our objective is to develop an open Implementers Network for OpenMRS to provide      regional support for the growing number of OpenMRS implementations in Africa and       to include African developers and implementers in the future growth of OpenMRS.      METHODS: We have developed the OpenMRS Implementers Network using a dedicated      Wiki site and e-mail server. We have also organized annual meetings in South      Africa and regional training courses at African locations where OpenMRS is being       implemented. An OpenMRS Internship program has been initiated and we have started      collaborating with similar networks and projects working in Africa. To evaluate      its potential, OpenMRS was implemented initially at one site in South Africa by a      single implementer using a downloadable OpenMRS application and only the OpenMRS       Implementers Network for support. RESULTS: The OpenMRS Implementers Network Wiki       and list server have grown into effective means of providing implementation      support and forums for exchange of implementation experiences. The annual OpenMRS      Implementers meeting has been held in South Africa for the past three years and      is attracting successively larger numbers of participants with almost 200      implementers and developers attending the 2008 meeting in Durban, South Africa.      Six African developers are presently registered on the first intake of the      OpenMRS Internship program. Successful collaborations have been started with      several African developer groups and projects initiated to develop      interoperability between OpenMRS and various applications. The South African      OpenMRS Implementer group successfully configured, installed and maintained an      integrated HIV/TB OpenMRS application without significant programming support.      Since then, this model has been replicated in several other African sites. The      OpenMRS Implementers Network has contributed substantially to the growth and      sustainability of OpenMRS in Africa and has become a useful way of including      Africans in the development and implementation of OpenMRS in developing      countries. The Network provides valuable support and enables a basic OpenMRS      application to be implemented in the absence of onsite programmers.

PMID- 19157967   - OBJECTIVE: Handheld computers (personal digital assistant, PDA) have the      potential to reduce the logistic burden, cost, and error rate of paper-based      health research data collection, but there is a lack of appropriate software. The      present work describes the development and evaluation of PDACT, a Personal Data      Collection Toolset (www.healthware.org/pdact/index.htm) for the Palm Pilot      handheld computer for interviewer-administered and respondent-administered data      collection. METHODS: We developed Personal Data Collection Toolkit (PDACT)      software to enable questionnaires developed in QDS Design Studio, a Windows      application, to be compiled and completed on Palm Pilot devices and evaluated in       several representative field survey settings. RESULTS: The software has been used      in seven separate studies and in over 90,000 interviews. Five      interviewer-administered studies were completed in rural settings with poor     communications infrastructure, following one day of interviewer training. Two      respondent-administered questionnaire studies were completed by learners, in      urban secondary schools, after 15min training. Questionnaires were available on      each handheld in up to 11 languages, ranged from 20 to 580 questions, and took      between 15 and 90min to complete. Up to 200 Palm Pilot devices were in use on a      single day and, in about 50 device-years of use, very few technical problems were      found. Compared with paper-based collection, data validation and cleaning times      were reduced, and fewer errors were found. PDA data collection is easy to use and      preferred by interviewers and respondents (both respondent-administered and      interviewer-administered) over paper. Data are compiled and available within      hours of collection facilitating data quality assurance. Although hardware      increases the setup cost of the first study, the cumulative cost falls      thereafter, and converges on the cumulative cost of paper-based studies (four, in      the case of our interviewer-administered studies). Handheld data collection is an      appropriate, affordable and convenient technology for health data collection, in       diverse settings.

PMID- 19157966   - CCOW standards have been touted to currently be the best way to integrate      disparate clinical applications by passing user identification and passwords as      well as patient context between these applications at the desktop. However,      nothing has been published in academic journals on the actual realities of      implementation of CCOW. In this report, we describe the implementation of CCOW      for our three main clinical applications and compare this with the simultaneous      development and implementation of a portal session manager for the same purpose.       We found the portal session manager much easier to develop and implement than      CCOW. The resulting functionality was almost equivalent as judged by our clinical      end users who compared both solutions. We now have the portal session manager     functional across the institution and have stopped any further work on CCOW.

PMID- 19131270   - OBJECTIVE: To develop and characterize a large, representative sample of      guideline recommendations that can be used to better understand how current      recommendations are written and to test the adequacy of guideline models. We      refer to this sample as the Yale Guideline Recommendation Corpus (YGRC). METHOD:       To develop the YGRC, we extracted recommendations from guidelines downloaded from      the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC). We evaluated the representativeness      of the YGRC by comparing the frequency of use of controlled vocabulary terms in      the YGRC sample and in the NGC. We examined semantic and formatting indicators      that were used to denote recommendation statements. RESULTS: In the course of      reviewing 7527 recommendation statements, we extracted 1275 recommendations from       the NGC and characterized the guidelines from which they were derived. Both      semantic and formatting indicators were used inconsistently to denote      recommendations. Recommendation statements were not reliably identifiable in      31.6% (310/982) of the guidelines and many recommendations were not executable as      written. We also found variability and inconsistency in the way strength of      recommendation is currently reported. Over half of the recommendations (52.7%),      did not indicate strength, while 6.5% inaccurately indicated strength.      CONCLUSION: The YGRC provides a representative sample of current guideline      recommendations and demonstrates considerable variability and inconsistency in      the way recommendations are written and in the way the recommendation strength is      currently reported.

PMID- 19117798   - CONTENT AND OBJECTIVE: Health professionals now routinely use electronic      knowledge resources (EKRs). Few studies have considered EKR-related tensions      which may arise in a clinical decision-making context. The present study aims to       explore three types of tension: (1) user-computer tension, (2) social tensions,      and (3) organizational tensions (constraints associated with organizational      routines and health policies). DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTION, SETTING: We      conducted a multiple case study, examining Family Medicine residents' searches      for information in everyday life. Cases were defined as critical searches for     information among 17 first year family medicine residents using InfoRetriever     2003/2004 on a PDA over 1.5 months at McGill University. InfoRetriever-derived      information was used within a resident-patient decision-making context in 84 of      156 cases. For each case, residents were interviewed, and extracts of interview      transcripts were assigned to themes using specialized software (presence of      tension; type of tension). Further computer-assisted lexical-semantic analysis      was performed on transcripts. Authors reached consensus on assignments. RESULTS:       Twenty-five cases with tension were identified (one case had two types of      tension), and illustrate the above mentioned types of tensions: (T1) tension      between the resident and InfoRetriever (N=16); (T2) InfoRetriever-related tension      between the resident and other social actors, specifically supervisors, other     health care professionals and patients (N=7); (T3) InfoRetriever-related tension       between the resident and the health organization/system (N=3). CONCLUSIONS:      Results suggest EKR usage in a clinical decision-making context may have negative      consequences when three types of tension arise in a clinical decision-making      context. Illustrated types of tension are interrelated and not mutually      exclusive. Awareness of EKR-related tensions may help clinicians to integrate      EKRs in practice.

PMID- 19101197   - This paper discusses some crucial issues associated with the exploitation of data      and information about health care for the improvement of patient safety. In      particular, the issues of human factors and safety management are analysed in      relation to exploitation of reports about non-conformity events and field      observations. A methodology for integrating field observation and theoretical      approaches for safety studies is described. Two sample cases are discussed in      detail: the first one makes reference to the use of data collected in the      aviation domain and shows how these can be utilised to define hazard and risk;      the second one concerns a typical ethnographic study in a large hospital      structure for the identification of most relevant areas of intervention. The      results show that, if national authorities find a way to harmonise and formalize       critical aspects, such as the severity of standard events, it is possible to      estimate risk and define auditing needs, well before the occurrence of serious      incidents, and to indicate practical ways forward for improving safety standards.

PMID- 19095496   - CONTEXT: Medication error prevention is a priority for the U.S. healthcare system      in the 21st century. Use of technology is considered by some as critical to      achieve this goal. Knowledge of the attitudinal barriers to such adoption,      however, is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes of frontline      prescriber clinicians towards technology in general, and PDAs specifically,      before and after introduction of a PDA in the clinical setting of medication      prescribing. DESIGN: A pre- and post-intervention web-based survey, 12-14 months       apart. SETTING: Academic tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Total      of 244 prescriber clinicians. INTERVENTION: Distribution of a PDA with      pediatric-specific medication prescribing information after completion of an      on-line medication safety certification and other safety focused educational      sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ratings (5-point Likert scale) reflecting      perceptions and attitudes towards technology in general and technology in medical      settings along with self-reported usage of the PDA for Rx. RESULTS: Early      Adopters and Late Adopters were identified statistically, and the group      membership reflected their prior exposure to and ownership of other technologies.      Early Adopters tended to be younger and less experienced clinically (e.g.,      residents) and more frequent owners and users of technology. Early Adopters      expressed significantly more favorable attitudes toward technology and PDAs on      both pre- to post-intervention survey occasions. They also utilized the PDA for     Rx more often than LAs. Interestingly, PDA use for Early Adopters was based on      its ease of use, while PDA use among later adopters was based on its clinical      usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of point of care information using PDAs and a       user-friendly, pediatric-specific medication information software package did not      positively affect the attitudes of prescriber clinicians among those already      favorable toward technology. However, a significant change was found among those       with initially less favorable attitudes. Organizations need to understand the      nature of both Early and Late Adopters and plan appropriately for managing the      respective needs and expectations when potentially beneficial technologies are      introduced. In order to ensure the success of an implementation, the training and      supportive interventions need to be carefully designed and specifically catered      to the personality-based outcome expectations of the prescriber.

PMID- 19081295   - BACKGROUND: Researchers in healthcare have begun to investigate interruptions      extensively, given evidence for the adverse effects of work interruptions in      other domains and given the highly interruptive hospital environment. In this      paper, we reviewed literature on interruptions in critical care and medication      dispensing settings in search of evidence for a relationship between      interruptions and adverse events. METHODS: The literature search included the      databases MEDLINE, CINAHL+Pre CINHAL, Health Sources: Nursing Academic Edition,      EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science and Ergonomics Abstracts. The paper titles      and abstracts were subsequently reviewed. After the initial search, we reviewed      paper titles and abstracts to define the subset for review. RESULTS: We currently      lack evidence in healthcare of the extent to which interruptions lead to adverse       effects. The lack of evidence may be due to the descriptive rather than causal      nature of most studies, the lack of theory motivating investigations of the      relationship, the fact that healthcare is a complex and varied domain, and      inadequate conceptualizations of accident aetiology. We identify two recent      accident theories in which the relationship between activity and medical errors      is complex, indicating that even when it is sought, causal evidence is hard to      find. DISCUSSION: Future research on interruptions in healthcare settings should       focus on the following. First, prospective memory research and distributed      cognition can provide a theoretical background for understanding the impact of      interruptions and so could provide guidance for future empirical research on      interruptions and the planning of actions in healthcare. Second, studying how      interruptions are successfully rather than unsuccessfully overcome may better     help us understand their effects. Third, because interruptions almost always have      positive and adverse effects, more appropriate dependent variables could be      chosen.

PMID- 19046928   - OBJECTIVE: Usability evaluation is now widely recognized as critical to the      success of interactive health care applications. However, the broad range of      usability inspection and testing methods available may make it difficult to      decide on a usability assessment plan. To guide novices in the human-computer     interaction field, we provide an overview of the methodological and empirical      research available on the three usability inspection and testing methods most      often used. METHODS: We describe two 'expert-based' and one 'user-based'      usability method: (1) the heuristic evaluation, (2) the cognitive walkthrough,      and (3) the think aloud. RESULTS: All three usability evaluation methods are      applied in laboratory settings. Heuristic evaluation is a relatively efficient      usability evaluation method with a high benefit-cost ratio, but requires high      skills and usability experience of the evaluators to produce reliable results.      The cognitive walkthrough is a more structured approach than the heuristic      evaluation with a stronger focus on the learnability of a computer application.      Major drawbacks of the cognitive walkthrough are the required level of detail of       task and user background descriptions for an adequate application of the latest      version of the technique. The think aloud is a very direct method to gain deep      insight in the problems end users encounter in interaction with a system but data      analyses is extensive and requires a high level of expertise both in the      cognitive ergonomics and in computer system application domain. DISCUSSION AND      CONCLUSIONS: Each of the three usability evaluation methods has shown its      usefulness, has its own advantages and disadvantages; no single method has      revealed any significant results indicating that it is singularly effective in      all circumstances. A combination of different techniques that compliment one      another should preferably be used as their collective application will be more      powerful than applied in isolation. Innovative mobile and automated solutions to       support end-user testing have emerged making combined approaches of laboratory,      field and remote usability evaluations of new health care applications more      feasible.

PMID- 19010728   - PURPOSE: To identify the main concerns of a broad range of hospital staff about      the implementation of a new Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system for     medication management. METHODS: The study was conducted in a large Australian      teaching hospital using semi-structured interviews (n=20) and focus groups (six      focus groups involving a total of 30 participants) from a broad section of health      professionals including doctors, nurses, managers, pharmacists and senior health       executives. Systematic concurrent analysis of the data was undertaken by a team      of researchers. RESULTS: We identified 20 recurrent themes related to nine areas       of shared concern including work practices, software/hardware,      relationships/communication, education and training, inexperienced staff and      de-skilling. A higher level of analysis identified four interrelated constructs      that highlight what people are concerned about: (1) Will it help? (2) Will it      work? (3) Will we cope? (4) Will it impair existing interaction? LIMITATIONS: The      research provides a snapshot overview of perceptions from a range of hospital      personnel in the lead up to CPOE implementation. Generalizability is limited by      the size of the sample and the contextual circumstances of the hospital being      studied. DISCUSSION: This work contributes valuable evidence about an      often-neglected dimension in the evaluation of computer systems in hospitals,      namely the pre-implementation concerns of staff. These pre-conceptions can have a      significant effect on how technology is implemented and utilised. Acknowledging      and addressing people's concerns can contribute to the establishment of durable      channels of negotiation and communication. Further research informed by the      findings of this study will help advance this process.

PMID- 19008147   - PURPOSE: To examine the medication advice-seeking network of staff in a hospital       ward. METHODS: Social network analysis was carried out in a renal ward of an      Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. The medication advice-seeking      interactions of doctors, nurses, allied health professionals (including a      pharmacist) and a ward clerk were examined using data from questionnaires      administered to staff. The questionnaire listed all staff who worked in the ward       and sought information from respondents regarding their interactions with each      staff member. Data were analysed using social network software, UCINET. Analyses       performed included geodesic distance, network density, strength of ties,      reciprocation of relations, and centrality of individuals. NetDraw was used to      produce social network diagrams. RESULTS: A very high response rate of 96% was      achieved with 45 of 47 staff returning the questionnaire. On average, there is      little interaction between each of the staff members in the medication      advice-seeking network, with even less interaction between staff from different      professional groups. Nurses are mainly located on one side of the network and      doctors on the other. However, the pharmacist is quite central in the medication       advice-seeking network as are some senior nurses and a junior doctor.      CONCLUSIONS: When hospital clinical staff seek medication advice from other     members of a ward it tends to be sought from those in their profession. However     key individuals in the ward are relied upon for the provision of medication      advice by staff from all professions. Social network analysis can be used to      examine the complex medication advice-seeking interactions amongst staff in a      hospital ward, providing useful quantitative baseline data against which to      compare the effect of interventions, such as an electronic medication system, on       interactions.

PMID- 18996737   - PURPOSE: With the increasing use of images in disease research, education, and      clinical medicine, the need for methods that effectively archive, query, and      retrieve these images by their content is underscored. This paper describes the      implementation of a Web-based retrieval system called SPIRS (Spine Pathology &      Image Retrieval System), which permits exploration of a large biomedical database      of digitized spine X-ray images and data from a national health survey using a      combination of visual and textual queries. METHODS: SPIRS is a generalizable      framework that consists of four components: a client applet, a gateway, an      indexing and retrieval system, and a database of images and associated text data.      The prototype system is demonstrated using text and imaging data collected as      part of the second U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES       II). Users search the image data by providing a sketch of the vertebral outline      or selecting an example vertebral image and some relevant text parameters.      Pertinent pathology on the image/sketch can be annotated and weighted to indicate      importance. RESULTS: During the course of development, we explored different      algorithms to perform functions such as segmentation, indexing, and retrieval.      Each algorithm was tested individually and then implemented as part of SPIRS. To       evaluate the overall system, we first tested the system's ability to return      similar vertebral shapes from the database given a query shape. Initial      evaluations using visual queries only (no text) have shown that the system      achieves up to 68% accuracy in finding images in the database that exhibit      similar abnormality type and severity. Relevance feedback mechanisms have been      shown to increase accuracy by an additional 22% after three iterations. While we       primarily demonstrate this system in the context of retrieving vertebral shape,      our framework has also been adapted to search a collection of 100,000 uterine      cervix images to study the progression of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: SPIRS is       automated, easily accessible, and integratable with other complementary      information retrieval systems. The system supports the ability for users to      intuitively query large amounts of imaging data by providing visual examples and       text keywords and has beneficial implications in the areas of research,      education, and patient care.

PMID- 18996736   - BACKGROUND: Previous research studies have focused on the recipients of      interruptions because of the negative impact interruptions have on task      performance. It is equally important to understand the initiators of      interruptions to help design strategies to lessen the number of interruptions and      the possible negatives consequences. The purpose of this study was to examine MDs      and RNs as initiators and recipients of interruptions. METHODS: This was an      instrumental case study using the shadowing method. A convenience sample of five       attending trauma MDs and eight RNs were observed during the 07:00-15:00 and      15:00-21:00 shifts in the trauma section of a level one trauma center. RESULT:      Seventy hours of observations were recorded. Initiator and recipient of an      interruption emerged as major roles during categorization of the notes. Medical      doctors and RNs were found to be the recipient of an interruption more frequently      than the initiator. Findings from this study indicate that MDs and RNs initiate      interruptions most often through face-to-face interactions and use of the      telephone. CONCLUSIONS: A role-based taxonomy of interruptions was derived from      the recorded notes. Strategies to successfully manage interruptions must consider     both the role of initiator as well as the recipient when an interruption occurs.       It is suggested that the role-based taxonomy presented in this paper be used to      classify interruptions in future studies.

PMID- 18951838   - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding how health information technologies influence      clinicians' patterns of work and support efficient practices is limited.      Traditional paper-based data collection methods are unable to capture clinical      work complexity and communication patterns. The use of electronic data collection      tools for such studies is emerging yet is rarely assessed for reliability or     validity. AIM: Our aim was to design, apply and test an observational method      which incorporated the use of an electronic data collection tool for work      measurement studies which would allow efficient, accurate and reliable data      collection, and capture greater degrees of work complexity than current      approaches. METHODS: We developed an observational method and software for     personal digital assistants (PDAs) which captures multiple dimensions of      clinicians' work tasks, namely what task, with whom, and with what; tasks      conducted in parallel (multi-tasking); interruptions and task duration. During      field-testing over 7 months across four hospital wards, fifty-two nurses were      observed for 250 h. Inter-rater reliability was tested and validity was measured       by (i) assessing whether observational data reflected known differences in      clinical role work tasks and (ii) by comparing observational data with      participants' estimates of their task time distribution. RESULTS: Observers took       15-20 h of training to master the method and data collection process. Only 1% of       tasks observed did not match the classification developed and were classified as       'other'. Inter-rater reliability scores of observers were maintained at over 85%.      The results discriminated between the work patterns of enrolled and registered      nurses consistent with differences in their roles. Survey data (n=27) revealed      consistent ratings of tasks by nurses, and their rankings of most to least      time-consuming tasks were significantly correlated with those derived from the      observational data. Over 40% of nurses' time was spent in direct care or     professional communication, with 11.8% of time spent multi-tasking. Nurses were      interrupted approximately every 49 min. One quarter of interruptions occurred      while nurses were preparing or administering medications. CONCLUSIONS: This      method efficiently produces reliable and valid data. The multi-dimensional nature      of the data collected provides greater insights into patterns of clinicians' work      and communication than has previously been possible using other methods.

PMID- 18938105   - OBJECTIVE: Typically detected via electrocardiograms (ECGs), QT interval      prolongation is a known risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Since medications      can promote or exacerbate the condition, detection of QT interval prolongation is      important for clinical decision support. We investigated the accuracy of natural       language processing (NLP) for identifying QT prolongation from      cardiologist-generated, free-text ECG impressions compared to corrected QT (QTc)       thresholds reported by ECG machines. METHODS: After integrating negation      detection to a locally developed natural language processor, the KnowledgeMap      concept identifier, we evaluated NLP-based detection of QT prolongation compared       to the calculated QTc on a set of 44,318 ECGs obtained from hospitalized      patients. We also created a string query using regular expressions to identify QT      prolongation. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of the methods using      manual physician review of the cardiologist-generated reports as the gold      standard. To investigate causes of "false positive" calculated QTc, we manually      reviewed randomly selected ECGs with a long calculated QTc but no mention of QT      prolongation. Separately, we validated the performance of the negation detection       algorithm on 5000 manually categorized ECG phrases for any medical concept (not      limited to QT prolongation) prior to developing the NLP query for QT      prolongation. RESULTS: The NLP query for QT prolongation correctly identified      2364 of 2373 ECGs with QT prolongation with a sensitivity of 0.996 and a positive      predictive value of 1.000. There were no false positives. The regular expression       query had a sensitivity of 0.999 and positive predictive value of 0.982. In      contrast, the positive predictive value of common QTc thresholds derived from ECG      machines was 0.07-0.25 with corresponding sensitivities of 0.994-0.046. The      negation detection algorithm had a recall of 0.973 and precision of 0.982 for     10,490 concepts found within ECG impressions. CONCLUSION: NLP and regular     expression queries of cardiologists' ECG interpretations can more effectively      identify QT prolongation than the automated QTc intervals reported by ECG      machines. Future clinical decision support could employ NLP queries to detect QTc      prolongation and other reported ECG abnormalities.

PMID- 18930696   - OBJECTIVE: Development of guidelines for publication of evaluation studies of      Health Informatics applications. METHODS: An initial list of issues to be      addressed in reports on evaluation studies was drafted based on experiences as      editors and reviewers of journals in Health Informatics and as authors of      systematic reviews of Health Informatics studies, taking into account guidelines       for reporting of medical research. This list has been discussed in several rounds      by an increasing number of experts in Health Informatics evaluation during      conferences and by using e-mail and has been put up for comments on the web.      RESULTS: A set of STARE-HI principles to be addressed in papers describing      evaluations of Health Informatics interventions is presented. These principles      include formulation of title and abstract, of introduction (e.g. scientific      background, study objectives), study context (e.g. organizational setting, system      details), methods (e.g. study design, outcome measures), results (e.g. study      findings, unexpected observations) and discussion and conclusion of an IT      evaluation paper. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive list of principles relevant for     properly describing Health Informatics evaluations has been developed. When      manuscripts submitted to Health Informatics journals and general medical journals      adhere to these aspects, readers will be better positioned to place the studies      in a proper context and judge their validity and generalisability. It will also      be possible to judge better whether papers will fit in the scope of meta-analyses      of Health Informatics interventions. STARE-HI may also be used for study planning      and hence positively influence the quality of evaluation studies in Health      Informatics. We believe that better publication of both quantitative and      qualitative evaluation studies is an important step toward the vision of      evidence-based Health Informatics. LIMITATIONS: This study is based on      experiences from editors, reviewers, authors of systematic reviews and readers of      the scientific literature. The applicability of the principles has not been      evaluated in real practice. Only when authors start to use these principles for     reporting, shortcomings in the principles will emerge.

PMID- 18922738   - In this manuscript we report an evaluation of the reliability of clinical      research rules creation by multiple clinicians using the Health Archetype      Language (HAL-42) and user interface. HAL-42 is a language which allows real time      epidemiological inquiry using automatically derived clinical encodings with any      health Ontology. This evaluation used SNOMED CT as the underlying Ontology. The      inquiries were performed on a population of 17,731 patients whose 50,000 clinical      records have all been fully encoded in SNOMED CT. Four subject matter experts      (SMEs) were asked independently to encode and run 10 rules/studies. The      inter-rater agreement was 74.8% (p=0.6526) with a Kappa statistic of 0.49217      (p=0.5722). The ten rules were divided into three easy rules, four moderate and      three complex rules. There was no significant difference in the SME's agreement      when representing easy and complex rules (p=0.6243). We conclude that although      the usability of the HAL-42 language is usable enough to achieve reasonable      inter-rater reliability, some training will be necessary to reach high levels of       reliability for ad hoc queries. We also conclude that SMEs are just as competent       to perform complex queries as easy queries of ontologically indexed clinical      data.

PMID- 18838293   - PURPOSE: We assessed the current state of commercial natural language processing       (NLP) engines for their ability to extract medication information from textual      clinical documents. METHODS: Two thousand de-identified discharge summaries and      family practice notes were submitted to four commercial NLP engines with the      request to extract all medication information. The four sets of returned results       were combined to create a comparison standard which was validated against a      manual, physician-derived gold standard created from a subset of 100 reports.      Once validated, the individual vendor results for medication names, strengths,      route, and frequency were compared against this automated standard with      precision, recall, and F measures calculated. RESULTS: Compared with the manual,       physician-derived gold standard, the automated standard was successful at      accurately capturing medication names (F measure=93.2%), but performed less well       with strength (85.3%) and route (80.3%), and relatively poorly with dosing      frequency (48.3%). Moderate variability was seen in the strengths of the four     vendors. The vendors performed better with the structured discharge summaries      than with the clinic notes in an analysis comparing the two document types.      CONCLUSION: Although automated extraction may serve as the foundation for a      manual review process, it is not ready to automate medication lists without human      intervention.

PMID- 18838292   - PURPOSE: Syndromic surveillance is aimed at early detection of disease outbreaks.      An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints      (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic      surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to      facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that      syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC      classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs      recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC      classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese. METHODS: We propose a      novel Chinese CC classification system leveraging a Chinese-English translation      module and an existing English CC classification approach. A set of 470 Chinese      key phrases was extracted from about one million Chinese CC records using      statistical methods. Based on the extracted key phrases, the system translates      Chinese text into English and classifies the translated CCs to syndromic      categories using an existing English CC classification system. RESULTS: Compared       to alternative approaches using a bilingual dictionary and a general-purpose      machine translation system, our approach performs significantly better in terms      of positive predictive value (PPV or precision), sensitivity (recall),      specificity, and F measure (the harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity), based on a      computational experiment using real-world CC records. CONCLUSIONS: Our design      provides satisfactory performance in classifying Chinese CCs into syndromic      categories for public health surveillance. The overall design of our system also       points out a potentially fruitful direction for multilingual CC systems that need      to handle languages beyond English and Chinese.

PMID- 18835211   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify the major challenges to      coordination between emergency department (ED) teams and emergency medical      services (EMS) teams. DESIGN: We conducted a series of focus groups involving      both ED and EMS team members using a crisis scenario as the basis of the focus      group discussion. We also collected organizational workflow data. RESULTS: We      identified three major challenges to coordination between ED and EMS teams      including ineffectiveness of current information and communication technologies,       lack of common ground, and breakdowns in information flow. DISCUSSION: The three       challenges highlight the importance of designing systems from socio-technical      perspective. In particular, these inter-team coordination systems must support      socio-technical issues such as awareness, context, and workflow between the two      teams.

PMID- 18819836   - BACKGROUND: It is generally acknowledged that Denmark is one, if not the, leading      country in terms of the use of information technology by its primary care      physicians. Other countries, notably excluding the United States and Canada, are       also advanced in terms of electronic medical records in general practitioner     offices and clinics. PURPOSE: This paper compares the status of primary care      physician office computing in Andalucia to that of Denmark by contrasting the      functionality of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the ability to      electronically communicate clinical information in both jurisdictions. METHODS: A      novel scoring system has been developed based on data gathered from databases      held by the respective jurisdictional programs, and interviews with individuals      involved in the deployment of the systems. The scoring methodology was applied      for the first time in a comparison of the degree of automation in primary care      physician offices in Denmark and the province of Alberta in Canada. It was also      used to compare Denmark and New Zealand. This paper is the third offering of this      method of scoring the adoption of electronic medical records in primary care      office settings which hopefully may be applicable to other health jurisdictions      at national, state, or provincial levels. RESULTS: Although similar in many      respects, there are significant differences between these two relatively      autonomous health systems which have led to the rates of uptake of physician      office computing. Particularly notable is the reality that the Danish primary      care physicians have individual "Electronic Medical Records" while in Andalucia,       the primary care physicians share a common record which when secondary care is      fully implemented will indeed be an "Electronic Health Record". CONCLUSION: It is      clear that the diffusion of technology, within the primary care physician sector       of the health care market, is subject to historical, financial, legal, cultural,       and social factors. This tale of two places illustrates the issues, and different      ways that they have been addressed.

PMID- 18809352   - BACKGROUND: To describe the use of videoconference telemedicine for providing      outpatient pulmonary consultation to a remote, underserved clinic site. METHODS:       Analysis of data from the Milwaukee Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC)      pulmonary telemedicine clinic. Pulmonary physicians at the Milwaukee VAMC provide      outpatient consultations with the use of videoconference technology to patients      located at the Iron Mountain VAMC in Iron Mountain, MI (346 km or 215 miles from       Milwaukee). Data on demographics, referral patterns, access to care, consultation      process, and outcomes are presented. RESULTS: A total of 314 patients (684      visits) received telemedicine consultations between January 1, 1998 and December       31, 2004. Common reasons for referral were abnormal radiology (38%), chronic      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (26%), and dyspnea (13%). Physical exam was       performed by the telemedicine registered nurse or respiratory therapists in 90%      of visits. Common diagnoses were COPD (29%), benign pulmonary nodule (11%),      bronchial asthma (6%), and lung cancer (6%). Telemedicine consultation resulted      in a change in management for 41% of patients. Only 8% of patients required an      in-person clinic visit at Milwaukee VAMC following a telemedicine visit.      Telemedicine saved patients 473,340 km or 294,120 miles of travel over the study       period. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of subspecialty services using telemedicine to      a remote underserved rural population provides improved patient access to      subspecialty care. Physicians are able to rely on medical history and radiology      to manage patients across a broad spectrum of complex pulmonary conditions with      the assistance of a non-physician health care provider at the remote site.

PMID- 18805731   - According to a common definition, interprofessional education (IPE) is described       as "occasions when two or more professions learn from and about each other to      improve collaboration and the quality of care". The Leonardo project under the      name European Interprofessional Education Network (EIPEN) in health and social      care, has been dealing with the challenges of interprofessional education. The      EIPEN project tries to develop a transnational network of universities and      employers in the six participating countries and at the same time to promote good      practices in interprofessional learning and teaching in health and social care.      IPE provides opportunities for students and practitioners to learn with, from and      about each other during qualifying and post-qualifying training and in their     practice. IPE in health and social care includes the education and training of      practitioners in human and animal medicine, dentistry, nursing, physiotherapy,      occupational therapy, pharmacy and all other health professions including public       and environmental health and health promotion, and social work. The outcomes of      the EIPEN Project will provide means, material and guidelines for the enhancement      of professional education in the multi-disciplinary field of Health Informatics.       The methodology on the development of the Greek Interprofessional Network was      based on a series of workshops aiming to document the educational process in      healthcare institutes and universities followed by the assessment of the needs      for the development of an interprofessional environment. The outcomes will      provide means, material and guidelines for the enhancement of professional      education in the multi-disciplinary field of Health Informatics.

PMID- 18805050   - PURPOSE: The speed and high potential impact of avian influenza's (AI) on local      bird populations, poultry economies and human health make timely and coordinated       characterization, assessment and response to possible threats essential. To      collaborate effectively, stakeholders (public health, medical, veterinary, and      agricultural professionals) must be able to communicate and record findings,      assessments, and actions in a standard fashion. We seek to discern a taxonomy of       concepts and relationships that are important to the stakeholder community when      sharing information about the characterization and assessment of an AI outbreak,       according to a consistent and common perspective, interpretation, and level of      detail. METHODS: To derive concepts relevant to AI characterization and      assessment, we reviewed selected journal articles, reporting and laboratory      forms, and public health websites associated with AI case reporting. We mapped      concepts to existing medical terminologies within the Unified Medical Language      System when possible, using the National Library of Medicine's MetaMap program.      RESULTS: From 54 distinct information sources, we extracted 1113 concepts, of      which 533 mapped to 15 medical terminologies; 580 did not map to specific      terminologies. Using a combination of semantic type-relationship matching and      expert consensus, we constructed the proposed taxonomy, with linkages to existing      terminologies where pragmatic. CONCLUSION: The proposed taxonomy describes core      knowledge, data and communication needs for the characterization and assessment      of AI outbreaks in the context of existing medical terminologies across different      domains. We also describe areas for further work.

PMID- 18801700   - PURPOSE: Medical language, as many technical languages, is rich with      morphologically complex words, many of which take their roots in Greek and      Latin--in which case they are called neoclassical compounds. Morphosemantic      analysis can help generate definitions of such words. The similarity of structure      of those compounds in several European languages has also been observed, which      seems to indicate that a same linguistic analysis could be applied to      neo-classical compounds from different languages with minor modifications.      METHODS: This paper reports work on the adaptation of a morphosemantic analyzer     dedicated to French (DeriF) to analyze English medical neo-classical compounds.      It presents the principles of this transposition and its current performance.      RESULTS: The analyzer was tested on a set of 1299 compounds extracted from the      WHO-ART terminology. 859 could be decomposed and defined, 675 of which      successfully. CONCLUSION: An advantage of this process is that complex linguistic      analyses designed for French could be successfully transposed to the analysis of       English medical neoclassical compounds, which confirmed our hypothesis of      transferability. The fact that the method was successfully applied to a Germanic       language such as English suggests that performances would be at least as high if       experimenting with Romance languages such as Spanish. Finally, the resulting      system can produce more complete analyses of English medical compounds than      existing systems, including a hierarchical decomposition and semantic gloss of      each word.

PMID- 18799352   - Spoken dialog systems have been increasingly employed to provide ubiquitous      access via telephone to information and services for the non-Internet-connected      public. They have been successfully applied in the health care context; however,       speech technology requires a considerable development investment. The advent of      VoiceXML reduced the proliferation of incompatible dialog formalisms, at the      expense of adding even more complexity. This paper introduces a novel      architecture for dialogue representation and interpretation, AdaRTE, which allows      developers to lay out dialog interactions through a high-level formalism,      offering both declarative and procedural features. AdaRTE's aim is to provide a      ground for deploying complex and adaptable dialogs whilst allowing      experimentation and incremental adoption of innovative speech technologies. It      enhances augmented transition networks with dynamic behavior, and drives multiple      back-end realizers, including VoiceXML. It has been especially targeted to the      health care context, because of the great scale and the need for reducing the      barrier to a widespread adoption of dialog systems.

PMID- 18790665   - OBJECTIVES: The integration of Human Factors is still insufficient in the design       and implementation phases of complex interactive systems such as Computerized      Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems. One of the problems is that human factors      specialists have difficulties to communicate their data and to have them properly      understood by the computer scientists in the design and implementation phases.      This paper presents a solution to this problem based on the creation of common      documentation supports using Software Engineering (SE) and Human-Computer     Interaction (HCI) methods. METHOD: The integration of SE and HCI methods and      models is an interesting means for modelling an organization's activities, with      software applications being part of these activities. Integrating these SE and      HCI methods and models allows case studies to be seen from the technical,      organizational and ergonomic perspectives, and also makes it easier to compare      current and future work situations. RESULTS: The exploitation of these techniques      allows the creation of common work supports that can be easily understandable by       computer scientists and relevant for re-engineering or design. In this paper, the      basic principles behind such communication supports are described and illustrated      by a real case study.

PMID- 18789876   - Managing time-stamped data is essential to clinical research activities and often      requires the use of considerable domain knowledge. Adequately representing and      integrating temporal data and domain knowledge is difficult with the database      technologies used in most clinical research systems. There is often a disconnect       between the database representation of research data and corresponding domain      knowledge of clinical research concepts. In this paper, we present a set of      methodologies for undertaking ontology-based specification of temporal      information, and discuss their application to the verification of      protocol-specific temporal constraints among clinical trial activities. Our     approach allows knowledge-level temporal constraints to be evaluated against      operational trial data stored in relational databases. We show how the Semantic      Web ontology and rule languages OWL and SWRL, respectively, can support tools for     research data management that automatically integrate low-level representations      of relational data with high-level domain concepts used in study design.

PMID- 18789754   - After a critical review of the present architecture of SNOMED CT, addressing both      logical and ontological issues, we present a roadmap toward an overall      improvement and recommend the following actions: SNOMED CT's ontology,      dictionary, and information model components should be kept separate. SNOMED CT's      upper level should be re-arranged according to a standard upper level ontology.      SNOMED CT concepts should be assigned to the four disjoint groups: classes,      instances, relations, and meta-classes. SNOMED CT's binary relations should be      reduced to a set of canonical ones, following existing recommendations.      Taxonomies should be cleansed and split into disjoint partitions. The number of      full definitions should be increased. Finally, new approaches are proposed for     modeling part-whole hierarchies, as well as the integration of qualifier     relations into a unified framework. All proposed modifications can be expressed      by the computationally tractable description logic EL(++).

PMID- 18789753   - BACKGROUND: While much is known about how to do usability testing of stationary      Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems, less is known about how to do usability       testing of mobile ICT systems intended for use in clinical settings. AIM: Our aim      is to provide a set of empirically based recommendations for usability testing of      mobile ICT for clinical work. METHOD: We have conducted usability tests of two      mobile EPR systems. Both tests have been done in full-scale models of hospital      settings, and with multiple users simultaneously. We report here on the      methodological aspects of these tests. RESULTS: We found that the usability of      the mobile EPR systems to a large extent were determined by factors that went      beyond that of the graphical user interface. These factors include ergonomic      aspects such as the ability to have both hands free, and social aspects such as      to what extent the systems disturbs the face-to-face interaction between the      health worker and the patient. CONCLUSIONS: To be able to measure usability      issues that go beyond what can be found by a traditional stationary user     interface evaluation, it is necessary to conduct usability tests of mobile EPR     systems in physical environments that simulate the conditions of the work      situation at a high level of realism. It is further in most cases necessary to      test with a number of test subjects simultaneously.

PMID- 18786852   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the foci, activities, methods, and results of a 4-year     research project identifying the unintended consequences of computerized provider     order entry (CPOE). METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach, we identified and      categorized into nine types 380 examples of the unintended consequences of CPOE      gleaned from fieldwork data and a conference of experts. We then conducted a      national survey in the U.S.A. to discover how hospitals with varying levels of      infusion, a measure of CPOE sophistication, recognize and deal with unintended      consequences. The research team, with assistance from experts, identified      strategies for managing the nine types of unintended adverse consequences and      developed and disseminated tools for CPOE implementers to help in addressing      these consequences. RESULTS: Hospitals reported that levels of infusion are quite      high and that these types of unintended consequences are common. Strategies for     avoiding or managing the unintended consequences are similar to best practices      for CPOE success published in the literature. CONCLUSION: Development of a      taxonomy of types of unintended adverse consequences of CPOE using qualitative      methods allowed us to craft a national survey and discover how widespread these      consequences are. Using mixed methods, we were able to structure an approach for       addressing the skillful management of unintended consequences as well.

PMID- 18786851   - OBJECTIVES: Effective and timely communication of information is essential for     quality patient care. Information and communication technology tools have the      potential to transform and enable health care processes to be more accurate,      timely, and integrated. This study describes the development, implementation, and      evaluation of an electronic whiteboard in a General Internal Medicine (GIM)      inpatient unit of an acute care hospital. METHODS: The development,      implementation, and evaluation of the inpatient whiteboard included scope      discussions, workflow analyses, communication and training, and issues and      enhancement reporting, all managed through a central project team. Evaluation of       the whiteboard was two-fold: a survey given to allied health, nursing and      physician disciplines (n=120), and an audit performed on whiteboard usage.      RESULTS: The whiteboard displays relevant, real-time patient information, in a      single, highly visible, user-friendly display. With a quick glance at the      whiteboard, one can get an accurate snapshot view of the current patient activity      in the unit. Approximately 71% of survey participants believed that the      whiteboard improves and standardizes communication within the care team. Further,      approximately 62% of the participants agreed that the whiteboard saves them time       when searching for information on a patient and their care plan. In addition, the      whiteboard has had an impact on the work practices of many GIM care providers,      and it along with its users has acted together as agents for positive change.      Whiteboard utilization has significantly increased since its implementation.      CONCLUSIONS: The success of the whiteboard is in part due to overall change      management methodologies through collaborative development throughout the project      development lifecycle and subsequent continuous improvement initiatives. The      multidisciplinary care team embraced the tool, took ownership of it, and tailored      it to meet their needs.

PMID- 18783983   - OBJECTIVE: To explore differences in perception and acceptance levels of      Female-focused Healthcare Applications (FHA). This study will focus on the      different demographic data between female healthcare and non-healthcare workers.       METHOD: Questionnaires were used in a revised technology acceptance model      entitled as the Female-focused Acceptance Model (FAM) to examine the perception      and acceptance of the test subjects, using a quantitative method. RESULTS: Within      Singapore 1071 females participated in the study (71.4% response rate). The      sample comprised of 241 healthcare workers (HC) and 830 non-healthcare (NHC)      workers. The questionnaires were distributed to participants, by research      administrators across the country, such as the National University Hospital      Women's Clinics and the National Healthcare Group polyclinics. Regression      analyses were performed to explain how different predictors may be correlated to       each other in terms of significance. Both groups of women who believe that FHA is      easy to use are confident that it will have beneficiary outcomes (p<0.001) and      intend to use FHA (HC: p=0.012, NHC: p<0.001). The HC group who were in education      to the university level intend to use FHA (p=0.047). The NHC group who have a      good impression of current healthcare technologies (p<0.001) or were in education      to a higher level (p=0.025) intend to use FHA. NHC who are not influenced by      their family and friend's views of FHA feel that the devices would be useful      (p=0.013). NHC who are satisfied with current healthcare technologies (p=0.048),       or have previous experience of using medical devices (p=0.033) think FHA would be      easy to use. CONCLUSION: This study shows that FAM works well for detecting      social variables which may influence "female" acceptance (with the R square      values of the FAM ranging from 54% to 68%). It presents design implications for     future FHA - The direct support from HC coupled with the user-friendly personal      device ensures that the technology is an effective enabler for personal      well-being and self-managed healthcare. In order to encourage women to adopt and       use these applications, there is a need to communicate the potential usefulness      of the applications to women. To encourage the pregnant women to use FHA (in the       area of prenatal care), issues such as their experience with medical devices and       social status should be considered. The findings and their implications presented      here were obtained from a single study that targeted a possible user group in      Singapore. Further research could be carried out in the future to access similar       issues across broader cultural and social horizons.

PMID- 18778967   - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of cell phone wireless text messaging      for improving adherence to a healthy behaviour. DESIGN: A randomised, unblinded,       controlled trial was conducted with 102 subjects, 18 years or older, each having       a cell phone and willing to take 1 vitamin C pill per day for 1 month for     preventive reasons. Intervention group participants received text messaging      reminders and were asked to acknowledge receiving their messages after taking the      vitamins, whereas control group subjects had no text messaging activity.      MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported adherence and the number of participant text messages      acknowledging vitamins taken. RESULTS: Both groups reported an increased      adherence after the trial: by 246% for the intervention group and by 131% for the      control group. There was a non-significant difference between the two groups at      endpoint: an average difference of 0.8 between the number of pills missed in the       last week of the trial (2.5 out of 7 in the intervention and 3.3 out of 7 in the       control group) with a power of 0.54. The study revealed a significant correlation      (coefficient=-0.352, sig.=0.01) between the average number of text messaging      acknowledgements sent by the intervention group participants and the number of      pills they reported missed during the last week of the trial. CONCLUSION: This      was a small randomised controlled trial with inconclusive but encouraging      results. It suggests a new approach in addressing insufficient adherence in      outpatient conditions and shows that the use of information technology tools for       compliance warrants further research.

PMID- 18768345   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study applied a modified version of the extended      technology acceptance model (TAM2) to examine the factors determining the      acceptance of health IT applications by caregivers in long-term care facilities.       The antecedent variables, including social influence factors such as subjective      norm and image were examined together with demographic variables including age,      job level, long-term care work experience and computer skills in regard to their       impact on caregivers' acceptance of health IT applications. METHODS: A      self-administered questionnaire was developed based on the validated items from      TAM2. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey using convenience      sample. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling techniques      were used to validate our causal model. RESULTS: Perceived usefulness, perceived       ease of use and computer skills had significant positive impact, whereas image      had significant negative impact on caregivers' intention to use health IT      applications. Image, subjective norm and computer skills also indirectly impacted      on intention through the mediating factor of ease of use. Ease of use, subjective      norm and job level also determined perceived usefulness. The other demographic      factors (including age and long-term care work experience) did not have any      significant effect on caregivers' acceptance of a health IT application. Our     model explains 34% of caregivers' intention to use an introduced IT application      before any hands-on experience with the system established. CONCLUSIONS: The      planners and managers should ensure that a health IT application to be introduced      into a long-term care facility is useful and easy to use. Effort should be      focused on forming a positive social norm for the introduction of the new      innovation and improving caregivers' computer skills. Securing the managers' and       senior nurses' support for the innovation at the onset of the project is critical      for success. Finally the caregivers appear to dislike the idea of increased IT      ability will elevate their status.

PMID- 18762445   - BACKGROUND: Shared homecare is increasingly common, and in order to develop ICT      that support such complex cooperative and interdisciplinary work it is crucial to      obtain an understanding of work processes at the clinical level before the      development is initiated. It is also crucial, but difficult, to correctly      transfer this insight to the development team. METHOD: User-centered scenario      building in interdisciplinary working groups is applied for capturing cooperative      work routines, information demands, and other central preconditions in shared      homecare. RESULTS: Use of scenarios for analysis of cooperative work and as      information carrier is described via a case from the multi-disciplinary OLD@HOME       project. Both current and future work scenarios were elicited. To illustrate the       process of transforming scenarios into more technical descriptions (use cases),      and finally into an application, examples showing the transparency in resulting      use cases and in the implemented system are provided. CONCLUSION: In this case      study, scenarios proved to be useful not only in initial system development      phases but throughout the entire development process, improving accessibility and      assessment of end user needs. For the development team, scenarios assisted in      solving usability issues, and served as a basis for describing use cases and for       further system development. More importantly, the shared care scenarios ensured      the provision of different perspectives on common work processes, which are often      neglected in conventional requirements specifications. This also improved      understanding between different clinical groups and between clinicians and      developers.

PMID- 18760960   - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the theory that on-line clinical decision support      systems can improve patients' safety among hospitalised individuals has gained      greater acceptance. However, the feasibility of implementing such a system in a      middle or low-income country has rarely been studied. Understanding the current      prescription process and a proper needs assessment of prescribers can act as the       key to successful implementation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to      explore physicians' opinions on the current prescription process, and the      expected benefits and perceived obstacles to employ Computerised Physician Order       Entry in an Iranian teaching hospital. METHODS: Initially, the interview      guideline was developed through focus group discussions with eight experts. Then       semi-structured interviews were held with 19 prescribers. After verbatim      transcription, inductive thematic analysis was performed on empirical data. Forty      hours of on-looker observations were performed in different wards to explore the       current prescription process. RESULTS: The current prescription process was      identified as a physician-centred, top-down, model, where prescribers were found       to mostly rely on their memories as well as being overconfident. Some errors may       occur during different paper-based registrations, transcriptions and transfers.      Physician opinions on Computerised Physician Order Entry were categorised into      expected benefits and perceived obstacles. Confidentiality issues, reduction of      medication errors and educational benefits were identified as three themes in the      expected benefits category. High cost, social and cultural barriers, data entry      time and problems with technical support emerged as four themes in the perceived       obstacles category. CONCLUSIONS: The current prescription process has a high      possibility of medication errors. Although there are different barriers      confronting the implementation and continuation of Computerised Physician Order     Entry in Iranian hospitals, physicians have a willingness to use them if these      systems provide significant benefits. A pilot study in a limited setting and a      comprehensive analysis of health outcomes and economic indicators should be      performed, to assess the merits of introducing Computerised Physician Order Entry      with decision support capabilities in Iran.

PMID- 18760959   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of a u-healthcare service using Zigbee and      mobile phone for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus or heart diseases.      MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July to October, 2005, 29 patients were enrolled in      our study. Two selected u-healthcare items, ECG and blood glucose measurement,      were monitored. Twenty patients were provided with ZigBee built-in blood      glucometer and mobile phones, and were instructed on using a web service where      the measured blood glucose could be transmitted directly to the web and be      administrated. Nine patients participated in ECG monitoring, by using a wireless,      transmittable ECG recording instrument equipped with ZigBee protocol attached to       their chest. Daily average transmission frequency, rate of transmission loss, and      error reasons were analyzed. In addition, the patients were asked to score their       degree of satisfaction about the sensors and u-healthcare services. RESULTS: The       mean transmission frequencies were 2.1 times/day in blood glucose monitoring and       6.1 times/day in ECG. The patients' satisfaction scores of the blood glucometer     and service used in this research were 8.59 and 9.01 of 10 points, respectively.       The mean satisfaction scores about ECG sensor and ECG monitoring services were      5.79 and 7.29, respectively. DISCUSSION: Despite the many problems still      encountered such as technological problems related to sensors and some problems      like battery replacement, we could transfer the data of glucometer and ECG      sensors to web-server via ZigBee protocol. Authors think the ZigBee could be one       of components of wireless u-healthcare systems in the future due to its      advantages of lower power consumption.

PMID- 18760661   - OBJECTIVES: Identification and analysis of privacy and security related issues      that occur when health information is exchanged between health care      organizations. METHODS: Based on a generic scenario questions were formulated to       reveal the occurring issues. Possible answers were verified in literature.      RESULTS: Ensuring secure health information exchange across organizations      requires a standardization of security measures that goes beyond organizational      boundaries, such as global definitions of professional roles, global standards      for patient consent and semantic interoperable audit logs. CONCLUSION: As to be      able to fully address the privacy and security issues in interoperable EHRs and      the long-life virtual EHR it is necessary to realize a paradigm shift from      storing all incoming information in a local system to retrieving information from      external systems whenever that information is deemed necessary for the care of      the patient.

PMID- 18760660   - OBJECTIVE: To compare how nurses in two different paper-based systems perceive      the impact of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system on their     medication-related activities. SETTING: 13 non-surgical, adult inpatient wards in      a Dutch academic hospital. METHODS: Questionnaire survey of 295 nurses before and      304 nurses after the implementation of a CPOE system. These nurses worked with      two different paper-based medication systems before the implementation:      'Kardex-system' and 'TIMED-system'. In the Kardex-system, the structure of the      nursing medication work was similar to that of after the CPOE implementation,      while in the TIMED-system, it was different. 'Adaptive Structuration Theory'      (AST) was used to interpret the results. RESULTS: The response rates were 52.2%      (154/295) before and 44.7% (136/304) after the implementation. Kardex-nurses      reported more positive effects than TIMED-nurses. TIMED-nurses reported that the       computerized system was more inflexible, more difficult to work with, and slower       than the TIMED-system. In the TIMED group, the overall mean score of the      computerized process was not significantly different from that of the paper-based      process. Moreover, nurses in both groups were more satisfied with the      post-implementation process than with the pre-implementation process.      Nevertheless, none of groups reported a better workflow support in the      computerized system when compared to that of the paper-based systems.      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that not only the technology but also large      differences between pre- and post-implementation work structure influence the      perceptions of users, and probably make the transition more difficult. This study      also suggests that greater satisfaction with a system may not necessarily be a      reflection of better workflow support.

PMID- 18757234   - We report from a longitudinal laboratory-based usability evaluation of a health      care information system. The purpose of the study was to inquire into the nature       of usability problems experienced by novice and expert users, and to see to what       extend usability problems of a health care information system may or may not      disappear over time, as the nurses get more familiar with it-if time heals poor     design? As our method for studying this, we conducted a longitudinal study with      two key studies. A usability evaluation was conducted with novice users when an      electronic patient record system was being deployed in a large hospital. After     the nurses had used the system in their daily work for 15 months, we repeated the      evaluation. Our results show that time does not heal. Although some problems were      not experiences as severe, they still remained after 1 year of extensive use. On       the basis of our findings, we discuss implications for evaluating usability in      health care.

PMID- 18752989   - PURPOSE: The use of a computer during general/family practice consultations is on      the rise across the world, yet little is known about the effect the use of a      computer may have on the all important physician-patient relationship. This paper     provides a framework for further analysis of computers influence on      physician-patient interactions during general practice consultations. METHODS:      This is an observational qualitative study informed by hermeneutics and the      phenomenological tradition of Irving Goffman, based in Australian general      practice. A single digital video recording of 141 patient encounters over 6      months was made and imported into a tagging software program to facilitate      analysis. Through an iterative process several keys and behaviours were described      for doctors, patients and the computers in the interaction. RESULTS: Physicians      tended to fall into two categories; unipolar-those who tend to maintain the lower     pole of their body facing the computer except were examination of the patient or       some other action demands otherwise, and bipolar-those physicians who repeatedly       alternate the orientation of their lower pole between the computer and the      patient. Patients tended to demonstrate behaviours that focused on the physician       to the exclusion of the computer (dyadic) and included the computer in the      consultation (triadic). The computer was also seen to influence the      physician-patient interaction passively or actively. CONCLUSION: In describing      and categorising the behaviours of the computer, in addition to the humans in the      consultation, a framework is provided for further analytical work on the impact      of computers in general practice.

PMID- 18752988   - INTRODUCTION: With PACS and medical imaging technology maturing, the importance      of organizational maturity and effective deployment of PACS in the hospital      enterprise are becoming significant. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is      twofold. Firstly, PACS literature on maturity and evolvability in the hospital      enterprise is analyzed, resulting in an overview of the relevant developments      concerning maturity of PACS. Secondly, this paper looks at the development of a      maturity model for PACS technology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using structured search       queries, we identified 34 papers reporting relevant aspects of maturity and      evolvability of PACS. From the results of a meta-analytic review on PACS maturity      and evolvability, we propose a model--the PACS maturity model (PMM)--that      describes five levels of PACS maturity and the corresponding process focus.      CONCLUSION: We argue that this model can help hospitals to gain insights into      their (strategic) objectives for growth and maturity with regard to PACS, the      electronic patient record (EPR) and other health information systems. Moreover,      the proposed model can be applied as a valuable tool for organizational      assessments, monitoring and benchmarking purposes. Hence, the PMM contributes to       an integral alignment model for PACS technology.

PMID- 18752987   - OBJECTIVES: This research investigated (1) the attitudes of dental patients      toward searching online for dental information and (2) patients attitudes and      expectations towards a web-based 3D virtual reality program for clinical      dentistry. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted in six clinics across      two cities in China. Dental patients visiting the six clinics were invited to      participate in the study. All subjects browsed a webpage containing the 3D      virtual reality dental program. The new media was supplemented as a consultive      system for patients into the traditional pattern of seeking dental care      procedure. Subjects then completed a questionnaire detailing their attitudes      toward their experience with the software. The questionnaire responses were then       collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 45% of respondents reported having searched      information online before receiving dental care. Respondents held different      attitudes towards the online dental information, with a majority reporting a      reliance on it but with reservations. Over 50% of respondents held positive      attitudes to the web-based virtual reality dental information program, while 21%       reported negative views toward the new method. Most respondents reported that the      web-based virtual reality program was superior to traditional static web pages,      but only as a supplementary material. Respondents also indicated that internet      speed may likely be a major determinant to their future usage of such a system.      CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a considerable portion of respondents      conduct their own internet searches for related dental information before seeking      professional advice on dental care. Most of the respondents reported positive      attitudes towards a web-based virtual reality program for clinical dentistry.      However, the current speed of internet connections in China is a major area of      concern for the future application and uptake of web-based virtual reality dental      software.

PMID- 18723389   - OBJECTIVE: The paper presents an application of the "Fit between Individuals,      Task and Technology" (FITT) framework to analyze the      socio-organizational-technical factors that influence IT adoption in the      healthcare domain. METHOD: The FITT framework was employed as the theoretical      instrument for a retrospective analysis of a 15-year effort in implementing IT      systems and eHealth services in the context of a Regional Health Information      Network in Crete. Quantitative and qualitative research methods, interviews and      participant observations were employed to gather data from a case study that      involved the entire region of Crete. RESULTS: The detailed analysis of the case      study based on the FITT framework, showed common features, but also differences      of IT adoption within the various health organizations. The emerging picture is a      complex nexus of factors contributing to IT adoption, and multi-level      interventional strategies to promote IT use. CONCLUSION: The work presented in      this paper shows the applicability of the FITT framework in explaining the      complexity of aspects observed in the implementation of healthcare information      systems. The reported experiences reveal that fit management can be viewed as a      system with a feedback loop that is never really stable, but ever changing based       on external factors or deliberate interventions. Management of fit, therefore,      becomes a constant and complex task for the whole life cycle of IT systems.

PMID- 18706852   - Due to its complex nature, modern biomedical research has become increasingly      interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature. Although a necessity,      interdisciplinary biomedical collaboration is difficult. There is, however, a      growing body of literature on the study and fostering of collaboration in fields       such as computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and information science (IS).       These studies of collaboration provide insight into how to potentially alleviate       the difficulties of interdisciplinary collaborative research. We, therefore,      undertook a cross cutting study of science and engineering collaboratories to      identify emergent themes. We review many relevant collaboratory concepts: (a)      general collaboratory concepts across many domains: communication, common      workspace and coordination, and data sharing and management, (b) specific      collaboratory concepts of particular biomedical relevance: data integration and      analysis, security structure, metadata and data provenance, and interoperability       and data standards, (c) environmental factors that support collaboratories:      administrative and management structure, technical support, and available funding      as critical environmental factors, and (d) future considerations for biomedical      collaboration: appropriate training and long-term planning. In our opinion, the      collaboratory concepts we discuss can guide planning and design of future      collaborative infrastructure by biomedical informatics researchers to alleviate      some of the difficulties of interdisciplinary biomedical collaboration.

PMID- 18701344   - Weblogs (blogs), together with podcasts and wikis are part of the larger body of       next-generation communication applications dubbed "web 2.0." Within the specific       area of health care, little attention has been devoted to understanding what      applications are available to the lay public and how these are being used. In      this study, a literature review on blogs and blogging practices was conducted,      followed by case study analyses of two separate sites that use blogging tools to       help patients and other lay web end-users record health-related experiences. This      paper explores the diverse purposes for which blogging applications can be (or     are being) used in relation to health and introduces the idea of "health      goal-oriented" blogging. The discussion focuses on relevant informatics questions      that arise with respect to the use of blogs and makes suggestions for subsequent       research.

PMID- 18675583   - PURPOSE: The use of information technology in the health care sector and      especially in hospitals offers great potential for improving the quality of      services provided and the efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel, but also      for reducing the organizational expenses. However, the main question that arises       according to the literature is whether hospital personnel are willing to use      state of the art information technology while performing their tasks. This study       attempts to address this issue by developing and testing a modified technology      acceptance model taking into consideration other relevant models found in the      literature. METHOD: The original TAM has been extended to include some exogenous       variables in order to examine HIS acceptance by Greek hospital personnel.      Correlation, explanatory and confirmation factor analysis was performed to test      the reliability and validity of the measurement model. The structural equation      modeling technique has also been used to evaluate the causal model. RESULTS: The       results indicate that perceived usefulness, ease of use, social influence,      attitude, facilitating conditions and self-efficacy significantly affect hospital      personnel behavioral intention. Training has a strong indirect impact on      behavioral intention through the mediators of facilitating condition and ease of       use. Furthermore, the existence of significant positive effects between      self-efficacy and social influence, perceived usefulness and anxiety, and      facilitating conditions and social influence is also supported. CONCLUSIONS: The       proposed model can explain 87% of the variance of behavioral intention indicating      that the core constructs of the technology acceptance models have a strong and      statistically significant influence on hospital personnel usage intention.

PMID- 18674963   - PURPOSE: To identify and characterize enabling factors that support a continuous       adaptation of technology and work practices in the health care sector. METHODS:      Cross-case analysis of two longitudinal ethnographic studies of managing the      gradual adaptation of electronic patient records, one in Canada and one Norway.      RESULTS: The cross-case analysis revealed that technology-in-use practices      developed more rapidly in one of the cases, and one of the major driving forces      was the establishment of a special committee and the associated project meetings.      Based on the literature and grounded in the empirical observations, we complement      and expand the notion of project meetings as composed of continuous      reflection-on-practice activities to construct technology-in-use practices.      CONCLUSION: We characterize reflection-on-practice activities as frequent      encounters of negotiations of work practices and technology use, providing      internal actors a space for systematic evaluation of suggested changes. Further     we argue that representatives of the affected professions should not only      participate, but also have a mandate to make and evaluate decisions of the      technology-in-use practices of the particular group.

PMID- 18657471   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the state of health information technology (HIT) adoption      and use in seven industrialized nations. DESIGN: We used a combination of      literature review, as well as interviews with experts in individual nations, to      determine use of key information technologies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined      rates of electronic health record (EHR) use in ambulatory care and hospital      settings, along with current activities in health information exchange (HIE) in      seven countries: the United States (U.S.), Canada, United Kingdom (UK), Germany,       Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand (NZ). RESULTS: Four nations (the UK,      Netherlands, Australia, and NZ) had nearly universal use of EHRs among general      practitioners (each >90%) and Germany was far along (40-80%). The U.S. and Canada      had a minority of ambulatory care physicians who used EHRs consistently (10-30%).      While there are no high quality data for the hospital setting from any of the      nations we examined, evidence suggests that only a small fraction of hospitals      (<10%) in any single country had the key components of an EHR. HIE efforts were a      high priority in all seven nations but the early efforts have had varying degrees      of active clinical data exchange. CONCLUSION: We examined HIT adoption in seven      industrialized nations and found that many have achieved high levels of      ambulatory EHR adoption but lagged with respect to inpatient EHR and HIE. These      data suggest that increased efforts will be needed if interoperable EHRs are soon      to become ubiquitous in these seven nations.

PMID- 18644745   - The adoption of health information systems is seen world wide as one method to      mitigate the widening health care demand and supply gap. The purpose of this      review was to identify the current state of knowledge about health information      systems adoption in primary care. The goal was to understand factors and      influencers affecting implementation outcomes from previous health information      systems implementations experiences. A comprehensive systematic literature review      of peer reviewed and grey literature was undertaken to identify the current state      of knowledge regarding the implementation of health information systems. A total       of 6 databases, 27 journal websites, 20 websites from grey sources, 9 websites      from medical colleges and professional associations as well as 22      government/commission websites were searched. The searches returned almost 3700      article titles. Eighty-six articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria.      Articles show that systems' graphical user interface design quality, feature      functionality, project management, procurement and users' previous experience      affect implementation outcomes. Implementers had concerns about factors such as      privacy, patient safety, provider/patient relations, staff anxiety, time factors,      quality of care, finances, efficiency, and liability. The review showed that      implementers can insulate the project from such concerns by establishing strong      leadership, using project management techniques, establishing standards and      training their staff to ensure such risks do not compromise implementation      success. The review revealed the concept of socio-technical factors, or "fit"      factors, that complicate health information systems deployment. The      socio-technical perspective considers how the technical features of a health      information system interact with the social features of a health care work      environment. The review showed that quality of care, patient safety and      provider/patient relations were not, positively or negatively, affected by      systems implementation. The fact that no articles were found reviewing the      benefits or drawbacks of health information systems accruing to patients should      be concern to adopters, payers and jurisdictions. No studies were found that      compared how provider-patient interactions in interviews are effected when      providers used electronic health information systems as opposed to the paper     equivalent. Very little information was available about privacy and liability.

PMID- 18640871   - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to clarify the major concepts related       to architecture and design of patient identity management software systems so      that an implementor looking to solve a specific integration problem in the      context of a Master Patient Index (MPI) and a deduplication engine can address      the relevant issues. METHODS: The ideas presented are illustrated in the context       of a reference use case from Integrating the Health Enterprise Patient Identifier     Cross-referencing (IHE PIX) profile. Sound software engineering principles using       the latest design paradigm of model driven architecture (MDA) are applied to      define different views of the architecture. RESULTS: The main contribution of the      paper is a clear software architecture roadmap for implementors of patient      identity management systems. Conceptual design in terms of static and dynamic      views of the interfaces is provided as an example of platform independent model.       This makes the roadmap applicable to any specific solutions of MPI, deduplication      library or software platform. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders in need of integration of      MPIs and deduplication engines can evaluate vendor specific solutions and      software platform technologies in terms of fundamental concepts and can make      informed decisions that preserve investment. This also allows freedom from vendor     lock-in and the ability to kick-start integration efforts based on a solid      architecture.

PMID- 18639487   - PURPOSE: In a previous study, we compared a prototype ecological display (ED)      that represented physiological data in a structured pictorial format with two bar     graph displays [J.A. Effken, Improving clinical decision making through      ecological interfaces, Ecol. Psych. 18 (2006) 283-318]. In ED and the first bar     graph display, data were grouped hierarchically based on a cognitive work      analysis (CWA); in the second bar graph display they were grouped as usually      collected. Treatment efficiency (i.e., percentage of time seven variables in the       CWA model were in target range) improved similarly with the two displays      incorporating the CWA order for intensive care unit (ICU) residents, but not for       novice ICU nurses. Hypothesized reasons for this result included: insufficient      practice with novel displays; use of identical histories across displays;      insufficient clinical knowledge; and the variables used in the efficiency      analysis, which included only one of ED's four integrated design elements. In the      current study we tested these hypotheses. METHODS: We asked ICU nurses assigned      to three knowledge groups based on intensive care and hemodynamic monitoring      pretests to identify and treat oxygenation problems presented via ED and the      first bar graph display (BGD) in an experimental laboratory simulation. We      measured the impact of display, clinical scenario, data level, knowledge,      presentation order, and practice extent on event recognition, treatment      efficiency, cognitive workload, and user satisfaction. RESULTS: The two displays       produced little difference in recognition speed or overall cognitive workload,      but user satisfaction was greater with ED. When 12 variables were included in the      analysis, treatment efficiency improved with ED; when only 7 were measured, BGD      prevailed. The results suggest benefits for the kind of synthesis provided in ED,      but also a potential limitation. If too many different pictorial formats are used      in a display, detecting critical events may be more difficult.

PMID- 18639486   - There is growing interest in the development of standards which structure      information round discrete clinical concepts, in a way that supports system      development and interoperability. Most notable are the openEHR Archetypes and      Templates, and HL7 Templates. A project is described which explored the potential      for these to engage and support clinical practitioners in developing clinical      information standards in an open and accessible way. The project defined a      clinical template as a clinical information model, which could be used to define       the content of a form in a health record system, for example a continence      assessment. The project followed three phases: professional development,      including networking for content development; library implementation, including      modelling and processes for managing content and relating to information      standards; and implementation in working systems in a manner that is      professionally acceptable. The project findings are encouraging although there      remain some important issues to be explored in further work. The topic has now      emerged as an important area of standards development, and a useful focus for     international cooperation.

PMID- 18639485   - PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines are useful tools to standardize and improve health      care. The automation of the guideline execution process is a basic step towards      its widespread use in medical centres. This paper presents an analysis and a      comparison of eight systems that allow the enactment of clinical guidelines in a       (semi) automatic fashion. METHODS: This paper presents a review of the literature      (2000-2007) collected from medical databases as well as international conferences      in the medical informatics area. RESULTS: Eight systems containing a guideline      execution engine were selected. The language used to represent the guidelines as       well as the architecture of these systems were compared. Different aspects have      been assessed for each system, such as the integration with external elements or       the coordination mechanisms used in the execution of clinical guidelines.      Security and terminology issues complement the above study. CONCLUSIONS: Although      these systems could be beneficial for clinicians and patients, it is an ongoing      research area, and they are not yet fully implemented and integrated into      existing careflow management systems and hence used in daily practice in health      care institutions.

PMID- 18621574   - BACKGROUND: Semantic interoperability is a basic challenge to be met for new      generations of distributed, communicating and co-operating health information      systems (HIS) enabling shared care and e-Health. Analysis, design, implementation      and maintenance of such systems and intrinsic architectures have to follow a      unified development methodology. METHODS: The Generic Component Model (GCM) is      used as a framework for modeling any system to evaluate and harmonize state of      the art architecture development approaches and standards for health information       systems as well as to derive a coherent architecture development framework for     sustainable, semantically interoperable HIS and their components. The proposed      methodology is based on the Rational Unified Process (RUP), taking advantage of      its flexibility to be configured for integrating other architectural approaches      such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), ISO      10746, and HL7 Development Framework (HDF). RESULTS: Existing architectural      approaches have been analyzed, compared and finally harmonized towards an      architecture development framework for advanced health information systems.      CONCLUSION: Starting with the requirements for semantic interoperability derived       from paradigm changes for health information systems, and supported in formal      software process engineering methods, an appropriate development framework for     semantically interoperable HIS has been provided. The usability of the framework       has been exemplified in a public health scenario.

PMID- 18620903   - Recent advancements in modern medical diagnoses have required a huge increase of       the use of equipment such as CT and ultrasound machines. Correspondingly, the      storage and dissemination of these medical images have become an important issue       to medical professionals. Unfortunately, management of these images has      traditionally been slow and cumbersome. With the prevalence of the personal      computer, however, along with increased network bandwidth, it is now possible to       handle this information electronically as well as wirelessly. The Picture      Archiving and Communication System (PACS) is at the forefront of this revolution.      Yet, commercially available PACS software is generally prohibitively expensive      for hospitals with limited financial resources. A dilemma among many hospitals is      deciding how to acquire and implement the proper PACS system without unduly      affecting the budget. In this paper, a full function, efficient, and economical      PACS system is presented as a viable, non-compromising option for many small and       medium-sized hospitals. This system, designed and developed mainly by the      physicians and technicians of Puli Christian Hospital (PCH), with the assistance       from academia, allows for customization to fit the needs of individual hospitals.      This system can be used as the foundation of a hospital's health information      infrastructure and to enhance e-hospital service.

PMID- 18619897   - A 2007 national public opinion survey of 1404 Americans revealed variations in      sentiments concerning the desirability of several mobile healthcare technologies       based on RFID. The survey appears to be the first reasonably national public      opinion survey of US adults concerning their attitudes towards mobile healthcare       technology. The survey revealed high levels of interest in emergency intervention      services, but much less so in health information and monitoring services.      Interest in RFID personal medical technology was positively associated with high       levels of trust in others and social support. At the same time, a small minority       were negatively disposed towards such applications. In those cases, the negative       sentiment appears heightened when the mobile healthcare application is offered in      a modality attached to the body as opposed to a somewhat more physically remote      option, i.e., attached to one's cell phone.

PMID- 18619896   - INTRODUCTION: In the developed world, doctors use the Internet to support the      delivery of health care. Their usage patterns are explained by Rogers' Diffusion       of Innovations. There is no knowledge of Internet usage by doctors in the      developing world. METHODS: In July 2006, 2600 survey forms were posted in the      first national survey of South African (SA) General Practitioners' (GPs) use of      the Internet. A sample of non-responders was followed up. The aim was to      determine SA GPs' Internet usage patterns, to compare them to world usage, and to      examine them in the light of Diffusion of Innovations. RESULTS: A 10% usable      response rate was a major weakness, but similar surveys are unlikely to be more      representative. 89% of SA GPs have Internet access, home usage is high, and      overall usage patterns are equivalent to the usage patterns of international      studies. DISCUSSION: In spite of the overall technological under-development in      South Africa, as predicted by Diffusion of Innovations, SA GPs have adopted the      technology, and use it for health care in much the same way as their     international counterparts. Further studies on some of the details will be      valuable. CONCLUSION: The indications are that SA GPs will reap the benefits of      the Internet as it continues to evolve, and translate these into improved health       care delivery in South Africa.

PMID- 18614395   - INTRODUCTION: This paper presents work to define a representation for clinical      research queries that can be used for the design of generic interfaces to      electronic healthcare record (EHR) systems. Given the increasing prevalence of      EHR systems, with the potential to accumulate life-long health records,      opportunities exist to analyse and mine these for new knowledge. This potential      is presently limited by many factors, one of which is the challenge of extracting      information from them in order to execute a research query. METHOD: There is      limited pre-existing work on the generic specification of clinical queries. Sets       of example queries were obtained from published studies and clinician reference      groups. These were re-represented as structured logical expressions, from which a      generalisable pattern (information model) was inferred. An iterative design and      implementation approach was then pursued to refine the model and evaluate it.      RESULTS: This paper presents a set of requirements for the generic representation      of clinical research queries, and an information model to represent any arbitrary      such query. A middleware component was implemented as an interface to an existing      system that holds 20,000 anonymised cancer EHRs in order to validate the model.      This component was interfaced in turn to a query design and results presentation       tool developed by the Open University, to permit end user demonstrations and      feedback as part of the evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although it is difficult to      separate cleanly the evaluation of a theoretical model from its implementation,      the empirical evaluation of the query-execution interface revealed that clinical       queries of the kinds studied could all be represented and executed successfully.       However, performance was a problem and this paper outlines some of the challenges      faced in building generic components to handle specialised data structures on a      large scale. The limitations of this work are also discussed. The work      complements many years of European research and standardisation on the      interoperable communication of electronic health records, by proposing a way in      which one or more EHR systems might be queried in a standardised way.

PMID- 18603470   - OBJECTIVE: This study presents a conceptual model to investigate the healthcare      technology management (HTM) competency required by healthcare IS professionals      and the impact of such competency in gaining strategic advantages through      information technology (IT) by development of partnerships with people from      different divisions of healthcare organizations. METHODS: First, a scale to      measure HTM competency was developed and validated, then it was used to collect      the large-scale survey data. Second, the partial least squares (PLS) method was      used to empirically test the conceptual model and hypotheses through the      large-scale survey data collected. RESULTS: The empirical results support the      proposed structure for HTM competency encompassing the four skills/knowledge      domains: healthcare organization overview, external knowledge networking,      healthcare technology integration, and management and interpersonal. The findings      indicate that HTM competency positively influences the attitudes of information      system (IS) professionals towards their willingness to develop partnerships with       healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings improve our understanding of       the concept of HTM competency and its influence on IT-healthcare partnerships.      The conceptual model of HTM is of particular value to those concerned with      skills/knowledge training and competency development for IS professionals in      healthcare organizations. Healthcare organizations can develop HTM profiles for     individual IS professionals in accordance with their own organization contexts.      Executive management can take advantage of such HTM profiles to assist in making       succession-planning decisions by evaluating the competency levels and development      needs of their employees.

PMID- 18599342   - OBJECTIVE: The problem list is a key and required element of the electronic      medical record (EMR). Problem lists may contribute substantially to patient      safety and quality of care. Physician documentation of the problem list is often       lower than desired. Methods are needed to improve accuracy and completeness of      the problem list. DESIGN: An automated clinical decision support (CDS)      intervention was designed utilizing a commercially available EMR with      computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and CDS. The system was based on alerts      delivered during inpatient medication CPOE that prompted clinicians to add a      diagnosis to the problem list. Each alert was studied for a 2-month period after       implementation. MEASUREMENTS: Measures included alert validity, alert yield, and       accuracy of problem list additions. RESULTS: At a 450 bed teaching hospital, the       number of medication orders which triggered alerts during all 2-month study      periods was 1011. For all the alerts, the likelihood of a valid alert (an alert      that occurred in patients with one of the predefined diagnoses) was 96+/-1%. The       alert yield, defined as occuring when an alert led to addition of a problem to      the problem list, was 76+/-2%. Accurate problem list additions, defined as      additions of problems when the problem was determined to be present by expert      review, was 95+/-1%. CONCLUSION: The CDS problem list mechanism was integrated      into the process of medication order placement and promoted relatively accurate      addition of problems to the EMR problem list.

PMID- 18586556   - BACKGROUND: Re-use of patient data from an electronic patient record heavily      relies on structured, coded data. Terminological systems (TSs) are meant to      support this. TSs are more commonly implemented nowadays, especially those that      support post-coordination. The effect of using a compositional TS on correctness       and specificity of captured patient data is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the      agreement between free-text reasons for admission to intensive care captured in a      patient data management system (PDMS) and reasons for admission that were      recorded using a compositional TS embedded in the PDMS. METHODS: Observational      study comparing pairs of free-text reasons for admission to intensive care with      reasons for admission that were recorded using a compositional TS. Both reasons      for admission were captured in the PDMS by clinicians during regular care      practice. Each pair was judged as exact match, partial match or mismatch by two      independent raters. Partial matches were further analyzed to investigate whether       free-text or TS-based reasons for admissions included more detail and whether     these differences could be explained by the content, the interface of the TS or     by user or usability characteristics. RESULTS: Eleven percent of the pairs      matched exactly, 79% of the pairs matched partially and 10% of the pairs did not       match. Compared to free-text registration TS-based registration resulted in more       detail for 21% of the partial matches, in less detail for 43% of the partial      matches and in 36% of the partial matches some detail was added while at the same      time other detail was lacking. In 65% of the cases in which the TS-based      registration lacked some detail, this detail was available in the content of the       TS. Physicians who used the TS occasionally had a significantly higher percentage      of mismatches. CONCLUSION: In practice, post-coordination leads to information      with different detail but a level of detail comparable to free-text registration       of reasons for admission. Details missing in the TS-based reasons for admission      were most often available in the TS, indicating that user interaction with the      system is more of an impediment than the contents of the TS.

PMID- 18579436   - BACKGROUND: The ideal scenario for information technology to bridge information      gaps between primary and secondary healthcare and to improve the quality of      healthcare in the medication process is to build an interoperable communication      network. This type of undertaking requires diverse information systems to be      integrated, and central to this are the preservation of data integrity and the      integration of different pieces of patient data. OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY: In      this study, we focused on sources of challenges to the integration process and to      the building of an interoperable communication network. Interviews, document      analysis, and observations were conducted to evaluate the integration process in       a project that involved medication data communication between primary healthcare       providers (i.e., general practitioners and community pharmacists) and secondary      healthcare providers (i.e., hospital pharmacists and specialist physicians).      RESULTS: The project encountered numerous integration problems, many of which      persisted even after extensive technical intervention. An analysis of the      problems revealed that they were mostly rooted either in problematic integration       of work processes or in the way the system was used. Despite the project's ideal       technical condition, the integration could be accomplished only by applying human      interfaces. CONCLUSION: The main challenge to building interoperable      communication network does not lie in technical integration. The real problem      occurs when the technical linkage is implemented without the work processes being      aligned and integrated.

PMID- 18565788   - BACKGROUND: Electronic clinical knowledge support systems have decreased barriers      to answering clinical questions but there is little evidence as to whether they      have an impact on health outcomes. METHODS: We compared hospitals with online      access to UpToDate with other acute care hospitals included in the Thomson 100      Top Hospitals Database (Thomson database). Metrics used in the Thomson database      differentiate hospitals on a variety of performance dimensions such as quality      and efficiency. Prespecified outcomes were risk-adjusted mortality,      complications, the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety      Indicators, and hospital length of stay among Medicare beneficiaries. Linear     regression models were developed that included adjustment for hospital region,      teaching status, and discharge volume. RESULTS: Hospitals with access to UpToDate      (n=424) were associated with significantly better performance than other     hospitals in the Thomson database (n=3091) on risk-adjusted measures of patient      safety (P=0.0163) and complications (P=0.0012) and had significantly shorter     length of stay (by on average 0.167 days per discharge, 95% confidence interval      0.081-0.252 days, P<0.0001). All of these associations correlated significantly      with how much UpToDate was used at each hospital. Mortality was not significantly      different between UpToDate and non-UpToDate hospitals. LIMITATIONS: The study was      retrospective and observational and could not fully account for additional      features at the included hospitals that may also have been associated with better     health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: An electronic clinical knowledge support system      (UpToDate was associated with improved health outcomes and shorter length of stay      among Medicare beneficiaries in acute care hospitals in the United States.      Additional studies are needed to clarify whether use of UpToDate is a marker for       the better performance, an independent cause of it, or a synergistic part of      other quality improvement characteristics at better-performing hospitals.

PMID- 18514021   - PURPOSE: This paper explores the constituents of and challenges related to the      innovation of technology-based services in the long-term homecare sector.      METHODS: This research used purposeful extreme case sampling, a mixed methods      approach to research that included focus groups and interviews, to learn from the      experiences of an innovative telehomecare project. The paper uses a framework      that integrates service management; information systems innovation and medical      informatics theory. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the claimed and the      rather abstract benefits of the technology espoused by information technology      vendors were difficult to transform into a service concept. The organization      studied is still struggling with conflicts between technological possibilities on      the one hand, and the prevailing service delivery systems and user preferences on      the other. Decisions about the extent to which the service needs to be      reengineered, what non-technology resources are required, what should be the role      of the consumer in the new care process and identifying who is actually the      primary beneficiary and user of the new service remain. CONCLUSIONS: A      comprehensive development model and 'mindfulness' is necessary for radical      service innovation in the long-term homecare sector. Creating new services that      exploit the capability of radical technical innovations requires organizational      development and the use of many non-technology innovations and resources. To      understand what combinations of technological and non-technological resources can      provide sustainable benefit, all key internal and external stakeholders must be      involved from the beginning of the project.

PMID- 18514020   - BACKGROUND: Due to their efficiency and safety potential, computerized physician       order entry (CPOE) systems are gaining considerable attention in in-patient      settings. However, recent studies have shown that these systems may undermine the      efficiency and safety of the medication process by impeding nurse-physician      collaboration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a CPOE system on the      mechanisms whereby nurses and physicians maintain their collaboration in the      medication process. SETTING AND METHODOLOGY: Six internal medicine wards at the      Erasmus Medical Centre were included in this study. A questionnaire was used to      record nurses' attitudes towards the effectiveness of the former paper-based      system. A similar questionnaire was used to evaluate nurses' attitudes with      respect to a CPOE system that replaced the paper-based system. The data were      complemented and triangulated through interviews with physicians and nurses.      RESULTS: Response rates for the analyzed questions in the pre- and      post-implementation questionnaires were 54.3% (76/140) and 52.14% (73/140). The      CPOE system had a mixed impact on medication work: while it improved the main      non-supportive features of the paper-based system, it lacked its main supportive       features. The interviews revealed more detailed supportive and non-supportive      features of the two systems. A comparison of supportive features of the      paper-based system with non-supportive features of the CPOE system showed that      synchronisation and feedback mechanisms in nurse-physician collaborations have      been impaired after the CPOE system was introduced. CONCLUSION: This study      contributes to an understanding of the affected mechanisms in nurse-physician      collaboration using a CPOE system. It provides recommendations for repairing the       impaired mechanisms and for redesigning the CPOE system and thus for better     supporting these structures.

PMID- 18457988   - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the post-implementation impact of a nursing      information system and identified issues related to the technology adoption      process. Given the high level of investment necessary to implement information      systems, evaluation has become vital to ensure successful adoption and use.      Improved understanding of implementation difficulties/barriers and factors      leading to them can serve as a platform for the development of strategies and      education programs for users. METHOD: The study design was a two-stage data      comparison analysis of a nursing information system focusing on computerized      nursing care plan use. Data were collected from nurses by questionnaire during      the first month (December 2004) and 1 year after system installation (December     2005). RESULTS: While nurses gave the information technology a higher evaluation       score at the second stage than at the early stage, the overall ratings were      slightly negative at both stages. Age and pressure to use the system were      critical factors at both stages, whereas computer skills and perceived time using      the system were vital at the beginning stage of implementation. Issues of concern      at both stages were system functionality, efficiency, usability, and user     support. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an information system requires      consideration of issues involving hardware and software, staff training,      organizational policy, and workflow changes.

PMID- 18457987   - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of a fully functional electronic patient      record (EPR) system on clinicians' work during team conferences, ward rounds, and      nursing handovers. METHOD: In collaboration with clinicians an EPR system was      configured for a stroke unit and in trial use for 5 days, 24h a day. During the      trial period the EPR system was used by all clinicians at the stroke unit and it       replaced all paper records. The EPR system simulated a fully integrated      clinical-process EPR where the clinicians experienced the system as if all      transactions were IT supported. Such systems are not to be expected to be in      operational use in Denmark until at least 2 years from now. The EPR system was      evaluated with respect to its effects on clinicians' mental workload, overview,      and need for exchanging information. Effects were measured by comparing the use      of electronic records with the use of paper records prior to the trial period.      The data comprise measurements from 11 team conferences, 7 ward rounds, and 10      nursing handovers. RESULTS: During team conferences the clinicians experienced a       reduction on five of six subscales of mental workload, and the physicians      experienced an overall reduction in mental workload. The physician in charge also      experienced increased clarity about the importance of and responsibilities for     work tasks, and reduced mental workload during ward rounds. During nursing      handovers the nurses experienced fewer missing pieces of information and fewer     messages to pass on after the handover. Further, the status of the nursing plans       for each patient was clearer for all nurses at the nursing handovers except the      nurse team leader, who experienced less clarity about the status of the plans.      CONCLUSION: The clinicians experienced positive effects of electronic records      over paper records for the three clinical activities involved in the evaluation.       This is important in its own right and likely to affect clinicians' acceptance of      EPR systems, their command of their work, and consequently the attainment of      'downstream' effects on patient outcomes.

PMID- 18448385   - PURPOSE: The present study reports the current status of computerizing medical      records in Japan. In 2001, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare formulated       the Grand Design for the Development of Information Systems in the Healthcare and      Medical Fields. The Grand Design stated a numerical target for "spreading the use      of electronic medical records (EMR) in at least 60% of Japan's hospitals with 400      or more beds by 2006." The objective of this study was to examine the extent to      which EMR and order entry systems (OES) have been adopted as of February 2007 and      to evaluate the Japanese government's policy regarding the computerization of      medical records. METHODS: We conducted a postal survey targeting medical      institutions throughout Japan. In February 2007, we mailed self-administered      questionnaires to all 1574 hospitals with 300 or more beds, and to a random      selection of 1000 hospitals with less than 300 beds in addition to 4000 clinics.       Responses were received from 812 (51.6%), 504 (50.5%), and 1769 (44.8%),      respectively. We asked questions concerning: (i) the extent to which EMR and OES       had been introduced; (ii) the reasons why certain institutions had not introduced      EMR and (iii) the subjective evaluation of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of      EMR. RESULTS: The percentage of institutions that had introduced EMR as of      February 2007 was 10.0% for hospitals and 10.1% for clinics. Even the percentage       for hospitals with 400 or more beds was just 31.2%, illustrating that the      government's target had not been reached. The most common reason given for not      introducing EMR was: "The cost is high" which was observed in 82.0% of hospitals.      It was considered that the introduction of EMR could improve 'inter-hospital      networks', and 'time efficiency for physicians' by around 45% and 25% of      hospitals, respectively. CONCLUSION: Healthcare information computerization in      Japan is behind schedule because the introductory costs are high. For the      computerization of healthcare information to be further promoted, prices of EMR     systems should be lowered to a level which individual hospitals can afford.      Furthermore, the communication between EMR systems should be further standardized      to secure functional and semantic interoperability in Japan.

PMID- 18440270   - OBJECTIVE: The Health Risk Reminders and Surveillance (HRRS) system was designed       to deliver critical abnormal test results of severely ill patients from      Laboratory, Radiology, and Pathology departments to physicians within 5 min using      cell phone text messages. This paper explores the success of the HRRS system.      METHOD: This study employed an augmented version of the DeLone and McLean IS      success model. Seven variables (system quality, information quality, system use,       user satisfaction, mobile healthcare anxiety, impact on the individual and impact      on the organization) were used to evaluate the success of the HRRS system. The      interrelationships between the seven variables were hypothesized and the      hypotheses were empirically tested. RESULTS: The results indicate that the      information quality of the HRRS system is positively associated with both system       use and user satisfaction. In addition, system use is positively associated with       user satisfaction, which is also positively associated with mobile healthcare      anxiety. Moreover, results indicate that impact on the individual is positively      associated with both user satisfaction and mobile healthcare anxiety. Finally,      the impact of the organization is positively associated with impact on the      individual. CONCLUSION: The results of the study provide an expanded      understanding of the factors that contribute to mobile patient safety information      system (IS) success. Implications of the relationship between system use and      physician mobile healthcare anxiety are discussed.

PMID- 18434246   - OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to      explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health      information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of      2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information      on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the      determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four     classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user     satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales      were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided      compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory      factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the      theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the      variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors:      perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health      information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of      physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the      information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the      importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as       a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the      potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal      knowledge of health issues.

PMID- 18417417   - PURPOSE: This study examines tailored feedback letters of a smoking cessation      intervention that is conceptually based on the transtheoretical model, from a      content-based perspective. METHODS: Data of 2 population-based intervention      studies, both randomized controlled trials, with total N=1044 were used. The      procedure of the intervention, the tailoring principle for the feedback letters,       and the content of the intervention materials are described in detail.      Theoretical and empirical frequencies of unique feedback letters are presented.      RESULTS: The intervention system was able to generate a total of 1040 unique      letters with normative feedback only, and almost half a million unique letters      with normative and ipsative feedback. Almost every single smoker in      contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance had an empirically unique      combination of tailoring variables and received a unique letter. In contrast,      many smokers in precontemplation shared a combination of tailoring variables and       received identical letters. CONCLUSION: The transtheoretical model provides an      enormous theoretical and empirical variability of tailoring. However, tailoring      for a major subgroup of smokers, i.e. those who do not intend to quit, needs      improvement. Conceptual ideas for additional tailoring variables are discussed.

PMID- 18353713   - BACKGROUND: A large body of evidence over many years suggests that clinical      decision support systems can be helpful in improving both clinical outcomes and      adherence to evidence-based guidelines. However, to this day, clinical decision      support systems are not widely used outside of a small number of sites. One      reason why decision support systems are not widely used is the relative      difficulty of integrating such systems into clinical workflows and computer     systems. PURPOSE: To review and synthesize the history of clinical decision      support systems, and to propose a model of various architectures for integrating       clinical decision support systems with clinical systems. METHODS: The authors      conducted an extensive review of the clinical decision support literature since      1959, sequenced the systems and developed a model. RESULTS: The model developed      consists of four phases: standalone decision support systems, decision support      integrated into clinical systems, standards for sharing clinical decision support      content and service models for decision support. These four phases have not      heretofore been identified, but they track remarkably well with the chronological      history of clinical decision support, and show evolving and increasingly      sophisticated attempts to ease integrating decision support systems into clinical      workflows and other clinical systems. CONCLUSIONS: Each of the four evolutionary       approaches to decision support architecture has unique advantages and      disadvantages. A key lesson was that there were common limitations that almost      all the approaches faced, and no single approach has been able to entirely      surmount: (1) fixed knowledge representation systems inherently circumscribe the       type of knowledge that can be represented in them, (2) there are serious      terminological issues, (3) patient data may be spread across several sources with      no single source having a complete view of the patient, and (4) major     difficulties exist in transferring successful interventions from one site to      another.

PMID- 18342569   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of introducing the      Dental 3D Multimedia (D3DM) System on dentist-patient interactions. DESIGN: An      initial version of the D3DM developed in a series of researches was applied to      the current study. A longitudinal pre-post study was setup: volunteer patients      answered questionnaires at three differing intervals during the course of the      study: before the introduction of the D3DM during the first visit, after the      introduction of the D3DM during the first visit, and after the introduction of      the D3DM during the second visit. The questionnaires related to patient      satisfaction and covered three main areas of interests: (1) satisfaction with      visit components, (2) comprehension about dental issues, and (3) perceptions with      regard to dental office computing. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, patient      overall satisfaction increased significantly both immediately after the      introduction of the D3DM and at the second visit. Patient's satisfaction with      dentist's familiarity with them, and satisfaction with dental issues generally      increased. On measures of psychological communication and available time,      patients generally reported that no changes occurred during visits. A majority of      participants reported that they preferred the D3DM more than traditional      dentist-patient communication patterns. There were no significant changes in      patient perceptions of the computer use over time. CONCLUSIONS: the D3DM appeared      to have positive effects on dentist-patient communications, improving the mutual       understanding between them. There were no significant negative effects directly      generated from the computer intervention. Further research is needed to update      the current D3DM and investigate how the system might be best implemented in the       dental office environment.

PMID- 18321775   - PURPOSE: A new model expressing Arden Syntax with the eXtensible Markup Language       (XML) was developed to increase its portability. METHODS: Every example was      manually parsed and reviewed until the schema and the style sheet were considered      to be optimized. When the first schema was finished, several MLMs in Arden Syntax      Markup Language (ArdenML) were validated against the schema. They were then      transformed to HTML formats with the style sheet, during which they were compared      to the original text version of their own MLM. When faults were found in the      transformed MLM, the schema and/or style sheet was fixed. This cycle continued      until all the examples were encoded into XML documents. The original MLMs were      encoded in XML according to the proposed XML schema and reverse-parsed MLMs in      ArdenML were checked using a public domain Arden Syntax checker. RESULTS: Two      hundred seventy seven examples of MLMs were successfully transformed into XML      documents using the model, and the reverse-parse yielded the original text      version of MLMs. Two hundred sixty five of the 277 MLMs showed the same error     patterns before and after transformation, and all 11 errors related to statement       structure were resolved in XML version. The model uses two syntax checking      mechanisms, first an XML validation process, and second, a syntax check using an       XSL style sheet. CONCLUSION: Now that we have a schema for ArdenML, we can also      begin the development of style sheets for transformation ArdenML into other     languages.

PMID- 18313352   - INTRODUCTION: Many hospitals are currently in the process of developing and      implementing electronic medical records (EMR) systems. This is a critical time      for developing a framework that can measure and allow for comparison the      effectiveness of EMR systems across hospitals that have implemented these      systems. The motivation for this study comes from the realization that there is      limited research on the understanding of the effectiveness of EMR systems, and a       lack of appropriate reference theoretical framework for measuring the      effectiveness of EMR systems. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework      for generating a composite index (CI) for measuring the effectiveness of EMR     systems in hospitals. METHODS: Data used to test the framework and associated      research objectives were derived from a cross-sectional survey of five      stakeholders of EMR systems including chief medical officers, chief nursing      officers, chief information officers, doctors and nurses in 20 Japanese      hospitals. Using statistical means of standardization and principal component      analysis (PCA) procedure, CI was developed by summing up the scores of four     dimensions-system quality, information quality, use and user satisfaction. The      process included formulating items for each dimension, condensing the data into      factors relevant to the dimension and calculating the CI by summing up the      product of each dimension with its respective principal component score      coefficient. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha for the four dimensions used in      developing CI was .843. Validation of CI revealed that it was correlated to      internal dimensions (system quality, R=.828; information quality, R=.909; use,      R=.969; and user satisfaction, R=.679) and to external factors (JAHIS level,      R=.832 and patient safety culture, R=.585). These results suggest that CI could      be a reliable and valid measure of the effectiveness of EMR systems in the      responding hospitals. On benchmarking of hospitals, 30.0% (6/20) of the      responding hospitals performed less than satisfactory on CI and that majority of       the hospitals performed poorly on user satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: CI has provided      a standard way, through quantitative means, of measuring, comparing and      categorizing the effectiveness of EMR systems in hospitals. CI can be a powerful       tool for benchmarking the effectiveness of EMR systems in hospitals in ways that       can guide hospitals in computerization process as well as benchmark their systems      against other hospitals.

PMID- 18294904   - BACKGROUND: Hospital discharge summaries have traditionally been paper-based      (handwritten or dictated), and deficiencies have often been reported. On the      increase is the utilisation of electronic summaries, which are considered of      higher quality than paper-based summaries. However, comparisons between      electronic and paper-based summaries regarding documentation deficiencies have      rarely been made and there have been none in recent years. OBJECTIVES: (1) To      study the hospital discharge summaries, which were either handwritten or     electronic, of a population of inpatients, with regard to documentation of      information required for ongoing care; and (2) to compare the electronic with the      handwritten summaries concerning documentation of this information. METHODS: The       discharge summaries of 245 inpatients were examined for documentation of the      items: discharge date; additional diagnoses; summary of the patient's progress in      hospital; investigations; discharge medications; and follow-up (instructions to      the patient's general practitioner). One hundred and fifty-one (62%) discharge      summaries were electronically created and 94 (38%) were handwritten. Odds ratios       (ORs) with their confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to show strength of      association between the electronic summary and documentation of individual study       items. RESULTS: Across all items studied, the electronic summaries contained a      higher number of errors and/or omissions than the handwritten ones (OR 1.74, 95%       CI 1.26-2.39, p<0.05). Electronic summaries more commonly documented a summary of      the patient's progress in hospital (OR 18.3, 95% CI 3.33-100, p<0.05) and less      commonly recorded date of discharge and additional diagnoses (respective ORs 0.17      (95% CI 0.09-0.31, p<0.05) and 0.33 (95% CI 0.15-0.89, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: It is      not necessarily the case that electronic discharge summaries are of higher     quality than handwritten ones, but free text items such as summary of the      patient's progress may less likely be omitted in electronic summaries. It is      unknown what factors contributed to incompleteness in creating the electronic      discharge summaries investigated in this study. Possible causes for deficiencies       include: insufficient training; insufficient education of, and thus realisation      by, doctors regarding the importance of accurate, complete discharge summaries;      inadequate computer literacy; inadequate user interaction design, and      insufficient integration into routine work processes. Research into these factors      is recommended. This study suggests that not enough care is taken by doctors when      creating discharge summaries, and that this is independent of the type of method       used. The importance of the discharge summary as a chief means of transferring      patient information from the hospital to the primary care provider needs to be      strongly emphasised.

PMID- 18280787   - PURPOSE: To improve the completeness and timeliness of an electronic problem      list, we have developed a system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to      automatically extract potential medical problems from clinical, free-text      documents; these problems are then proposed for inclusion in an electronic      problem list management application. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled      evaluation of the Automatic Problem List (APL) system in an intensive care unit      and in a cardiovascular surgery unit is reported here. A total of 247 patients      were enrolled: 76 in an initial control phase and 171 in the randomized      controlled trial that followed. During this latter phase, patients were randomly       assigned to a control or an intervention group. All patients had their documents       analyzed by the system, but the medical problems discovered were only proposed in      the problem list for intervention patients. We measured the sensitivity,      specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and the      timeliness of the problem lists. RESULTS: Our system significantly increased the       sensitivity of the problem lists in the intensive care unit, from about 9% to      41%, and even 77% if problems automatically proposed but not acknowledged by      users were also considered. Timeliness of addition of problems to the list was      greatly improved, with a time between a problem's first mention in a clinical      document and its addition to the problem list reduced from about 6 days to less      than 2 days. No significant effect was observed in the cardiovascular surgery      unit.

PMID- 18248847   - OBJECTIVE: It is widely accepted that the development of electronic patient      records, or even of a common electronic patient record, is one possible way to      improve cooperation and data communication between nurses and physicians. Yet,      little has been done so far to develop a common conceptual model for both medical      and nursing patient records, which is a first challenge that should be met to set      up a common electronic patient record. In this paper, we describe a      problem-oriented conceptual model and we show how it may suit both nursing and      medical perspectives in a hospital setting. METHODS: We started from existing      nursing theory and from an initial model previously set up for primary care. In a      hospital pilot site, a multi-disciplinary team refined this model using one large      and complex clinical case (retrospective study) and nine ongoing cases      (prospective study). An internal validation was performed through hospital-wide      multi-professional interviews and through discussions around a graphical user     interface prototype. To assess the consistency of the model, a computer engineer       specified it. Finally, a Belgian expert working group performed an external      assessment of the model. RESULTS: As a basis for a common patient record we      propose a simple problem-oriented conceptual model with two levels of      meta-information. The model is mapped with current nursing theories and it      includes the following concepts: "health care element", "health approach",      "health agent", "contact", "subcontact" and "service". These concepts, their     interrelationships and some practical rules for using the model are illustrated      in this paper. Our results are compatible with ongoing standardization work at      the Belgian and European levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our conceptual model is potentially      a foundation for a multi-professional electronic patient record that is      problem-oriented and therefore patient-centred.

PMID- 18248846   - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological shifts, financial pressures and changing policy      priorities in healthcare initiate reflections on innovative ways to deliver care.      Technologies offer opportunities to change health services delivery. One of the      emerging fields is telehomecare-applications. Yet, these applications are not      always adapted to the user needs and characteristics of the homecare setting,      resulting in "system failure". OBJECTIVES: We describe a generic methodological      model to incorporate user perspectives in the design and development process of      e-health systems. The model aims at grounding the choice of the technology in a      clear understanding of the homecare field, and on interactive reflections with      the technology developers. METHODS AND RESULTS: The methodological model develops      over three phases. A first phase aims to identify and to select potential patient      groups for which the technology will be developed: It holds (a) gathering of      epidemiological data; (b) identifying relevant inclusion criteria to select      patient groups; (c) qualitative weighting based on the inclusion criteria to      include potential patient groups and (d) plenary discussion with the technology      developers. In a second phase, the particular needs of the selected patient      groups are assessed through literature review, document analysis and explorative       interviews with key informants. In the third phase, "social" use cases are      developed in which the use of potential technologies is written as virtual      storylines. The writing of the use cases is prepared through a semi-structured      questionnaire for all partners listing the "visions and expectations on the      technology and user context". The use cases are the source documents for a      plenary discussion with the technology developers in which priorities are set for     functionalities of the e-homecare platform. The methodological approach is      illustrated within the Coplintho-project. It is a Flemish initiative developing      an e-homecare platform offering a package of services on a dedicated device to      support the social integration and 'independent living' of people in their home      environment. DISCUSSION: Our methodological approach provides a practical      framework for understanding and considering user perspectives. The application of      the method within the development of the Coplintho-e-homecare platform      demonstrated its usefulness. The experience within the Coplintho-pilot project      learned important lessons about the operational use of the method. The      methodology is time-consuming and requires scientific input to assess and to      document potential user needs, requiring specific means and human resources. The       method also requires a very explicit project management of the preparatory phase.

PMID- 18242123   - OBJECTIVES: This paper investigates the potential for a standardised electronic      health record (EHR) designed for conventional medicine also to be used by      complementary and alternative medicine. METHOD: The research was undertaken using      anonymised samples of patient records from homoeopathy practices, to investigate       if the patient data could be modelled using the forthcoming joint European and      International Standard for EHR Communications (ISO/EN 13606). The research      deliberately did not consider the effectiveness of complementary and alternative       medicine or the clinical evidence for any particular CAM practice or treatment.      The focus was purely on the patient data captured routinely by CAM therapists, to      determine whether current approaches to the representation and communication of      EHRs could incorporate such records. RESULTS: Five homoeopathic patient records,       authored by different practitioners in different practice settings, were      re-represented in a structured form in conformance with the ISO/EN 13606      reference Model. A sixth practitioner confirmed that the transposition had been      as faithful to the original records as was possible given some limitations in the      clarity of the originals. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that the ISO/EN 13606       model can be used to represent patient records from homoeopathy, including the      evidence and reasoning used to arrive at a formulation and to determine the      appropriate remedy. It is therefore feasible that future EHR systems adopting      this standard could enable patient records to be shared between complementary and      conventional medical practice, in support of integrated healthcare.

PMID- 18182321   - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that patients are being prescribed a significant       number of duplicated prescriptions despite the use of computerized safety      reminder systems. Nonetheless, the physicians' behavior with respect to the      computer reminders has not been well studied as yet. This problem is important      because drug duplication can result in patient overdose with unpredictable or     undesirable effects; furthermore, it is also a waste of significant healthcare      resources. METHODS: In 2005, a computerized drug-duplication reminder system on      the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) was implemented at a 737-bed      teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. The log file, combined with the physicians'      profiles, was statistically examined using the Mantel-Haenszel technique over the      second half of 2005. RESULTS: A total of 11,298 orders (1.26%) involved      drug-duplication reminders and this was out of 896,131 orders in 188,182 order     set during the study period. The physicians related variables (workload,      department, educational background, years in practice at the target hospital and       age), policy related variables (intervention from the insurer and hospital      administration), the order itself (drug price and medication class) and patients'      resistance were found to be most critically related to physicians' behaviors in      terms of the reminders. Intervention by Taiwan's National Insurance reimbursement      policy appeared to be ineffective as a way of affecting the physicians' behavior.      CONCLUSION: The log file appears to be a valuable source for analyzing      physicians' behavior on reminders if well designed with the CPOE. Hospitals,      clinicians and patients should pay more attention and be seriously concerned      about CPOE reminders. It is also important to reexamine the physicians' workload       and the insurer reimbursement policy in relation to drug duplication.

PMID- 18178520   - PURPOSE: Collecting and analyzing findings constitute the basis of medical      activity. Computer assisted medical activity raises the problem of modelling      findings. We propose a unified representation of findings integrating the      representations of findings in the GAMUTS in Radiology [M.M. Reeder, B. Felson,      GAMUTS in radiology Comprehensive lists of roentgen differential diagnosis,      fourth ed., 2003], the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and the Digital      Imaging and Communication in Medicine Structured Report (DICOM-SR). MATERIALS AND      METHODS: Starting from a corpus of findings in bone and joint radiology [M.M.      Reeder, B. Felson, GAMUTS in Radiology comprehensive lists of roentgen      differential diagnosis, fourth ed., 2003] (3481 words), an automated mapping to      the UMLS was performed with the Metamap Program. The resulting UMLS terms and      Semantic Types were analyzed in order to find a generic template in accordance      with DICOM-SR structure. RESULTS: UMLS Concepts were missing for 45% of the      GAMUTS findings. Three kinds of regularities were observed in the way the      Semantic Types were combined: "pathological findings", "physiological findings"      and "anatomical findings". A generic and original DICOM-SR template modelling      finding was proposed. It was evaluated for representing GAMUTS jaws findings. 21%      missing terms had to be picked up from Radlex (5%) or created (16%).      DISCUSSION-CONCLUSION: This article shows that it is possible to represent      findings using the UMLS and the DICOM SR formalism with a semi-automated method.       The Metamap program helped to find a model to represent the semantic structure of      free texts with standardized terms (UMLS Concepts). Nevertheless, the coverage of      the UMLS is not comprehensive. This study shows that the UMLS should include more      technical concepts and more concepts regarding findings, signs and symptoms to be      suitable for radiology representation. The semi-automated translation of the      whole GAMUTS using the UMLS concepts and the DICOM SR relations could help to      create or supplement the DCMR Templates and Context Groups pertaining to the      description of imaging findings.

PMID- 18068427   - OBJECTIVES: This article presents a novel approach based on computer-aided      diagnostic (CAD) scheme and wavelet transforms to aid pneumonia diagnosis in      children, using chest radiograph images. The prototype system, named Pneumo-CAD,       was designed to classify images into presence (PP) or absence of pneumonia (PA).       MATERIALS AND METHODS: The knowledge database for the Pneumo-CAD comprised chest       images confirmed as PP or PA by two radiologists trained to interpret chest      radiographs according to the WHO guidelines for the diagnosis of pneumonia in      children. The performance of the Pneumo-CAD was evaluated by a subset of images      randomly selected from the knowledge database. The retrieval of similar images      was made by feature extraction using wavelets transform coefficients of the      image. The energy of the wavelet coefficients was used to compose the feature      vector in order to support the computational classification of images as PP or     PA. Methodology I worked with a rank-weighted 15-nearest-neighbour scheme, while       methodology II employed a distance-dependent weighting for image classification.       The performance of the prototype system was assessed by the ROC curve. RESULTS:      Overall, the Pneumo-CAD using the Haar wavelet presented the best accuracy in      discriminating PP from PA for both, methodology I (AUC=0.97) and methodology II      (AUC=0.94), reaching sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80% and 90%,      respectively. CONCLUSION: Pneumo-CAD could represent a complementary tool to      screen children with clinical suspicion of pneumonia, and so to contribute to      gather information on the burden of-pneumonia estimates in order to help guide      health policies toward preventive interventions.

PMID- 18061536   - BACKGROUND: Problems of communication are an important barrier on the pathway to       healthcare for patients with limited or no ability in the majority language of      the country in which they live. Solutions involving interpreters who have to be      booked in advance, or using unqualified friends or family members to translate,      are highly unsatisfactory. AIM: This paper describes a computer-based approach to      alleviating the situation. DESIGN/METHOD: A computer-based communication aid was       developed and tested. The communication aid is designed to permit an      English-speaking healthcare practitioner to select a series of questions which      are then presented along with a range of possible answers for the patient to      choose from. The questions and answers are presented in the patient's own      language in both text and digitised speech accompanied by symbols as well as      English text. As a test-case we focused on Somali patients with asthma. RESULTS:       26 simulated consultations with Somali asthma sufferers and healthcare      practitioners (three GPs and six nurses) with experience of asthma treatment with      this patient group were held with the system implemented either on a laptop with       mouse pad, or a tablet with stylus. All the consultations were successfully      completed with a high satisfaction rate on the part of both practitioners and      patients. CONCLUSION: Feedback questionnaires suggest some areas for improvement.      The proposed system is a practical way of addressing the problem of communication      with patients with limited English in the context of clinician-led      question-answer dialogues.

PMID- 18060833   - OBJECTIVE: Exploring solutions for infectious disease information sharing among      hospital and public health information systems is imperative to the improvement      of disease surveillance and emergent response. This paper aimed at developing a      method to directly transmit real-time data of notifiable infectious diseases from      hospital information systems to public health information systems on the Internet      by using a standard eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format. METHODS: The      mechanism and work flow by which notifiable infectious disease data are created,       reported and used at health agencies in China was evaluated. The capacity of all       participating providers to use electronic data interchange to submit transactions      of data required for the notifiable infectious disease reporting was assessed.      The minimum data set at national level that is required for reporting for     national notifiable infectious disease surveillance was determined. The standards      and techniques available worldwide for electronic health data interchange, such      as XML, HL7 messaging, CDA and ATSM CCR, etc. were reviewed and compared, and an       XML implementation format needed for this purpose was defined for hospitals that       are able to access the Internet to provide a complete infectious disease      reporting. RESULTS: There are 18,703 county or city hospitals in China. All of      them have access to basic information infrastructures including computers, e-mail      and the Internet. Nearly 10,000 hospitals possess hospital information systems      used for electronically recording, retrieving and manipulating patients'      information. These systems collect 23 data items required in the minimum data set      for national notifiable infectious disease reporting. In order to transmit these       data items to the disease surveillance system and local health information      systems instantly and without duplication of data input, an XML schema and a set       of standard data elements were developed to define the content, structure and      semantics of the data set. These standards make it possible to view and analyse      the data accurately outside the hospital information systems in many different      document formats. The paper also identified other issues involved in notifiable      disease reporting in the future, such as the adoption of approved vocabulary      standards and implementation problems such as the route, secure transfer,      parsing, and objective identifying of the XML message. CONCLUSIONS: XML is an      increasingly important standard for exchange and transmission of data between      disparate applications and systems. As in its early stages of developing an      interoperable health information system in China, the XML document structures      could be a way to exchange the notifiable case information among interest parties      on the web at present.

PMID- 18054275   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of a natural CPOE implementation in a hospital      setting and inform the efficacy of using CPOE rather than traditional paper     medication orders. DESIGN: A multiple-baseline, quasi-experimental study of a      naturally occurring CPOE intervention, with a non-equivalent control site.      MEASUREMENTS: Compliance with medication-ordering protocols and time to first      dose of antibiotics. RESULTS: Medication orders placed using CPOE were      significantly more compliant than paper-based medication orders, and first doses       of antibiotics were delivered significantly faster when ordered with CPOE than      when placed using the standard paper-based system (p<.01). CONCLUSION: Findings      support the use of CPOE and justify the need for interventions to increase CPOE      adoption and consistent use among physicians.

PMID- 18053762   - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is four-fold. First, the hospitals' current      level of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) adoption is reported; second,       internal and external influence factors' roles in determining CPOE adoption rates      are described; third, the future diffusion rate of CPOE systems in US hospitals      is empirically predicted; finally, the current technology's state-of-the-art is      assessed. DATA SOURCE: Secondary data from 3 years of the Leapfrog Group's annual      survey (2002-2004) of US tertiary-care hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: This study      estimates CPOE market penetration rates applying technology diffusion theory and       Bass modeling techniques for three future CPOE adoption scenarios-'Optimistic,'      'Best estimate', and 'Conservative' are empirically derived. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:       Two of the CPOE adoption scenarios have diffusion S-curve that indicates a      technology will achieve significant market penetration. Under current conditions,      CPOE adoption in urban hospitals will not reach 80% penetration until 2029.      CONCLUSIONS: The promise of improved quality of care through medication error     reductions and significant cost controls prompted the Institute of Medicine to      call for universal CPOE adoption by 1999. However, the CPOE products available as      of 2006 represent only a 'second generation technology', characterized by many      limitations. Without increased external and internal pressures, such CPOE systems      are unlikely to achieve full diffusion in US hospitals in a timely manner.      Alternatively, developing a new generation of CPOE technology that is more      'user-friendly' and easily integrated into hospitals' legacy systems may be a      more expedient approach to achieving widespread adoption.

PMID- 18036885   - OBJECTIVES: To describe the patterns of computer use during patient visits to      family doctors and to determine whether doctors alter their pattern of computer     use in consultations which have significant psychological content. DESIGN:      Observational, non-randomised cluster trial with data being collected from      videotaped consultations. SETTING: Three inner-city Family Practice offices      involved in physician training in Belfast, Northern Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Ten      family doctors, who declared using computers during their consultations and      consecutive consenting adult patients attending these doctors. RESULTS: One      hundred consultations were videotaped (59% patient participation rate). The      average consultation time was 9min 48s, and number of problems per consultation      was 1.9. Three broad styles of computer use were defined: (1) "end users" who      only used the computer at the end of a consultation to summarise the      consultation, (2) "continuous users", who interacted with the computer throughout      the consultation, and (3) "minimal users", who only ever used the computer at the      end of the consultation mostly to issue prescriptions. Of the 100 consultations      videoed 37% were of a psychological nature. Consultations with psychological      content were on average longer (11min 47s vs. 8min 39s) and the average      percentage time doctors spent on the computer was about half that of      non-psychological consultations (11% vs. 23% and p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The      doctors were found to adopt one of three broad styles of computer use during      their consultations. In consultations with observable significant psychological      content doctors significantly reduce the proportion of time at the computer     suggesting an ability to appropriately tailor their use of the computer during      consultations.

PMID- 18035589   - OBJECTIVE: The increasing use of medical administrative databases in hospital      financing means more attention is being paid to their quality. The object of this      study is to compare diagnoses found in the medical database to treatments      mentioned in the billing database and to identify hospital stays with      discrepancies. METHOD: The analysis is performed for the diagnoses of heart      failure, hypertension, and pneumonia. Data were extracted from the 2000 National       Medical Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) database and from the 2000 National bill      summary database. The in-hospital stays were split into four analysis groups:      patients with the selected disease and a corresponding treatment, patients with      the selected disease but without a corresponding treatment, patients with a      treatment, without the selected disease, but with another pathology requiring the      same treatment, and patients with a treatment, without the selected disease and      without any other pathology requiring the same treatment. RESULTS: The proportion      of in-hospital stays with the disease in the medical database but without a      corresponding treatment mentioned in the billing database was 1.1% for heart      failure, 12.0% for hypertension, and 5.1% for pneumonia. Under-reporting (patient      with a treatment but without any corresponding disease) concerned a high      proportion of stays for heart failure and for hypertension (29.6% and 26.8%,      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This database comparison identified hospital stays      with discrepancies between the medical database and the billing database. This      method allows a better focus on the medical MBDS to be reviewed but must be      completed by a thorough analysis of the medical chart. An extension of this      methodology to other pathology would be useful to assess the quality of      administrative data.

PMID- 18032097   - AIM: To investigate the short- and long-term impact of the Electronic Information      Skills (EIS) Intervention on student information searching and evaluation      behaviour. METHOD: Participants were second-year undergraduate radiography      students. The EIS Intervention was a purposefully designed intervention with its       knowledge construction activities aimed at engaging students with database      searching and evaluation of internet sources as these were identified from the      literature review as areas that are poorly developed in undergraduate students.      Questionnaire was used to document the information searching and internet      evaluation behaviour of the students pre-, post- and 1-year post-involvement in      the EIS Intervention. Information search behaviour was assessed using a      four-point scale of self-reported frequency of searching: always, usually (>1/2      the time), sometimes (<1/2 the time) and rarely, for the following electronic      resources: internet, databases and library catalogue. Open questions were used to      determine the criteria students used to evaluate internet information and to      identify which databases and search engines they used. RESULTS: Pre-intervention,      83% of students always or usually searched the internet for university      assignments and projects compared with 53% for databases. This frequency of      database searching by students increased to 93% post-intervention and remained      high 1-year post-intervention (100%). Internet searching continued to be a      routine part of student search process post- (73%) and 1-year post-intervention      (79%). The number of students searching more than one database increased from 39%      pre- to 96% post-intervention. Pre-intervention 62% of students listed one      criterion that they used to evaluate information retrieved from the internet and       no students named three or more criteria. Post-intervention and 1-year     post-intervention 69% and 80%, respectively, listed 3 or more criteria they used       to evaluate information retrieved from the internet. CONCLUSION: This research      demonstrates that a purposefully designed intervention, the EIS Intervention, can      be used to transform information searching and information evaluation behaviour.       This transformation supports students' abilities to autonomously search and      obtain high quality relevant information resources to meet their learning needs      as they engage in independent learning activities as undergraduate students and      as graduate health practitioners.

PMID- 18023611   - OBJECTIVE: To identify all published studies evaluating computerized physician      order entry (CPOE) in the inpatient setting and uniformly classify these studies       on outcome measure and study design. DATA SOURCES: All studies that evaluated the      effect of CPOE on outcomes pertaining to the medication process in inpatients      were electronically searched in MEDLINE (1966 to August 2006), EMBASE (1980 to      August 2006) and the Cochrane library. In addition, the bibliographies of      retrieved articles were manually searched. Articles were selected if one of their     main objectives was CPOE evaluation in an inpatient setting. REVIEW METHOD:      Identified titles and abstracts were independently screened by three reviewers to      determine eligibility for further review. RESULTS: We found 67 articles, which      included articles on CPOE evaluation on some outcome at the time of ordering.      Most papers evaluated multiple outcome measures. The outcome measures were      clustered in the following categories: adherence (n=22); alerts and      appropriateness of alerts (n=7); safety (n=21); time (n=7); costs and      (organizational) efficiency (n=23); and satisfaction, usage and usability (n=10).      Most studies used a before-after design (n=35) followed by observational studies       (n=24) and randomized controlled trials (n=8). CONCLUSION: The impact of CPOE      systems was especially positive in the category adherence to guidelines, but also      to some extent in alerts and appropriateness of alerts; costs and organizational       efficiency; and satisfaction and usability. Although on average, there seems to      be a positive effect of CPOE on safety, studies tended to be non-randomized and      were focused on medication error rates, not powered to detect a difference in      adverse drug event rates. Some recent studies suggested that errors, adverse drug      events (ADEs) and even mortality increased after CPOE implementation. Only in the      category time the impact has been shown to be negative, but this only refers to      the physician's time, not the net time. Except for safety, on the whole spectrum       of outcomes, results of RCT studies were in line with non-RCT study results.

PMID- 18023610   - GOAL: To identify any major factors that could affect patients' perceptions of a       Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) and use the findings to contribute to      development of a theoretical framework for patient acceptance of HTMS. MATERIALS       AND METHODS: Ten Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with patients      suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary      disease (COPD), or both, from seven different ethnic groups in Sydney. Six key      discussion points were used to conduct the FGIs. The participants were shown a      video demonstrating the HTMS and its operation, followed by the demonstration of       an HTMS prototype. The participants, who had no prior experience with the HTMS,      were then asked questions to access their perceptions in potentially real      situations. The discussions were audio-taped and content analysis performed.      RESULTS: Four major themes and 16 sub-themes were identified. The themes were:      intention to use the HTMS, the impact of the HTMS on patients' health management,      concerns associated with using the HTMS, and the impact of the HTMS on healthcare      services. CONCLUSION: Most participants perceived the system as a useful and      convenient mode of health care delivery, expressed positive attitudes toward the       HTMS and expressed intent to use the system. However, there were concerns centred      on the issues of cost, ease of use, clinical support, low self-efficacy and      anxiety related to the use of the HTMS. The findings of this study suggest that      HTMS self-efficacy and anxiety are likely to be important constructs in patients'      acceptance of home telecare. Therefore, we propose these two factors be included       in future HTMS acceptance models. Also it is suggested that in order to develop      training programs for patients to use HTMS, tailored training components should      aim to reduce 'HTMS anxiety' and improve 'HTMS self-efficacy'. Participants      agreed that the HTMS would save cost and time by reducing hospital admissions,      emergency department and medical practitioner visits and associated travel.      Participants generally agreed that the HTMS could inform patients of their health      conditions, thus promoting active participation in their health management and      empowering them to perform better self-care. Also, they agreed that the HTMS      could improve their health management by their doctors by providing more accurate      and up-to-date information, to help them make better decisions. They suggested      that the HTMS could have a preventative role in terms of providing early warning       when their health conditions were deteriorating, which could lead to on-time      appropriate interventions. The latter may result in reducing the use of emergency      services and hospital admissions.

PMID- 17964851   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The realization of Health Information Systems (HIS)      requires rigorous evaluation that addresses technology, human and organization      issues. Our review indicates that current evaluation methods evaluate different      aspects of HIS and they can be improved upon. A new evaluation framework, human,       organization and technology-fit (HOT-fit) was developed after having conducted a       critical appraisal of the findings of existing HIS evaluation studies. HOT-fit      builds on previous models of IS evaluation--in particular, the IS Success Model      and the IT-Organization Fit Model. This paper introduces the new framework for     HIS evaluation that incorporates comprehensive dimensions and measures of HIS and      provides a technological, human and organizational fit. METHODS: Literature      review on HIS and IS evaluation studies and pilot testing of developed framework.      The framework was used to evaluate a Fundus Imaging System (FIS) of a primary      care organization in the UK. The case study was conducted through observation,      interview and document analysis. RESULTS: The main findings show that having the       right user attitude and skills base together with good leadership, IT-friendly      environment and good communication can have positive influence on the system      adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive, specific evaluation factors, dimensions and      measures in the new framework (HOT-fit) are applicable in HIS evaluation. The use      of such a framework is argued to be useful not only for comprehensive evaluation       of the particular FIS system under investigation, but potentially also for any      Health Information System in general.

PMID- 17951106   - PURPOSE: This paper reviews the research literature on electronic health record      (EHR) systems. The aim is to find out (1) how electronic health records are      defined, (2) how the structure of these records is described, (3) in what      contexts EHRs are used, (4) who has access to EHRs, (5) which data components of       the EHRs are used and studied, (6) what is the purpose of research in this field,      (7) what methods of data collection have been used in the studies reviewed and      (8) what are the results of these studies. METHODS: A systematic review was      carried out of the research dealing with the content of EHRs. A literature search      was conducted on four electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Cinalh, Eval and      Cochrane. RESULTS: The concept of EHR comprised a wide range of information      systems, from files compiled in single departments to longitudinal collections of      patient data. Only very few papers offered descriptions of the structure of EHRs       or the terminologies used. EHRs were used in primary, secondary and tertiary      care. Data were recorded in EHRs by different groups of health care      professionals. Secretarial staff also recorded data from dictation or nurses' or       physicians' manual notes. Some information was also recorded by patients      themselves; this information is validated by physicians. It is important that the      needs and requirements of different users are taken into account in the future      development of information systems. Several data components were documented in      EHRs: daily charting, medication administration, physical assessment, admission      nursing note, nursing care plan, referral, present complaint (e.g. symptoms),      past medical history, life style, physical examination, diagnoses, tests,      procedures, treatment, medication, discharge, history, diaries, problems,      findings and immunization. In the future it will be necessary to incorporate      different kinds of standardized instruments, electronic interviews and nursing      documentation systems in EHR systems. The aspects of information quality most      often explored in the studies reviewed were the completeness and accuracy of      different data components. It has been shown in several studies that the use of      an information system was conducive to more complete and accurate documentation      by health care professionals. The quality of information is particularly      important in patient care, but EHRs also provide important information for     secondary purposes, such as health policy planning. CONCLUSION: Studies focusing       on the content of EHRs are needed, especially studies of nursing documentation or     patient self-documentation. One future research area is to compare the      documentation of different health care professionals with the core information      about EHRs which has been determined in national health projects. The challenge      for ongoing national health record projects around the world is to take into      account all the different types of EHRs and the needs and requirements of      different health care professionals and consumers in the development of EHRs. A      further challenge is the use of international terminologies in order to achieve      semantic interoperability.

PMID- 17936681   - A socio-technical approach was used to study the qualitative effects of deploying      a medication computerized physician order entry system (CPOE with no decision      support) at two internal medical wards in a hospital in Denmark. Our results show      spatial and temporal transformations of core acts and relations in medication      work, i.e. of the intended use of the system inscribed in hardware and software,       in the relations of care between doctors and patients, of collaboration between      doctors and nurses, and prospectively of the patients' trajectories when      readmitted to hospital or another health care institution, reusing data from the       system. This study throws light on problems of continuity of patient care paths,       patient-related and IT-system-related error handling and time spent on core      activities--when ubiquitous IT is used locally in a real physical setting with      specific traditions of performing or 'doing medication'. The paper argues for the      project organization to support the local collaboration and renegotiation of time      and place of enacting medication with CPOE, as well as set up feedback for     maturation of the software for future clinical use.

PMID- 17936065   - OBJECTIVES: The phenomenon of aging society has derived problems such as shortage      of medical resources and reduction of quality in healthcare services. METHOD:      This paper presents a system infrastructure for pervasive and long-term      healthcare applications, i.e. a ubiquitous network composed of wireless local      area network (WLAN) and cable television (CATV) network serving as a platform for     monitoring physiological signals. Users can record vital signs including heart      rate, blood pressure, and body temperature anytime either at home or at      frequently visited public places in order to create a personal health file.      RESULTS: The whole system was formally implemented in December 2004. Analysis of       2000 questionnaires indicates that 85% of users were satisfied with the provided       community-wide healthcare services. Among the services provided by our system,      health consultation services offered by family doctors was rated the most      important service by 17.9% of respondents, and was followed by control of one's      own health condition (16.4% of respondents). Convenience of data access was rated      most important by roughly 14.3% of respondents. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We      proposed and implemented a long-term healthcare system integrating WLAN and CATV       networks in the form of a ubiquitous network providing a service platform for     physiological monitoring. This system can classify the health levels of the      resident according to the variation tendency of his or her physiological signal      for important reference of health management.

PMID- 17931963   - OBJECTIVE: To determine what "average" clinicians in organizations that were      about to implement Computer-based Provider Order Entry (CPOE) were expecting to      occur, we conducted an open-ended, semi-structured survey at three community      hospitals. METHODS: We created an open-ended, semi-structured, interview survey      template that we customized for each organization. This interview-based survey      was designed to be administered orally to clinicians and take approximately 5 min      to complete, although clinicians were allowed to discuss as many advantages or     disadvantages of the impending system roll-out as they wanted to. RESULTS: Our     survey findings did not reveal any overly negative, critical, problematic, or     striking sets of concerns. However, from the standpoint of unintended      consequences, we found that clinicians were anticipating only a few of the      events, emotions, and process changes that are likely to result from CPOE.      CONCLUSIONS: The results of such an open-ended survey may prove useful in helping      CPOE leaders to understand user perceptions and predictions about CPOE, because      it can expose issues about which more communication, or discussion, is needed.      Using the survey, implementation strategies and management techniques outlined in      this paper, any chief information officer (CIO) or chief medical information      officer (CMIO) should be able to adequately assess their organization's CPOE      readiness, make the necessary mid-course corrections, and be prepared to deal      with the currently identified unintended consequences of CPOE should they occur.

PMID- 17923433   - PURPOSE: Cost-minimization is a main topic in present-day health care. Clinicians      are urged to keep hospital stays as short as possible, also in Obstetrics and      Gynaecology Departments. At present stabilized high-risk pregnant women stay in      hospital for the sole purpose of being monitored. METHOD: In this retrospective      study the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring of such high-risk pregnant women      was calculated by analyzing the data of 456 episodes originating from 415      patients of the Ghent University Hospital. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It was      determined that telemonitoring made a cost-reduction of euro 145,822 per year     possible. However, variables such as educational level, psychosocial situation,      time-travel distance from home to the hospital, reimbursement system and actual      clinical status were not included. Furthermore, the Belgian health authorities      does not provide for a specific code to allow the billing of teleinterpretation      of transmitted results.

PMID- 17921048   - BACKGROUND: The detrimental effects of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are well      established. Hence, precise and accurate assessment of ADRs' causality which can       differentiate signal from noise is crucial in screening, management and      minimisation of ADRs. OBJECTIVE: The current study reported our attempt to      improve the scoring system of a previously published algorithm of ADR assessment       by our group using a genetic algorithm approach so that the final score can      measure the probability of ADR causality. DESIGN: Using ADR cases obtained from      the Centre for Drug Administration, the national centre for pharmacovigilance in       Singapore, with known causality probability values as reference points, rules      were developed to define possible combinations of criteria for 'Definite' ADR     cases and 'Probable' ADR cases. A new scoring system was developed using these      parameters with the help of genetic algorithm, and tested on 37 'Definite' and      431 'Not Definite' ADR cases. In addition, sensitivity and specificity analysis      were performed to allow a comparison of performance between our algorithm and      that used by the Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee in Australia (ADRAC).      RESULTS: The new scoring system is able to provide a probability of the causality      of an ADR by a suspected drug. When applied to the 'Definite' and 'Not Definite'       ADR reports, the new algorithm gave a sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity of      71.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Using a quantitative method of assessing causality in the new      algorithm allows rare and new ADRs to be more readily identified since a      quantitative score can give a more precise degree of ADR causality. This scoring       system that provides a probability score would help to make this algorithm more      informative and assistive for clinicians, regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical      companies to generate ADR alerts. The higher sensitivity value displayed by our     algorithm also shows that it would be a good ADR screening tool.

PMID- 17904900   - INTRODUCTION: This article describes the evaluation of a prototype speech-input      interface to an anaesthesia patient record, conducted in a full-scale anaesthesia      simulator involving six doctor-nurse anaesthetist teams. OBJECTIVE: The aims of      the experiment were, first, to assess the potential advantages and disadvantages       of a vocal interface compared to the traditional touch-screen and keyboard      interface to an electronic anaesthesia record during crisis situations; second,      to assess the usability in a realistic work environment of some speech input      strategies (hands-free vocal interface activated by a keyword; combination of      command and free text modes); finally, to quantify some of the gains that could      be provided by the speech input modality. METHODS: Six anaesthesia teams composed      of one doctor and one nurse were each confronted with two crisis scenarios in a      full-scale anaesthesia simulator. Each team would fill in the anaesthesia record,      in one session using only the traditional touch-screen and keyboard interface      while in the other session they could also use the speech input interface.      Audio-video recordings of the sessions were subsequently analysed and additional       subjective data were gathered from a questionnaire. Analysis of data was made by       a method inspired by queuing theory in order to compare the delays associated to       the two interfaces and to quantify the workload inherent to the memorization of      items to be entered into the anaesthesia record. RESULTS: The experiment showed      on the one hand that the traditional touch-screen and keyboard interface imposes       a steadily increasing mental workload in terms of items to keep in memory until      there is time to update the anaesthesia record, and on the other hand that the      speech input interface will allow anaesthetists to enter medications and      observations almost simultaneously when they are given or made. The tested speech      input strategies were successful, even with the ambient noise. Speaking to the      system while working appeared feasible, although improvements in speech      recognition rates are needed. CONCLUSION: A vocal interface leads to shorter time      between the events to be registered and the actual registration in the electronic      anaesthesia record; therefore, this type of interface would likely lead to      greater accuracy of items recorded and a reduction of mental workload associated       with memorization of events to be registered, especially during time constrained       situations. At the same time, current speech recognition technology and speech      interfaces require user training and user dedication if a speech interface is to       be used successfully.

PMID- 17904899   - PURPOSE: To explore the quality of data recording by practices and identify      issues to be considered and addressed before such data can be used as a      continuous measure of immunisation delivery. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four     randomly selected general practices visited to measure immunisation coverage      using the various practice management systems (PMS) in use. To capture all target      children it was necessary to build two queries: one generated a list of all      children aged between 6 weeks and 2 years who had been to the practice,      regardless of enrollment status; the other asked dates and nature of all      immunisations given. Each different PMS required a unique query to extract the      necessary information. RESULTS: Variability encountered included different types       and versions of PMS and operating systems; variable degree of staff technical      competence with their PMS; proportion of enrolled children ranging from nearly 0       to 100%; lack of consistency of the nature and location of data entry and coding;      and unreliability of dates relating to some vaccination events. RECOMMENDATIONS:       To improve recording of immunisation coverage we recommend a standard early age      of registration and enrollment; standard definitions of the denominator and of      immunisation delay; greater uniformity of PMS; improved staff training; intrinsic      data quality checks; integration of PMS with changes in the immunisation      schedule; incentives and interval electronic checks to improve data quality.

PMID- 17904898   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evaluation of health information systems (HIS) enables      the assessment of the extent to which HIS are fulfilling their objectives in      supporting the services of healthcare delivery. This paper presents an overview      of evaluation in health informatics and information systems. METHODS: Literature       review on discourses, dimensions and methods of HIS and IS evaluation. A critical      appraisal of selected HIS and IS evaluation frameworks is undertaken in order to       identify HIS evaluation dimensions and measures. The frameworks are compared      based on their inclusion of human, organizational and technological factors.      RESULTS: We found that an increasing number of evaluation studies deal with two      distinct trends of HIS: one considers human and organizational issues and the      other is concerned with the employment of a subjectivist approach. Our review      indicates that current evaluation methods complement each other in that they      evaluate different aspects of HIS and they can be improved upon. CONCLUSIONS:      Evaluation is complex; it is easy to measure many things but not necessarily the       right ones. Nevertheless, it is possible to consider, a HIS evaluation framework       with more comprehensive and specific measures that would incorporate      technological, human and organizational issues to facilitate HIS evaluation.

PMID- 17904897   - PURPOSE: To illustrate approaches for providing decision support for     evidence-based nursing practice through integration of evidence into clinical      information systems (CISs) with examples from our experience at Columbia      University Medical Center. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: Examples are organized according      to three types of decision support functions: information management, focusing      attention, and patient-specific consultation. METHODS: Three decision support      tools that are integrated into three types of CISs are discussed: (1) infobuttons      that provide context-specific access to digital sources of evidence; (2)      automated Fall-Injury Risk Assessment; and (3) personal digital assistant-based      screening reminders, screening assessments, and tailored documentation templates       for the identification and management of obesity, depression, and tobacco      cessation. The informatics infrastructure for implementing these decision support      tools is described from the perspective of components identified in the published      literature. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to facilitate application of evidence into      nursing practice are unlikely to be successful unless the approaches used are      integrated into the clinical workflow. Our approaches use a variety of      informatics methods to integrate evidence into CISs as a mechanism for providing       decision support for evidence-based practice in a manner consistent with nursing       workflow.

PMID- 17904896   - BACKGROUND: Heart attack risk calculators are readily accessible on the world      wide web, offering potentially powerful means of health education and risk      awareness. Laypersons may be unaware of differences in applicability, risk      calculation algorithms and output formats among such calculators. This study      assesses the impact of basic web searching terms on type of calculator accessed      and on the resulting risk score. DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS:      Seventy-two notional individual risk factor profiles were constructed, based on      six combinations of presence or absence of smoking habit, hypercholesterolaemia,       mixed hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and family history of premature coronary      disease among males and females in age groups 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 years.      The term heart attack risk calculator was entered into the Google, Yahoo, MSN,      AltaVista and Excite search engines. RESULTS: The first five web pages purporting      to contain heart attack risk calculators were included. Subpages of URLs leading       to duplicate calculators were excluded. All search engines provided similar     "hits" for the same search term. Framingham or PROCAM risk prediction models were      the templates for all calculators. Different calculators often gave different      absolute percentage risk scores for the same notional risk factor profiles.      Differences were clinically insignificant in most cases when comparisons were      made between bracketed risk scores within 5% of one another. One calculator gave       disproportionately high risk estimates for women compared to men with the same      risk factor profile and compared to other calculators into which identical risk      profiles were entered. CONCLUSIONS: Simple search terms resulted in appropriate      "hits". All calculators were based on reputable risk assessment models. There was      broad agreement across different calculators for the range of risk factor     profiles entered, but one calculator gave inconsistent risk scores.

PMID- 17881285   - PURPOSE: The present study evaluated whether an intervention using the SMS by      personal cellular phone and internet would improve the levels of plasma glucose      of obese type 2 diabetes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. METHODS: This is a      quasi-experimental design with pre- and follow-up tests. Participants were      recruited from the endocrinology outpatient department of tertiary care hospital       located in an urban city of South Korea. Eighteen patients were randomly assigned      to an intervention group and 16 to a control group. The goal of the intervention       was to decrease body weight and keep blood glucose concentrations close to the      normal range. Patients were requested to record their blood glucose level in a      weekly diary on the website by personal cellular phones or computer internet. The      researcher sent optimal recommendations to each patient, by both the cellular     phone and the Internet weekly. The intervention was applied for 1 year. RESULTS:       Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1)c) decreased 1.22 percentage points at 3 months,      1.09 percentage points at 6 months, 1.47 percentage points at 9 months, and 1.49       percentage points at 12 months compared with baseline in the intervention group      (all time points, p<0.05). The percentage change in the control group was,      however, not significant. Patients in the intervention group had a decrease of      2-h post-prandial test (2HPPT) of 120.1mg/dl at 3 months, 58.9 mg/dl at 6 months,      62.0mg/dl at 9 months, and 102.9 mg/dl at 12 months compared with baseline (all      time points, p<0.05). The mean change in the control group was, however, not      significant. CONCLUSION: This web-based intervention using SMS of personal      cellular phone and Internet improved HbA(1)c and 2HPPT at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months       in patients with obese type 2 diabetes.

PMID- 17870659   - INTRODUCTION: This article describes the development of EPICON; an application to      group ICPC-coded diagnoses from electronic medical records in general practice      into episodes of care. These episodes can be used to estimate prevalence and      incidence rates. METHODS: We used data from 89 practices that participated in the      Dutch National Survey of General Practice. Additionally, we held interviews with       seven experts, and studied documentation to establish the requirements of the      application and to develop the design. We then performed a formative evaluation      by assessing incorrectly grouped diagnoses. RESULTS: EPICON is based on a      combination of logical expressions, a decision table, and information extracted      from individual cases by case-based reasoning. EPICON is able to group all      diagnoses in the selected 89 practices, and groups 95% correctly. CONCLUSION: The      results cautiously indicate that EPICONs performance will probably be adequate      for the purpose of estimating morbidity rates in general practice.

PMID- 17827057   - BACKGROUND: Text-mining has been used to link biomedical concepts, such as genes       or biological processes, to each other for annotation purposes or the generation       of new hypotheses. To relate two concepts to each other several authors have used      the vector space model, as vectors can be compared efficiently and transparently.      Using this model, a concept is characterized by a list of associated concepts,      together with weights that indicate the strength of the association. The      associated concepts in the vectors and their weights are derived from a set of      documents linked to the concept of interest. An important issue with this      approach is the determination of the weights of the associated concepts. Various       schemes have been proposed to determine these weights, but no comparative studies      of the different approaches are available. Here we compare several weighting      approaches in a large scale classification experiment. METHODS: Three different      techniques were evaluated: (1) weighting based on averaging, an empirical      approach; (2) the log likelihood ratio, a test-based measure; (3) the uncertainty      coefficient, an information-theory based measure. The weighting schemes were      applied in a system that annotates genes with Gene Ontology codes. As the gold      standard for our study we used the annotations provided by the Gene Ontology      Annotation project. Classification performance was evaluated by means of the      receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve using the area under the curve      (AUC) as the measure of performance. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All methods      performed well with median AUC scores greater than 0.84, and scored considerably       higher than a binary approach without any weighting. Especially for the more      specific Gene Ontology codes excellent performance was observed. The differences       between the methods were small when considering the whole experiment. However,      the number of documents that were linked to a concept proved to be an important      variable. When larger amounts of texts were available for the generation of the      concepts' vectors, the performance of the methods diverged considerably, with the      uncertainty coefficient then outperforming the two other methods.

PMID- 17825607   - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the paper is to propose a methodology for learning      gene regulatory networks from DNA microarray data based on the integration of      different data and knowledge sources. We applied our method to Saccharomyces      cerevisiae experiments, focusing our attention on cell cycle regulatory      mechanisms. We exploited data from deletion mutant experiments (static data),      gene expression time series (dynamic data) and the knowledge encoded in the Gene       Ontology. METHODS: The proposed method is based on four phases. An initial gene      network was derived from static data by means of a simple statistical approach.      Then, the genes classified in the Gene Ontology as being involved in the cell      cycle were selected. As a third step, the network structure was used to      initialize a linear dynamic model of gene expression profiles. Finally, a genetic      algorithm was applied to update the gene network exploiting data coming from an      experiment on the yeast cell cycle. RESULTS: We compared the network models      provided by our approach with those obtained with a fully data-driven approach,      by looking at their AIC scores and at the percentage of preserved connections in       the best solutions. The results show that several nearly equivalent solutions, in      terms of AIC scores, can be found. This problem is greatly mitigated by following      our approach, which is able to find more robust models by fixing a portion of the      network structure on the basis of prior knowledge. The best network structure was      biologically evaluated on a set of 22 known cell cycle genes against independent       knowledge sources. CONCLUSIONS: An approach able to integrate several sources of       information is needed to infer gene regulatory networks, as a fully data-driven      search is in general prone to overfitting and to unidentifiability problems. The       learned networks encode hypotheses on regulatory relationships that need to be      verified by means of wet-lab experiments.

PMID- 17719839   - BACKGROUND: The development of problem-oriented conceptual models for electronic       patient record (EPR) systems can improve data communication between health      professionals. But little has been done so far to investigate to what extent it      is possible to implement such models in operational EPR systems. OBJECTIVE: In      this paper, we measure the conformance between a conceptual model and the various      ways it is implemented within general practitioners' (GPs') electronic patient      records. METHODS: We started from a simple problem-oriented conceptual model and       we defined an original discriminating method to assess its implementation. This      method is scenario-based (dummy patient), functional, and relative (comparison      between software systems). Each implementation is assessed by two evaluators and       the final result is a "success/failure" score. The assessment was performed      within the scope of the official Belgian accreditation procedure for GPs'      electronic patient records, which is voluntary, publicly funded, and based on a      dynamic quality improvement paradigm. Almost all Belgian GPs' software systems      (17) were assessed. The robustness of our results was assessed through a      sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found that 65% (11/17) of the software systems       currently used succeeded in implementing the problem-oriented conceptual model      with a high confidence level (error rate<10%). The results were widely accepted      by the software developers. CONCLUSIONS: A problem-oriented conceptual model can       be successfully implemented in many operational EPR systems. The quality of the      implementation can be assessed. Our results could be used at the international      level to improve semantic interoperability between patient information systems,      for instance in relation to broader conceptual models such as the European      CONTsys pre-norm.

PMID- 17714983   - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the frequency and the specific problems      encountered in accessing Internet references in two leading medical journals      during the last 3 years. METHODS: Two investigators independently reviewed all      publications in the issues of the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet       during October 2005 to March 2006, November 2004 to January 2005, and November     2003 to January 2004. We calculated the total number of references and the subset      referred to an Internet source of each article. Then, we visited the electronic      sources to identify the Internet references and noted the problems of      accessibility, if any. When we failed to directly access the reference in the      electronic address provided by the authors, we visited the referred website; if      this was also inadequate, we performed Google searches to retrieve the missing      reference(s). RESULTS: 465/18,850 (2.5%) and 952/24,630 (3.9%) of the reviewed      references in the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet, respectively,      referred to Internet sources; from these we could not access 68/465 (14.6%) and      170/952 (17.9%) in the two journals, respectively. There were increasing      proportions of lost Internet references as they age. Searching into the website      referred by the authors of the reviewed articles could not provide the missing      information in a considerable proportion (62.2%). However, the use of an Internet      search engine (Google) helped us to identify references in other websites,      reducing the proportion of missing Internet references to 17/465 (3.7%) and      17/952 (1.8%) for the two journals, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The response "page      not found" was commonly encountered when we tried to access Internet references      in publications of leading medical journals during the last 3 years. A      considerable proportion of missing references was identified with the use of      Google search engine. Authors of scientific articles should be aware of the      problem of missing Internet references and until well-established Internet      archiving solutions are in use, they should choose carefully their Internet      references from reliable websites whenever it is impossible to avoid using them.

PMID- 17693132   - OBJECTIVE: To specify and evaluate a method for auditing medical terminological      systems (TSs) based on detecting concepts with equivalent definitions. This      method addresses two important problems: redundancy, where the same concept is      represented more than once (described by different terms), and      underspecification, where different concepts have the same representation and      hence appear indistinguishable from each other. DESIGN: The auditing method is      applicable for TSs that are or can be represented in a description logic (DL).      The method relies on the assumption that concept definitions are non-primitive      (i.e. they are regarded as providing necessary and sufficient conditions).      Whereas this assumption may not hold for many definitions, it does serve the      purpose of detecting sets of logically equivalent concepts by a DL reasoner. Such      a set may include the same concept which is defined more than once and/or     different concepts that are underspecified as they appear indistinguishable from       each other by their represented properties. Analysis of these sets provides      insight into the representation quality of concepts and provides hints at      improving the TS. MEASUREMENTS: In our case study the method is applied to the      DICE TS, a comprehensive TS in intensive care. It comprises about 2500 concepts      and 40 properties and relations. RESULTS: In DICE we found four concepts that      were defined twice. Furthermore, 100 sets were found containing more than 300      underspecified concepts. The sizes of these sets ranged from 2 to 13. Analysis      revealed that many concepts can be more completely defined, either by adding      existing relations, or by the introduction of new relations into the      terminological system. CONCLUSION: The method proved both usable and valuable for     auditing TSs. DL reasoning is fully automated and all equivalent concept      definitions are systematically found. The resulting sets of equivalent concepts      clearly point out which concept definitions are to be reviewed, as they contain      duplicate definitions of a concept, and (inherently or unnecessarily)      underspecified concepts.

PMID- 17681878   - BACKGROUND: Internet-based health-record management requires not only the      provision of strong data protection to prevent privacy intrusion and unauthorized      access, but also the introduction of a common healthcare-record format to allow      cooperation using heterogeneous repositories held at various hospitals. METHODS:       A secure multi-agent architecture is proposed for accessing healthcare      information through the Internet from multiple heterogeneous repositories. The      proposed system is organized into a four-tier architecture that consists of      client applications, a central access-control system, local access-control      systems, and hospital information systems. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML)      and the role-based access-control (RBAC) system are combined for efficient      repository management by providing methods for access-control, information      exchange, user authentication, data integrity, and selective encryption. RESULT:       A multi-agent architecture using XML and RBAC can interconnect heterogeneous      repositories with different formats and different hospital policies, and allow      them to communicate securely. The authorized client, having confirmed access      privileges, can retrieve the requested healthcare data in an XML-based common      data format with embedded confidentiality. CONCLUSION: The proposed method for     Internet-based exchange of patient data is particularly useful for cooperative      healthcare and the creation of lifetime healthcare records.

PMID- 17656150   - OBJECTIVES: INCA (Intelligent Control Assistant for Diabetes) is an EU funded      project aimed at improving diabetes therapy by creating a personal closed-loop      system interacting with telemedical remote control. This study aims at      identifying and applying suitable methods for a cost-benefit analysis from the      perspective of the payor for health services. METHODS: For cost analysis MOSAIK-M      was used, a method and tool for health information systems analysis and design.      Two MOSAIK-M models were created describing conventional insulin pump based      diabetes care (CSII), and INCA based diabetes care. Both models were      parameterized with costs and simulated to determine yearly costs of diabetes      management and treatment for a patient with no diabetes related complications.      Probability of developing complications and their duration were determined based       on the Archimedes model. It was parameterized with results of a clinical study      concerning HbA1c-value changes using the INCA system compared with conventional      CSII. The simulation results in form of years of disease within a 30-year time      frame were multiplied with corresponding treatment costs. RESULTS: Yearly costs      of conventional insulin CSII for a diabetes type 1 patient are euro 5908 (German       health care system). Using INCA based on the clinical study setting would raise      yearly costs by euro 2233. 24% of the INCA costs are generated by the continuous       blood glucose measurement device, 5% by IT devices and services. Considering also      diabetes related complications in a 30-year time frame and HbA1c value reductions      from 7.9 and 7.6% (conventional CSII) to 7.5 and 7.3% (INCA) reduces the      additional costs of INCA to euro 2102 and euro 2162. CONCLUSIONS: The approach      produces an estimation of a lower bound for cost savings concerning the treatment      of diabetes related complications in a 30-year time frame. These savings alone do      not prove cost efficiency of the INCA approach. Further work is needed to improve      the approximation and to include indirect and intangible costs.

PMID- 17652015   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a general purpose web-based system for active support in      using protocols. METHODS: The conceptual model underlying the design of the      overall decision support system is drawn from fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic      giving rise to a framework for both acquiring and representing descriptive and      operational protocol knowledge. It has been conceived as a web application,      designed and implemented according to the technological standards of Internet, in      particular XML language and web services, to guarantee distributed      functionalities for multicentric studies and the re-use of domain knowledge and      problem solving strategies. RESULTS: Solutions have been evaluated experimentally      addressing the specific domain of Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) specializing       the general purpose procedures to the dedicated "Research Diagnostic Criteria"      (RDC)/TMD protocol. The accuracy of the system was correlated with a set of 50      clinically cases consecutively selected from the Gnatology Department. The      results were consistent in 100% of cases. The systematic observation by      physicians of both activated rules and diagnostic judgements identified and      explicitly formalized additional diagnostic rules in the same context.      CONCLUSIONS: Active protocol support based on fuzzy diagnostic reasoning and      advanced web-based technologies shows great potentialities for the renewed role      DSSs are called to play in the increasingly wide scale context of evidence-based       medicine.

PMID- 17646128   - PURPOSE: To apply the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) to identify very      elderly Intensive Care (IC) patients at high risk of mortality, and compare the      results with those of a conventional logistic regression model. METHODS: A      database containing all 12,993 consecutive admissions of patients aged at least      80 between January 1997 and October 2005 from intensive care units (n=33) of      mixed type taking part in the National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) registry.      Demographic, diagnostic, physiologic, laboratory, discharge and prognostic score       data were collected. After application of the SAPS II inclusion criteria 6617      patients remained. In these data we searched PRIM subgroups requiring at least      85% mortality and coverage of at least 3% of the patients. Equally sized      subgroups were derived from a recalibrated (second level customization)      Simplified Acute Physiology Score II model, where new coefficients were fitted.      Subgroups were compared on an independent validation set using the positive      predictive value (PPV), here equaling the subgroup mortality. RESULTS: We      identified four subgroups with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 92%, 90%, 87%      and 87%, covering, respectively, 3%, 3.5%, 7% and 10% of the patients in the      validation set. Urine production, lowest pH, lowest systolic blood pressure,      mechanical ventilation, all measured within 24 h after admission, and admission      type and Glasgow Coma Score were used to define these subgroups. SAPS and PRIM      subgroups had equal PPVs. CONCLUSIONS: PRIM successfully identified high-risk      subgroups. The subgroups compare in performance to SAPS II, but require less data      to collect, result in more homogenous groups and are likely to be more useful for     decision makers.

PMID- 17646127   - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to gain more insight in whether care programming in      health care can be supported by IT and what is needed for successful      implementation. We evaluated a case where an organization structured its care      processes into care programs and used a planning tool for planning and control of      the care programs. The results of this evaluation contribute to existing      knowledge about the relation between care processes and IT as well as IT      implementation. METHOD: We used multiple data sources to support and complete the      results. The evaluation of the case took place by means of face-to-face      interviews, a document study and analyses of emails. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The       care programs and the planning tool were not compatible and did not achieve the      intended goals. The professionals failed to appreciate flexibility of the care      programs. The implementation of the planning tool failed because of too little      user involvement in the implementation. Moreover, care programs were in general      not accepted by the professionals. All this resulted in a non-fit between the      care programs and the planning tool. We advise for routine processes as care      programs to develop a balance between flexibility and standardization. This is a       process of trial and error and requires adaptive information technology and user       involvement in development and implementation.

PMID- 17646126   - BACKGROUND: Information technology presents new opportunities to facilitate      clinicians' access to up-to-date clinical information. Developing countries have       special needs in this area and the problems encountered in obtaining clinical      information have not been well researched, particularly for hospital doctors. No       previous study has examined which clinical information sources Mongolian hospital      doctors' use and the problems they may encounter in obtaining information. This      study addressed an important knowledge gap by examining clinical      information-seeking practices of Mongolian hospital doctors. The objectives of      the study were to ascertain: (a) which clinical information sources were used in       clinical decision-making; (b) the level of confidence in these information      sources, and (c) the impact these information sources had on clinical      decision-making. Also investigated was proficiency in English language and      computer skills, as these factors could influence ability to obtain clinical      information electronically. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were given       to 263 doctors from the two largest hospitals in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of      Mongolia. Respondents answered questions about 10 information sources:      colleagues; local and foreign textbooks; local and foreign journals; personal      notes; computer-aided literature searches; Mongolian clinical practice      guidelines; and brief updates and health policies developed in Mongolia.      Parameters of interest included: frequency of use; confidence in the sources; and      perceived impact of the sources on clinical decision-making. RESULTS: The      response rate was 87% (229). The respondents indicated that discussion with      colleagues was the most frequently used information source, foreign medical      textbooks most commonly inspired high confidence, and discussion with colleagues       was the source most often perceived as having a high impact on clinical      decision-making. For all sources, high confidence and high impact were strongly      associated with each other. Only 26% of respondents understood English well, and       only 41% had excellent/good computer skills. English language and computer skills      were strongly associated with undertaking computer-aided literature searches and       with age. Female respondents were less likely than males to have excellent/good      computer skills and less likely to undertake computer-aided literature searches.       CONCLUSIONS: Satisfying the clinical information needs of doctors in less      developed countries is particularly challenging and even though improvements in      information technology can facilitate access to knowledge, there still exist      barriers. Health policies which promote computer skills and English language      among doctors may contribute substantially to best medical practice in Mongolia.

PMID- 17644029   - PURPOSE: Ever since National Health Insurance was introduced in 1995, the number       of insurants increased to over 96% from 50 to 60%, with a continuous satisfaction      rating of about 70%. However, the premium accounted for 5.77% of GDP in 2001 and       the Bureau of National Health Insurance had pressing financial difficulties, so      it reformed its expenditure systems, such as fee for service, capitation, case      payment and the global budget system in order to control the rising medical      costs. Since the change in health insurance policy, most hospitals attempted to      reduce their operating expenses and improve efficiency. Introducing the      electronic logistics information system is one way of reducing the cost of the      department of central warehouse and the nursing stations. Hence, the study      proposes a technology acceptance research model and examines how nurses'      acceptance of the e-logistics information system has been affected in the medical      industry. METHODS: This research combines innovation diffusion theory, technology      acceptance model and added two research parameters, trust and perceived financial      cost to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model. Taking Taiwan's medical      industry as an experimental example, this paper studies nurses' acceptance of the      electronic logistics information system. The structural equation modeling      technique was used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis       was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model.      RESULTS: The results of the survey strongly support the new hybrid technology      acceptance model in predicting nurses' intention to use the electronic logistics       information system. CONCLUSION: The study shows that 'compatibility', 'perceived       usefulness', 'perceived ease of use', and 'trust' all have great positive      influence on 'behavioral intention to use'. On the other hand 'perceived      financial cost' has great negative influence on behavioral intention to use.

PMID- 17631412   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a computer reminder     system (CRS) to improve prescribing behaviour in general practice and to explore       the strengths and weaknesses of a reminder system. One group of GPs received      reminders on cholesterol lowering drugs, the other group on antibiotics, asthma      and COPD drugs. METHODS: Process evaluation of the computer reminder system being      used by 53 GPs in 20 practices, by means of an analysis of the research database       of the CRS. In addition, a questionnaire and semi-structured face-to-face      interview were conducted with all GP practices, two project leaders, and one      technical consultant. RESULTS: The strategy was largely carried out as planned,      although the development period for the CRS had to be extended. Nine percent of      the GPs dropped out. We found a significant learning curve without extinguishing       effect (p=0.03) for the antibiotics reminders. The questionnaire showed that, in       general, GPs were satisfied with the user-friendliness and the content of the      different types of reminders, but less satisfied with certain specific technical       performance issues of the system. The GPs reported mixed feelings towards the CRS      in the interviews. They were generally positive about the guidelines themselves,       but negative regarding to the organisational context and the method of      implementing the CRS. GPs stated that they sometimes manipulated the system to      bypass reminders. Interviews with the project leaders and technical consultant      revealed barriers to cooperation and miscommunication between the different      parties, and technical problems with multiple updates of the GP information      system and the operating system. CONCLUSIONS: This process evaluation      demonstrated that the implementation of the CRS was mainly carried out as      planned, but the subjective experience of working with the CRS was not only      positive. Participating GPs had mixed feelings, and quite a number of barriers      need to be addressed to facilitate large-scale implementation of the CRS. Costs      cannot be neglected, so it is important to analyse the balance between costs and       effects.

PMID- 17616432   - OBJECTIVE: A complex set of needs--increased accessibility to and interest in      health information, more respect for patients' rights, advanced information      technologies, and pressure to seek cost-effective healthcare delivery--made the      personal health record (PHR) necessary. Nursing, as essential to healthcare, must      be represented in a PHR, but few studies have explored the nurse's role in the      development and expansion of the PHR. The aim of this project was to design and      develop an Internet-based PHR, IowaPHR, in order to demonstrate how nursing can      be integrated into the PHR. METHODS: In addition to the common features of the      PHR as detailed by previous studies, IowaPHR contains the following innovations:       (1) the information embraces major community health concerns; (2) an interactive       feature--the self-assessment and feedback field--was created by transforming a      standardized nursing language into appropriate questions adjusted for consumer     vocabulary level; and (3) a user-friendly interface was equipped with trends in      health conditions and a diary function. This PHR was then evaluated by experts in      terms of content, ease of navigation, time needed to complete tasks, ability to      find desired information, and site presentation. RESULTS: In the evaluation of      this PHR, experts assigned high scores to four items. Completion of the tasks      took an average of 16.25 min. CONCLUSION: Allowing self- or caregivers to observe      health conditions through completion of the questions on our PHR will precisely      address clinic visitors' health problems, assist in planning interventions, and      promote education of and empowerment for health care. This PHR will provide a new      way for nursing informatics to enhance the capacity of nursing in consumer health      and to make a difference in the larger context of health informatics.

PMID- 17616431   - BACKGROUND: HIV TIDES - Tailored Interventions for self-care management of      DEpressive Symptoms for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) - provides assessment      of depression and tailored education on self-care strategies to decrease the risk      of developing clinical depressive disorders. The iterative refinement of the      prototype is an important process during system development to ensure that the      design of the system is easy to use and useful. METHODS: The heuristic evaluation      and usability testing methodologies were used to guide the iteration of the HIV      TIDES. RESULTS: The system's compliance with the majority of usability concepts      and current standards was confirmed by three experts on human-computer     interaction in the heuristic evaluation. However, a number of usability problems       were identified. Refinements were made based on experts' recommendations prior to      the usability testing. The usability testing included six PLWHA with various      levels of computer experience. Data from this iterative testing informed the      refinement of key pages and the development of new features. CONCLUSIONS: The      final version of HIV TIDES consists of 73 messages. The average readability level      of the messages is 6.0 based on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and the average      word count is 103.

PMID- 17613271   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a framework for clinical practice guidelines that not only       allows the representation of best practices, but also facilitates reasoning about      acceptable alternatives for those best practices. METHOD: Design of an explicit      representation formalism of intentions of guidelines and guideline steps.      Implementation of this representation and reasoning mechanisms in GASTON, a tool       for representing and executing computerized clinical guidelines. RESULTS: The      developed formalism is used to represent a heart failure clinical guideline. It      is demonstrated that the representation of intentions provides the needed      flexibility to avoid unnecessary errors and warnings. CONCLUSION: By using an      explicit representation of the intentions of guidelines and guideline steps, a      flexible decision support system can be built that does not check only the      adherence to the formal guideline but evaluates clinical activities in light of      the intention of the guidelines.

PMID- 17606400   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a prototype personal digital       assistant-decision support system (PDA-DSS) based on a clinical practice      guideline (CPG) for the management of obesity. DESIGN: The study was composed of       four phases: (1) analysis of advanced practice nurse (APN) students'      documentation related to the management of obesity using the Clinical Log-APN      (CL-APN), (2) identification of functional requirements and data modeling through      use case analysis and unified modeling language (UML), (3) evaluation of      representation of obesity-related concepts with standardized terminologies, and      (4) design of a web-based prototype user interface. RESULTS: The analysis      revealed the documentation rate of obesity as an assessment diagnosis and      adherence to the CPG for obesity was low. Through use case analysis and UML      modeling, the functional requirements - screening, assessment, and documentation       of CPG-based obesity treatment plan - were identified and a data model was built.      Overall, the standardized terminologies that are used in the database for the      CL-APN could represent about 80% of the obesity-related concepts. However, the      terms of these standardized terminologies were not specific enough to represent      all the concepts. The systematized nomenclature of medicine-clinical terms      (SNOMED CT) could represent 83% of the concepts and was used to extend the      knowledge base. Based on the functional requirements specification, four     prototype screens were designed. CONCLUSION: The PDA-DSS for the management of      obesity has potential uses for education, nursing practice, and research. As an      educational tool, it can be used to improve APN students' adherence to the CPG's       recommendations and to enhance informatics competencies. The PDA-DSS has the      potential to improve APN students' clinical decision making at the point-of-care       and delivery of CPG-based care, thereby improving patients' outcomes related to      the management of obesity. A randomized trial is underway to investigate the      PDA-DSS's impact on APN students' screening rates and adherence to obesity CPG      recommendations, and users' acceptance of the system.

PMID- 17604685   - OBJECTIVES: The present study discusses ethics in building and using applications      based on natural language processing in electronic nursing documentation.      Specifically, we first focus on the question of how patient confidentiality can      be ensured in developing language technology for the nursing documentation      domain. Then, we identify and theoretically analyze the ethical outcomes which      arise when using natural language processing to support clinical judgement and      decision-making. In total, we put forward and justify 10 claims related to ethics      in applying language technology to nursing documents. METHODS: A review of recent      scientific articles related to ethics in electronic patient records or in the      utilization of large databases was conducted. Then, the results were compared      with ethical guidelines for nurses and the Finnish legislation covering health      care and processing of personal data. Finally, the practical experiences of the      authors in applying the methods of natural language processing to nursing      documents were appended. RESULTS: Patient records supplemented with natural      language processing capabilities may help nurses give better, more efficient and       more individualized care for their patients. In addition, language technology may      facilitate patients' possibility to receive truthful information about their     health and improve the nature of narratives. Because of these benefits, research       about the use of language technology in narratives should be encouraged. In      contrast, privacy-sensitive health care documentation brings specific ethical      concerns and difficulties to the natural language processing of nursing      documents. Therefore, when developing natural language processing tools, patient       confidentiality must be ensured. While using the tools, health care personnel      should always be responsible for the clinical judgement and decision-making. One       should also consider that the use of language technology in nursing narratives      may threaten patients' rights by using documentation collected for other     purposes. CONCLUSIONS: Applying language technology to nursing documents may, on       the one hand, contribute to the quality of care, but, on the other hand, threaten      patient confidentiality. As an overall conclusion, natural language processing of      nursing documents holds the promise of great benefits if the potential risks are       taken into consideration.

PMID- 17604684   - PURPOSE: Integration based on open standards, in order to achieve communication      and information interoperability, is one of the key aspects of modern health care      information systems. However, this requirement represents one of the major     challenges for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions, as      systems today use diverse technologies, proprietary protocols and communication      standards which are often not interoperable. One of the main producers of      clinical information in healthcare settings represent Radiology Information      Systems (RIS) that communicate using widely adopted DICOM (Digital Imaging and      COmmunications in Medicine) standard, but in very few cases can efficiently      integrate information of interest with other systems. In this context we      identified HL7 standard as the world's leading medical ICT standard that is      envisioned to provide the umbrella for medical data semantic interoperability,      which amongst other things represents the cornerstone for the Croatia's National       Integrated Healthcare Information System (IHCIS). The aim was to explore the      ability to integrate and exchange RIS originated data with Hospital Information      Systems based on HL7's CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) standard. METHODS: We      explored the ability of HL7 CDA specifications and methodology to address the      need of RIS integration HL7 based healthcare information systems. RESULTS: We      introduced the use of WADO service interconnection to IHCIS and finally CDA      rendering in widely used Internet explorers. The outcome of our pilot work proves      our original assumption of HL7 standard being able to adopt radiology data into      the integrated healthcare systems. CONCLUSION: Uniform DICOM to CDA translation      scripts and business processes within IHCIS is desired and cost effective      regarding to use of supporting IHCIS services aligned to SOA.

PMID- 17602865   - The development of 4D CT imaging has introduced the possibility of measuring      breathing motion of tumors and inner organs. Conformal thoracic radiation therapy      relies on a quantitative understanding of the position of lungs, lung tumors, and      other organs during radiation delivery. Using 4D CT data sets, medical image      computing and visualization methods were developed to visualize different aspects      of lung and lung tumor mobility during the breathing cycle and to extract      quantitative motion parameters. A non-linear registration method was applied to      estimate the three-dimensional motion field and to compute 3D point trajectories.      Specific visualization techniques were used to display the resulting motion      field, the tumor's appearance probabilities during a breathing cycle as well as      the volume covered by the moving tumor. Furthermore, trajectories of the tumor     center-of-mass and organ specific landmarks were computed for the quantitative      analysis of tumor and organ motion. The analysis of 4D data sets of seven      patients showed that tumor mobility differs significantly between the patients      depending on the individual breathing pattern and tumor location.

PMID- 17600764   - PURPOSE: Version 1.0 of the International Classification for Nursing Practice      (ICNP) is a logic-based compositional terminology. International Organization for     Standardization (ISO) 18104:2003 Health Informatics-Integration of a reference      terminology model for nursing is an international standard to support the      development, testing and implementation of nursing terminologies. METHODS: This      study examines how ISO 18104:2003 has been interpreted in the development of ICNP      Version 1.0 by identifying mappings between ICNP and the ISO standard.      Representations of diagnostic and interventional statements within ICNP are also       analyzed according to the requirements mandated by the ISO standard. RESULTS: All      structural components of ISO 18104:2003 i.e. semantic categories, semantic      domains, qualifiers and semantic links are represented either directly or in      interpreted form within ICNP. The formal representations within ICNP of      diagnostic and interventional statements meet the requirement of the ISO      standard. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that ICNP Version      1.0 conforms to ISO 18104:2003. More importantly perhaps, this study provides      practical examples of how components of a terminology standard might be      interpreted and it examines how such a standard might be used to support the      definition of high-level schemata in developing logic-based compositional      terminologies.

PMID- 17600763   - In this paper we describe Pangea-LE, a message-oriented lightweight data      integration engine that allows homogeneous and concurrent access to clinical      information from disperse and heterogeneous data sources. The engine extracts the      information and passes it to the requesting client applications in a flexible XML      format. The XML response message can be formatted on demand by appropriate      Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) transformations in order to meet the needs      of client applications. We also present a real deployment in a hospital where      Pangea-LE collects and generates an XML view of all the available patient      clinical information. The information is presented to healthcare professionals in      an Electronic Health Record (EHR) viewer Web application with patient search and       EHR browsing capabilities. Implantation in a real setting has been a success due       to the non-invasive nature of Pangea-LE which respects the existing information      systems.

PMID- 17600762   - PURPOSE: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are common tools for clinicians in      daily practice. In order to use CPGs effectively at the point of care,      representing CPGs into computer-interpretable format is essential. Since      computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) have been reported to increase      clinicians' usage of guidelines and improve patient's outcomes, it is critical to      assess health care knowledge translated from CPGs into CIGs. The overall goal of       this study was to illustrate the steps involved in encoding a guideline in      guideline interchange format-3 (GLIF3) through a case study of a depression      screening and management CPG for a nursing decision support system (DSS).      METHODS: This study consisted of five steps: (1) Selection of a CPG; (2)      extraction and categorization in GLIF3 of concepts related to depression      screening and management tasks; (3) converting GLIF3 steps to a flowchart; (4)      creation of scenarios representing possible execution paths; (5) guideline      execution engine (GLEE) execution of scenarios. DISCUSSION: This study      contributes to the body of knowledge regarding creation of CIGs and the use of      GLEE as an evaluation tool for the encoded CIG in GLIF format for a depression      CPG. CPG representation using GLIF3 and its evaluation by GLEE are useful methods      to prepare nursing CPGs for implementation in a DSS.

PMID- 17584524   - The purpose of this paper is to describe how qualitative data analysis software      was used in an attempt to manage and support a three-step protocol analysis of      think aloud data in a study examining emergency nurses' reasoning during triage.       The qualitative data analysis software program QSR NVivo was used to facilitate      protocol analysis and to allow the identification and description of the      information that 16 triage nurses concentrated on during triage, and how they      structured this information to make a triage decision. The detailed description      of how QSR NVivo was used for protocol analysis of think aloud data may assist      and guide future informatics research using similar methodology. Finally, the      experiences of the use of QSR NVivo for protocol analysis are discussed.

PMID- 17581772   - OBJECTIVE: Communication failures account for many adverse drug events (ADEs) in       adult primary care. Improving patient-physician communication may improve      medication safety. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to learn whether     electronic medication safety messages directed to patients can improve      communication about medications and identify ADEs. DESIGN: We studied adult      patients enrolled in a patient Internet portal at three primary care practices      affiliated with a teaching hospital. MedCheck, a medication safety application,      sent patients a secure electronic message 10 days after they received a new or     changed prescription. MedCheck asked if the patient had filled the prescription      or experienced medication-related problems, and then forwarded the patient's      response to their primary care physician. MEASUREMENTS: We selected a stratified       random sample of 267 subjects from 1821 patients who received and opened a      MedCheck message from April 2001 to June 2002. We reviewed subjects' medical      records for three months following their first MedCheck message. We analyzed      patient and clinician response rates and times, examined patient-clinician      communication about medications, and identified ADEs. RESULTS: Patients opened      79% of MedCheck messages and responded to 12%; 77% responded within 1 day.      Patients often identified problems filling their prescriptions (48%), problems      with drug effectiveness (12%), and medication symptoms (10%). Clinicians      responded to 68% of patients' messages; 93% answered within 1 week. Clinicians      often supplied or requested information (19%), or made multiple recommendations      (15%). Patients experienced 21 total ADEs; they reported 17 electronically.      CONCLUSION: Patients and physicians responded promptly to patient-directed      electronic medication messages, identifying and addressing medication-related      problems including ADEs.

PMID- 17569576   - BACKGROUND: The emergency department has been characterized as interrupt-driven.       Government agencies and patient safety organizations recognize that interruptions      contribute to medical errors. The purpose of this study was to observe, record,      and contextualize activities and interruptions experienced by physicians and      Registered Nurses (RNs) working in a Level One Trauma Center. METHODS: Design: A       case study that relied on an ethnographic study design using the shadowing      method. Subjects: A convenience sample of physicians and RNs, each with at least       6 months of experience in the Emergency Department (ED), were asked to      participate. In these kinds of detailed qualitative investigations, it is quite      common to have a small sample size. Ethical approval: Approval was obtained from       institutional ethic committees prior to initiating the study. Community consent      was obtained from the ED staff through in-service education. Setting: All      observations were made in the trauma section of the ED of a tertiary teaching      hospital. The hospital is situated in a major medical center in the Gulf Coast      region of the United States of America (USA). FINDINGS: Five attending ED      physicians were observed for a total of 29h, 31min. Eight RNs were shadowed for a      total of 40 h, 9min. Interruptions and activities were categorized using the      Hybrid Method to Categorize Interruptions and Activities (HyMCIA). Registered      Nurses received slightly more interruptions per hour than physicians. People,      pagers, and telephones were identified as mediums through which interruptions      were delivered. The physical environment was found to contribute to interruptions      in workflow because of physical design and when supplies were not available.      Physicians and RNs usually returned to the original, interrupted activity more      often than leaving the activity unfinished. CONCLUSION: This research provides an      enhanced understanding of interruptions in workflow in the ED, the identification      of work constraints, and the need to develop interventions to manage      interruptions. It is crucial that interruptions be delivered in such a way that      there is minimal negative impact on performance. The significance and importance       of the interruption must always be weighed against the negative impact that it      has on smooth, efficient workflow.

PMID- 17569575   - OBJECTIVE: It is difficult to control drug-prescribing behaviour in general      practice, despite the development and distribution of guidelines. The purpose of       this study was to assess the effect on drug-prescribing behaviour of implementing      prescribing guidelines by means of a reactive computer reminder system (CRS).      DESIGN: Cluster-randomised controlled trial with an incomplete block design in      the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about      antibiotics and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs (7 GP practices) received      reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescription guidelines were      integrated into the computerised GP information system. MEASUREMENTS: Both      performance indicators and prescription volumes were calculated as the main      outcome measures. Next to individual volume measure, sum scores were constructed       on the volume measures per drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD and cholesterol).      RESULTS: Variation between GPs turned out to be larger and more skewed than      expected. No differences between groups were found for indicators and volumes      related to recommendations advocating certain drugs. Although there was a      tendency towards clinically relevant results for prescription volumes that were      supposed to drop, the difference in sum score between the groups was not      significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that were supposed to drop, the sum      score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8-44.5) prescriptions per     1000 patients per GP, while this was 39.7 (95% CI: 29.7-64.1) for the control      group (p 0.2). For prescriptions asthma/COPD that were supposed to drop, the sum       score for the intervention group was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6-2.6) prescriptions per 1000      patients per GP, while this was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-4.3) for the control group (p      0.1). On three specific recommendations (on quinolones for cystitis,      corticosteroids for CPOD, and antibiotics for acute sore throat) significant      differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study turned out to be underpowered due      to high inter doctor variation in prescribing behaviour. Nevertheless,      computerised reminders sometimes have a favourable effect on restricting certain       drugs that are not or no longer indicated in general practice.

PMID- 17567529   - Clinical pathways are an effective instrument to decrease undesired practice      variability and improve clinician performance. IT-applications embedded into      clinical routine work can help to increase pathway compliance. Successfully      implementing such applications requires both a responsive IT infrastructure and a      participatory and iterative design process aimed at achieving user acceptance and      usability. Experiences from the implementation and iterative improvement of an      online surgical pathway at Marburg University Medical Centre have shown that      pathway conformance actually could be improved by the use of IT. An analysis of      the iterative design process has shown that future pathway projects can benefit      from the lessons learned during this project. Based on these lessons      recommendations for developing well adapted interaction mechanisms are presented,      aimed at improving process alignment. Our goal is to build up a library of tested      reusable components to reduce the number of iterations for pathway      implementation.

PMID- 17560165   - Research into the nature and occurrence of medical errors has shown that these      often result from a combination of factors that lead to the breakdown of      workflow. Nowhere is this more critical than in the emergency department (ED),      where the focus of clinical decisions is on the timely evaluation and      stabilization of patients. This paper reports on the nature of errors and their     implications for patient safety in an adult ED, using methods of ethnographic      observation, interviews, and think-aloud protocols. Data were analyzed using      modified "grounded theory," which refers to a theory developed inductively from a      body of data. Analysis revealed four classes of errors, relating to errors of      misidentification, ranging from multiple medical record numbers, wrong patient      identification or address, and in one case, switching of one patient's      identification information with those of another. Further analysis traced the      root of the errors to ED registration. These results indicate that the nature of       errors in the emergency department are complex, multi-layered and result from an       intertwined web of activity, in which stress in the work environment, high      patient volume and the tendency to adopt shortcuts play a significant role. The      need for information technology (IT) solutions to these problems as well as the      impact of alternative policies is discussed.

PMID- 17560164   - OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of the model-driven architecture (MDA) in      health care information systems development. METHODS: An MDA is conceptualized      and developed for a health clinic system to track patient information. A      prototype of the MDA is implemented using an advanced MDA tool. The UML provides       the underlying modeling support in the form of the class diagram. The PIM to PSM       transformation rules are applied to generate the prototype application from the      model. RESULTS: The result of the research is a complete MDA methodology to      developing health care information systems. Additional insights gained include      development of transformation rules and documentation of the challenges in the      application of MDA to health care. Design guidelines for future MDA applications       are described. The model has the potential for generalizability. The overall      approach supports limited interoperability and portability. CONCLUSION: The      research demonstrates the applicability of the MDA approach to health care      information systems development. When properly implemented, it has the potential       to overcome the challenges of platform (vendor) dependency, lack of open      standards, interoperability, portability, scalability, and the high cost of      implementation.

PMID- 17556014   - BACKGROUND: Medical informatics has been guided by an individual-centered model      of human cognition, inherited from classical theory of mind, in which knowledge,       problem-solving, and information-processing responsible for intelligent behavior       all derive from the inner workings of an individual agent. OBJECTIVES AND      RESULTS: In this paper we argue that medical informatics commitment to the      classical model of cognition conflates the processing performed by the minds of      individual agents with the processing performed by the larger distributed      activity systems within which individuals operate. We review trends in cognitive       science that seek to close the gap between general-purpose models of cognition      and applied considerations of real-world human performance. One outcome is the      theory of distributed cognition, in which the unit of analysis for understanding       performance is the activity system which comprises a group of human actors, their     tools and environment, and is organized by a particular history of goal-directed       action and interaction. CONCLUSION: We describe and argue for the relevance of      distributed cognition to medical informatics, both for the study of human      performance in healthcare and for the design of technologies meant to enhance      this performance.

PMID- 17544841   - BACKGROUND: Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an emerging technology that       is rapidly becoming the standard for hospitals to track inventory, identify      patients, and manage personnel. METHODS: Research involved qualitative methods      including participant observation and interviews with hospital staff members and       industry consultants in the United States. RESULTS: Hospital staff, especially      nurses, expressed concern about the surveillance potential of these tracking      technologies. Additionally, nursing staff frequently experience an      intensification of labor as a result of the implementation of RFID systems      because the task of keeping the systems operational often falls upon them.      CONCLUSIONS: The social and organizational factors that contribute to the success      or failure of RFID systems in hospitals must be further analyzed. The      implications of RFID systems, such as privacy concerns and work intensification      for nursing and other hospital staff, should be taken into account from the      outset, especially during the design and implementation of the technology.

PMID- 17532256   - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Introduction of teledermatology in general practice changes      responsibilities and workloads of general practitioners (GPs) and dermatologists.      We investigated the time investment of GPs as well as the relative share of the      separate teledermatology activities during a store-and-forward teledermatology      consultation. METHODS: Sixty-four teledermatology consultations (eight GPs x      eight patients) were conducted in a laboratory setting. The starting and ending      time of each consultation and of five separate teledermatology activities were      recorded by independent observers. The impact of several GP, patient and      consultation characteristics on the calculated durations was investigated with      repeated measurements analysis. RESULTS: The mean duration of a teledermatology      consultation was 11:32 min (range 7:02-26:44 min). The activity 'filling out      electronic referral form' was the most time consuming teledermatology activity      (3:12 min; 28%). Most time was spent on non-TD related consultation activities,      e.g. taking medical history (4:43 min; 41%). The first of the eight consultations      (p<0.001) and consultations with female patients (p=0.032) took on average more      time than subsequent consultations (first consultations 13:42 min (male patients)      and 17:03 min (female patients), and subsequent consultations 9:56 min (male      patients) and 11:08 min (female patients)). CONCLUSIONS: Usage of      store-and-forward teledermatology increases the average duration of a GP      consultation with at least three and a half minutes. Further integration of      teledermatology applications and electronic patients' records may reduce the      total duration of a consultation and increase acceptance of teledermatology in      general practice.

PMID- 17517533   - Email has been considered as a communication medium between patients and      clinicians in pediatric emergency departments, but the demographic bias involved       in using email has not been fully explored. We developed a paper based survey to       explore access, willingness to participate and the demographic bias of email      within our parent population. METHODS: To 1733 possible subjects, 1200 surveys      were distributed with a return of 1018, a survey response rate of 85%, and a      population response rate of 59%. RESULTS: Subjects from families with incomes      less than $60,000 per year had lower access rates (OR=0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.62]),      as did those with lower education (OR=0.37, [0.17, 0.81]). Employment outside of       the home was associated with increased email access rates (OR=1.79, 95% CI [1.19,      2.70]). Visible minority status was associated with an increased willingness to      participate (OR=1.84, 95% CI [1.10, 3.06]) as was low education (OR=2.12, 95% CI       [1.04, 4.32]). The population of theoretical responders to an email based quality      assurance process would have been significantly different from the base      population of adults accompanying children to our emergency department as a      result of these biases. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a degree of demographic       bias in email access rates, negatively affecting those individuals with lower     income, less employment, and lower education. Email based surveys directed at      parents in pediatric emergency departments should include questions on income,      employment and education in order to permit those who analyze the data to correct      for these variables. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

PMID- 17517532   - The OBO ontologies include more than 50 standard vocabularies that cover     different domains, including genomics, chemistry, anatomy and phenotype. Ontology      alignment is a means to build consistent biomedical ontologies compatible with      standard vocabularies and dedicated to specific domains, such as cancer. An      alignment is defined as a set of pairs of concepts, coming from two ontologies,      related by a relation R, R not being restricted to the equivalence or subsumption      relations. Alignment is performed in three major steps: first, the concepts that       are equivalent in the ontologies are identified; second the pairs of concepts      that are related although not equivalent are searched for; third the relations      between the concepts are characterized. We have developed a method to align      ontologies that exploits the compositionality of the terms in OBO ontologies,      uses the UMLS to provide synonyms and relations, and defines syntactico-semantic       patterns that characterize semantically the relations between concepts. We have      applied it to four OBO phenotype ontologies: mouse pathology, human disease,      mammalian phenotype, and PATO. We found 386 pairs of equivalent concepts and      20,461 pairs of concepts where one concept name is included in the other term.      Among the 20,460 inclusions, we were able to provide a semantic categorization      for 2682 relations. In 2552 cases, the relation was present and semantically      defined in the UMLS Metathesaurus, in 131 cases the relation was characterized      through semantic patterns. Our approach may help to find the semantic relations      between concepts in ontologies.

PMID- 17513166   - BACKGROUND: Nursing narratives are an important part of patient documentation,      but the possibilities to utilize them in the direct care process are limited due       to the lack of proper tools. One solution to facilitate the utilization of      narrative data could be to classify them according to their content. OBJECTIVES:       Our objective is to address two issues related to designing an automated      classifier: domain experts' agreement on the content of classes Breathing, Blood       Circulation and Pain, as well as the ability of a machine-learning-based      classifier to learn the classification patterns of the nurses. METHODS: The data       we used were a set of Finnish intensive care nursing narratives, and we used the       regularized least-squares (RLS) algorithm for the automatic classification. The      agreement of the nurses was assessed by using Cohen's kappa, and the performance       of the algorithm was measured using area under ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: On      average, the values of kappa were around 0.8. The agreement was highest in the      class Blood Circulation, and lowest in the class Breathing. The RLS algorithm was      able to learn the classification patterns of the three nurses on an acceptable      level; the values of AUC were generally around 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: Our results      indicate that the free text in nursing documentation can be automatically      classified and this can offer a way to develop electronic patient records.

PMID- 17513165   - This article presents a computational model and a simulation of the decrease of      performance in daily living activities due to Alzheimer's disease. The framework       offered by the cognitive architecture ACT-R is used to develop the model. Typical      errors committed in performing tasks by Alzheimer patients are modelled thanks to      different parametrisable memory mechanisms of ACT-R and the disease evolution is       represented by the increase of errors in the execution of the task. The model is       applied to a cooking activity. Simulation of 100 subjects shows results similar     to those realised in a standardized assessment with human subjects. We conclude      on the need to introduce executive mechanisms in the modelling of behaviours      associated to people with cognitive deficits.

PMID- 17499545   - OBJECTIVES: To describe the new set-up of our Master of Science program in      medical informatics that started in September 2006 at the University of      Amsterdam-Academic Medical Center, The Netherlands. METHODS: To harmonize with      the Bologna declaration, we transformed our former medical informatics program      from a 4-year course into a 3-year bachelor and a 2-year (English) Master of      Science Medical Informatics program. We describe the objectives, organizational      structure and contents of this new medical informatics master program. RESULTS:      The new master program now is aimed at (international) baccalaureates in medical       informatics, computer science, medicine and other health-related studies and      professionals from these disciplines. The master course comprises four study      semesters of 30 EC each, equal to 120 EC in total. Central to the program is the       context of hospital organization, encompassing medical practice and patient care,      information and communication technologies and (logistic) structuring of health      care and health care processes. The program comprises core education (60 EC),      discipline-related in-depth-study (12 EC) and an academic work placement (48 EC).      Students from a range of other disciplines will be admitted to the master program      after successful completion of an individualized conversion program (a maximum of      30 EC). CONCLUSIONS: With the new set-up of our master course and by offering      individualized conversion programs, we hope to both accommodate the learning      needs of our own medical informatics baccalaureates and to attract other     (international) students and professionals to our new program. Our ultimate aim      is to bring forth medical informatics specialists who can make significant      contributions to the field.

PMID- 17452122   - BACKGROUND: Health care professionals' collaboration is highly important for the       medical practice. Efficient exchange of information improves good cooperation,      but remains complex, due to the diversity of the medical activities. Currently,      the health record is mainly used to manage structured medical information. On the      one hand, such structure supports treatment that requires the documented      information. On the other hand, however, the structure also imposes constraints      on narrative and conversational practices of health care professionals. They use       other collaboration means through phone, mail, annotations and free texts for     informal strategies of communication. We focussed on informal written documents.       Two different studies provided us some materials: home care charts in the context      of home care and annotations in the context of the hospital health records.      PURPOSES: We wanted to design a model of the Communication Notes to computerize      the written notes so as to improve the communication and the coordination of the       practitioners. METHODS: We compared the results of the two studies about the      various writing strategies used by the health care professionals to keep traces      of their exchanges and of their acts. The first study deals with the information       mentioned by the nurses in a chart during home care situations. We analysed the      distribution of cooperation activities in action and in planning. The second      study deals with the annotations which are written by all the practitioners to      complete the documents of the health record in a paediatric ward. We analysed how      annotations take part in their collaborations. RESULTS: We found some invariable       items in these two situations and we proposed a model for these Communication      Notes which can be used to describe and to index them according to different      points of view. Some indications on the way such descriptions are used in current      computerized systems are also reported. The originality of this model comes from       the way it takes into account a collaborative perspective which is not often used      in the electronic medical settings. CONCLUSIONS: With our model of Communication       Notes, we now dispose of a promising setting for managing all the informal and      unforeseeable information produced by the health care professionals during care.

PMID- 17434338   - In spite of their name, 'ubiquitous' technologies are not yet ubiquitous in the      true sense of the word, but rather are 'novel', being at the research, pilot, and      selective use stages. In future, the proliferation in types of application, the      major increase in cases and data volumes, and above all the dependence on      ubiquitous technologies to monitor persons at risk, will raise practical,      ethical, and liability issues. Equally significantly, it will require health      service redesign, including new response services. Health informaticians need to       be active in stimulating consideration of all these issues, as part of both      social and professional responsibility.

PMID- 17434337   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a secure web-based patient portal called      Patient Gateway (PG) in producing more accurate medication lists in the      electronic health record (EHR), and whether sending primary care physicians      (PCPs) a clinical message updating them on the information their patients      provided caused physicians to update the EHR medication list. METHODS: We      compared the medication list accuracy of 84 patients using PG with that of 79 who      were not. Patient-reported medication discrepancies were noted in the EHR in a      clinical note by research staff and a message was sent to the participants' PCPs       notifying them of the updated information. RESULTS: Participants were taking 665       medications according to the EHR, and reported 273 additional medications. A      lower percentage of PG users' drug regimens (54% versus 61%, p=0.07) were      reported to be correct than those of PG non-users, although PG users took      significantly more medications than their non-user counterparts (5.0 versus 3.1      medications, p=0.0001). Providing patient-reported information in a clinical note      and sending a clinical message to the primary care doctor did not result in PCPs       updating their patients' EHR medication lists. CONCLUSIONS: Medication lists in      EHRs were frequently inaccurate and most frequently overlooked over-the-counter     (OTC) and non-prescription drugs. Patients using a secure portal had just as many      discrepancies between medication lists and self-report as those who did not, and       notifying physicians of discrepancies via e-mail had no effect.

PMID- 17409016   - PURPOSE: Implementation of evidence-based techniques, such as explicit      computerized protocols, has achieved limited success among clinicians. In this      study, we describe the development and validation of an instrument for assessing       clinicians' perceptions about use of explicit computerized protocols. METHODS:      Qualitative assessment of semi-structured interviews with clinicians gave rise to      a cognitive model evaluating the factors that motivate clinicians to use explicit      computerized protocols. Using these constructs we developed a 35-item instrument       which was administered to 240 clinicians (132 nurses, 53 physicians and 55      respiratory therapists), in three health-care institutions. RESULTS: Factor     analysis identified nine factors that accounted for 66% of the total variance      cumulatively. Factors identified were: Beliefs regarding Self-Efficacy,      Environmental Support, Role Relevance, Work Importance, Beliefs regarding      Control, Attitude towards Information Quality, Social Pressure, Culture, and      Behavioral Intention. The strongest predictor was Beliefs regarding      Self-Efficacy, which accounted for 26% of the total variance of intention to use       explicit computerized protocols. Results supported the reliability and construct       validity of the instrument. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians' perceptions play a critical       role in determining their intention to use explicit computerized protocols in      routine clinical practice. Behavioral theories will help us understand factors      predicting clinicians' intention to use explicit computerized protocols and      recognize the implications of these factors in the design and implementation of      these protocols.

PMID- 17407747   - In this special issue on virtual biomedical universities and e-learning we will      make a survey on the principal existing teaching applications of ICT used in      medical Schools around the world. In the following we identify five types of      research and experiments in this field of medical e-learning and virtual medical       universities. The topics of this special issue goes from educational computer     program to create and simulate virtual patients with a wide variety of medical      conditions in different clinical settings and over different time frames to using      distance learning in developed and developing countries program training medical       informatics of clinicians. We also present the necessity of good indexing and      research tools for training resources together with workflows to manage the      multiple source content of virtual campus or universities and the virtual digital      video resources. A special attention is given to training new generations of      clinicians in ICT tools and methods to be used in clinical settings as well as in      medical schools.

PMID- 17398145   - PURPOSE: To improve contact isolation rates among patients admitted to the      hospital with a known history of infection with Methicillin-resistant      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). METHODS:      A before and after interventional study implementing computerized reminders for     contact isolation between February 25, 2005 and February 28, 2006. We measured      rates of appropriate contact isolation, and time to isolation for the 4 month      pre-intervention period, and the 12 month intervention period. We conducted a      survey of ordering physicians at the midpoint of the intervention period.      RESULTS: Implementing a computerized reminder increased the rate of patients      appropriately isolated from 33% to fully 89% (P<0.0001). The median time to      writing contact isolation orders decreased from 16.6 to 0.0 h (P<0.0001).      Physicians accepted the order 80% of the time on the first or second      presentation. Ninety-five percent of physicians felt the reminder had no impact      on workflow, or saved them time. CONCLUSION: A human reviewed computerized      reminder can achieve high rates of compliance with infection control      recommendations for contact isolation, and dramatically reduce the time to orders      being written upon admission.

PMID- 17392019   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the feasibility and usefulness      of expressing clinical data sets (CDSs) as openEHR archetypes. For this, we      present an approach to transform CDS into archetypes, and outline typical      problems with CDS and analyse whether some of these problems can be overcome by      the use of archetypes. METHODS: Literature review and analysis of a selection of       existing Australian, German, other European and international CDSs; transfer of a      CDS for Paediatric Oncology into openEHR archetypes; implementation of CDSs in      application systems. RESULTS: To explore the feasibility of expressing CDS as      archetypes an approach to transform existing CDSs into archetypes is presented in      this paper. In case of the Paediatric Oncology CDS (which consists of 260 data      items) this lead to the definition of 48 openEHR archetypes. To analyse the      usefulness of expressing CDS as archetypes, we identified nine problems with CDS       that currently remain unsolved without a common model underpinning the CDS.      Typical problems include incompatible basic data types and overlapping and      incompatible definitions of clinical content. A solution to most of these      problems based on openEHR archetypes is motivated. With regard to integrity      constraints, further research is required. CONCLUSIONS: While openEHR cannot      overcome all barriers to Ubiquitous Computing, it can provide the common basis      for ubiquitous presence of meaningful and computer-processable knowledge and      information, which we believe is a basic requirement for Ubiquitous Computing.      Expressing CDSs as openEHR archetypes is feasible and advantageous as it fosters       semantic interoperability, supports ubiquitous computing, and helps to develop      archetypes that are arguably of better quality than the original CDS.

PMID- 17369081   - PURPOSE: A substantial fraction of the observations made by clinicians and      entered into patient records are expressed by means of negation or by using terms      which contain negative qualifiers (as in "absence of pulse" or "surgical      procedure not performed"). This seems at first sight to present problems for     ontologies, terminologies and data repositories that adhere to a realist view and      thus reject any reference to putative non-existing entities. Basic Formal      Ontology (BFO) and Referent Tracking (RT) are examples of such paradigms. The      purpose of the research here described was to test a proposal to capture negative      findings in electronic health record systems based on BFO and RT. METHODS: We      analysed a series of negative findings encountered in 748 sentences taken from 41      patient charts. We classified the phenomena described in terms of the various      top-level categories and relations defined in BFO, taking into account the role      of negation in the corresponding descriptions. We also studied terms from      SNOMED-CT containing one or other form of negation. We then explored ways to      represent the described phenomena by means of the types of representational units      available to realist ontologies such as BFO. RESULTS: We introduced a new family       of 'lacks' relations into the OBO Relation Ontology. The relation lacks_part, for     example, defined in terms of the positive relation part_of, holds between a      particular p and a universal u when p has no instance of u as part. Since p and u      both exist, assertions involving 'lacks_part' and its cognates meet the      requirements of positivity. CONCLUSION: By expanding the OBO Relation Ontology,      we were able to accommodate nearly all occurrences of negative findings in the      sample studied.

PMID- 17369080   - BACKGROUND: For more than two decades, Epi Info software has been used to meet      the data management, analysis, and mapping needs of public health professionals      in more than 181 countries and 13 languages. Until now, most Epi Info systems      have been relatively simple, mainly because of a lack of detailed and structured       guidance for developing complex systems. OBJECTIVE AND RESULTS: We created the      structured application framework for Epi Info (SAFE), which is a set of      guidelines that allows developers to create both simple and complex information      systems using accepted good programming practices. This has resulted in      application code blocks that are re-useable and easy to maintain, modify, and      enhance. The flexibility of SAFE allows various aggregate and case-based      application modules to be rapidly created, combined, and updated to create health      information systems or sub-systems enabling continuous, incremental enhancement      as national and local capacity increases. CONCLUSIONS: SAFE and Epi Info are both      cost-free and have low system requirements--characteristics that render this      framework and software beneficial for developing countries.

PMID- 17363323   - BACKGROUND: Appropriate pain assessment is a necessary prerequisite for adequate       pain control. A way to follow-up on the pain is to let patients use paper-based      or electronic pain diaries. PURPOSE: The aim was to explore and describe      palliative home care patients' experiences of assessing their pain by using a      pain diary together with digital pen and mobile Internet technology. METHODS: A      system for the follow-up of pain treatment was developed and evaluated by means      of a qualitative cross-case content analysis. From December 2002 until September       2003 12 palliative patients, who initially assessed VAS pain>or=35 mm (VAS 0-100       mm), used the system. Patients reported their momentary pain intensity and the      number of consumed extra doses of analgesics three times per day. Analysis data      were collected from interviews with patients and spouses, questionnaires, medical      records, and the system log. RESULTS: In spite of severe illness and difficulties      in comprehending the technology and system intervention, patients found the pain       diary and digital pen easy to use for pain assessment. Patients took a greater     part in their own care and experienced an improved contact with their caregivers,      which led to a sense of increased security. The medical records showed a quick      response to variations in the patients' health status by means of changes in      medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The pain assessment system for palliative      patients using pain diaries together with digital pen and wireless Internet      technology constitutes an effortless method and has positive influences on the      care.

PMID- 17344092   - The " Universite Medicale Virtuelle Francophone" (UMVF) is a federation of French      medical schools. Its main goal is to share the production and use of pedagogic      medical resources generated by academic medical teachers. We developed an      Open-Source application based upon a workflow system, which provides an improved       publication process for the UMVF. For teachers, the tool permits easy and      efficient upload of new educational resources. For web masters it provides a      mechanism to easily locate and validate the resources. For librarian it provide a      way to improve the efficiency of indexation. For all, the utility provides a      workflow system to control the publication process. On the students side, the      application improves the value of the UMVF repository by facilitating the      publication of new resources and by providing an easy way to find a detailed      description of a resource and to check any resource from the UMVF to ascertain      its quality and integrity, even if the resource is an old deprecated version. The      server tier of the application is used to implement the main workflow      functionalities and is deployed on certified UMVF servers using the PHP language,      an LDAP directory and an SQL database. The client tier of the application      provides both the workflow and the search and check functionalities. A unique      signature for each resource, was needed to provide security functionality and is       implemented using a Digest algorithm. The testing performed by Rennes and Lille      verified the functionality and conformity with our specifications.

PMID- 17336141   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an electronic prescribing and integrated drug      information system was more likely to be used by primary care physicians for     patients of low socioeconomic (SES) patients. METHODS: Prospective 9 months      follow-up study was conducted in Montreal, Canada from March to November 2003.      The study included 28 primary care physicians and their 4096 respective patients       with provincial drug insurance. Utilization rate was defined as the number of      times the electronic medication history (EMH) and electronic prescribing system      (E-rx) were accessed divided by the total number of medical visits made by those       patients. System audit trails (utilization), provincial health insurance      databases (visits) were used to measure system utilization rate. For each patient      neighborhood-based measures of household income, derived from Statistics Canada,       were used to measure socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The EMH was used 14.5 times      per 100 visits. In comparison to high SES patients, there was a significant 70%      increase (RR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.15-2.47) in the EMH utilization for low SES      patients. The electronic prescribing system was used 38.5 times per 100 visits      and did not vary by patient SES. The EMH utilization rate for low SES patients      with multiple emergency room (ER) visits was 2.4 times higher than for high SES      patients with <1 ER visit (RR: 2.38; 95%CI: 1.36-4.14). The utilization rate for       low SES patients, who took, at least six drugs per day, was four times higher     compared to high SES patients with less complex drug management (RR: 4.00; 95%CI:      2.22-7.17). CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians were more likely to access      electronic information on current drug use for patients of low SES taking      multiple medications and with fragmented care.

PMID- 17331800   - PURPOSE: Clear and adequate communication between physicians is essential in      modern medicine. Nevertheless, the medical curricula in The Netherlands lack an      identifiable part in their education concerning inter-physician communication      training. To train medical students in inter-physician communication skills using      the Dynamic Patient Simulator (DPS), the Academic Medical Center at the      University of Amsterdam and the Leiden University Medical Center joined in a      2-year project sponsored by the Dutch government. DPS is an educational computer       program to create and simulate virtual patients with a wide variety of medical      conditions in different clinical settings and over different time frames. To      evaluate whether DPS is a suitable method for training medical students in      inter-physician communication, we assessed if medical students felt that they had      improved their inter-collegial communication skills after the pilot with DPS.      Besides, we inquired students on DPS' usability and their satisfaction with DPS.       METHODS: We first developed and implemented 20 patient simulations in DPS to be      practiced upon by two students asynchronously during a week. These students were       situated in different medical institutions, geographically spread over The      Netherlands and had to treat the virtual patient as a team supported by DPS. The       students had to report their findings and treatment plan in the electronic      referral form of DPS. A total of 134 students participated in the pilot. To      evaluate inter-physician communication training using DPS we conducted a survey      amongst these students who were entering their internships. The evaluation      focused on self-assessment of their communication skills, usability of the DPS      program, and their satisfaction with DPS as educational format, using multiple      questionnaires. DISCUSSION: The outcome of the evaluation showed significant      progression in students' feeling of improvement of their skills in different      aspects concerning the referral of a patient after participating in the pilot.      Besides, students evaluated the usability of DPS positive and were highly      satisfied with the education in inter-physician communication training using DPS.      Based on these outcomes, nowadays this form of training is incorporated in the      curricula on a regular basis.

PMID- 17331799   - Continuing education of healthcare professionals is a key element for the quality      and efficiency of a health system. In developing countries, this activity is      usually limited to capitals, and delocalized professionals do not have access to       such opportunities, or to didactic material adapted to their needs. This limits      the interest of such professionals to remain active in the periphery, where they       are most needed to implement effective strategies for prevention and first-line      healthcare. Telemedicine tools enable the communication and sharing of medical      information in electronic form, and thus facilitate access to remote expertise. A      physician located far from a reference center can consult its colleagues remotely      in order to resolve a difficult case, follow a continuous education course over     the Internet, or access medical information from digital libraries or knowledge      bases. These same tools can also be used to facilitate exchanges between centers       of medical expertise: health institutions of a same country as well as across      borders. Since 2000, the Geneva University Hospitals have been involved in      coordinating the development of a network for eHealth in Africa (the RAFT, Reseau      en Afrique Francophone pour la Telemedecine), first in Mali, and now extending to      10 French-speaking African countries. The core activity of the RAFT is the      webcasting of interactive courses. These sessions put the emphasis on knowledge      sharing across care professionals, usually in the form of presentations and      dialogs between experts in different countries. The technology used for the      webcasting works with a slow (25 kbits/s) internet connection. Other activities      of the RAFT network include visioconferences, teleconsultations based on the      iPath system, collaborative knowledge bases development, support for medical      laboratories quality control, and the evaluation of the use of telemedicine in      rural areas (via satellite connections) in the context of multisectorial      development. Finally, a strong emphasis is put on the development of capacities      for the creation, maintenance, and publication of quality medical didactic      contents. Specific courses are organized for the national coordinators of the      network to develop these competencies, with the help of the Health-On-the-Net      Foundation. The richness of the plurality of knowledge and know-how must be      steered towards emulation and sharing, respectful of each partner's identity and       culture. Collaborations with UNESCO and WHO have been initiated to address these       challenges.

PMID- 17324620   - PURPOSE: Documentation of medical treatment and observation of patients during      evacuation from the point of injury to definitive treatment is important both for     optimizing patient treatment and managing the evacuation process. The current      practice in military medical field documentation uses paper forms and voice      communication. There are many shortcomings associated with this approach,      especially with respect to information capture and sharing processes. Current      research addresses the use of new technology for civilian ambulance-to-hospital      communication. The research work presented in this article addresses information       capture and sharing in extreme military conditions by evaluating a targeted      computerized information system called EvacSys during a military exercise in      northern Norway in December 2003. METHODS AND MATERIALS: EvacSys was designed and      implemented in close cooperation with military medical personnel in both Norway      and the USA. The system was evaluated and compared to the traditional paper-based      documentation method during a military exercise. The on-site evaluation was      conducted in a military medical platoon in the Norwegian Armed Forces, using      questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, observation and video recording to      capture the users' system acceptance. RESULTS: A prototype software system      running on a commercial off-the-shelf hardware platform was successfully      developed. The evaluation of this system shows that the usability of digital      information capturing and sharing are perceived to be at least as good as the      traditional paper-based method. The medics found the new digital method to be      more viable than the old one. No technical problems were encountered.      CONCLUSIONS: Our research shows that it is feasible to utilize digital      information systems for medical documentation in extreme outdoor environments.      The usability concern is of utmost importance, and more research should be put      into the design and alignment with existing workflow. Successful digitalization      of information at the point of care will provide accurate and timely information       for the management of resources during disaster response.

PMID- 17321199   - BACKGROUND: Children with acute abdominal pain (AP) are frequently assessed in      the Emergency Department (ED). Though the majority of patients have benign      causes, uncertainty during the physician's initial assessment may result in      unnecessary tests and prolonged observation before a definitive disposition      decision can be made. A rule-based mobile clinical decision support system,      Mobile Emergency Triage-Abdominal Pain (MET-AP), has been developed to recommend       an appropriate triage plan (discharge, consult surgery or observe/investigate)      early in the ED visit, with the goal of promoting ED efficiencies and improved      patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of MET-AP to       recommend the correct triage plan when used during the initial assessment by      staff emergency physicians (EPs) and residents in a tertiary care pediatric ED.      DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. Staff EPs and/or residents examined children,      aged 1-16 years, with acute, non-traumatic AP of less than 10 days duration.      Details of their initial assessment, along with their blinded prediction of the      correct triage plan, were recorded electronically. Inter-observer assessments      were collected, where possible. Telephone and chart follow-up at 10-14 days was      conducted to determine the patient's outcome/diagnosis, and thus the gold      standard triage plan appropriate for the patient's visit. MEASUREMENTS: Accuracy       of MET-AP to recommend the correct triage plan (i.e., to match the gold standard       plan); accuracy of physicians to predict the correct triage plan; inter-observer       agreement between staff EPs and residents for each clinical attribute recorded      within MET-AP. RESULTS: Over 8 months, 574 patients with AP completed follow-up      (10% appendicitis, 13% other pathology, 77% benign/resolving conditions). For     patient assessments by the staff EP (n=457), the MET-AP recommendation was      correct for 72% of patients (95% CI's: 67.9-76.1), while the physician's      prediction was correct in 70% of cases (65.9-74.2) (p=0.518). However, staff EP      triage plans were more conservative than those generated by MET-AP, and a small      number of patients whose triage plan should have been "consult surgery" would      have been "discharged" by MET-AP. For resident assessments (n=339), MET-AP and      physician accuracies were slightly lower, but not statistically different from      staff results or from each other. Inter-observer agreement on most attributes was      moderate to near perfect. CONCLUSION: MET-AP shows promise in recommending the      correct triage plan with similar overall accuracy to experienced pediatric EPs,      but requires further research to improve accuracy and safety. MET-AP can be used       on all pediatric ED patients with AP and is capable of producing a triage plan      recommendation without requiring a complete set of patient information.

PMID- 17321198   - The UMVF project is a federation of medical teaching resources covering 32      medical schools in France. Today, the indexing of these resources is carried out       manually by the CISMeF team at the University Hospital of Rouen. This indexing is      based on MeSH thesaurus. We use a subset of SCORM metadata standard. This choice       was defined in collaboration with the French Medical Virtual University      consortium (French acronym: UMVF). Currently, with the UMVF searching tool      (called Doc'UMVF), medical students can reach more than 3300 resources useful in       their curriculum. Doc'UMVF is developed in close collaboration between the      medical informatics laboratories of Rennes and Rouen. In this paper we present      two complementary searching tools based on different methods and which are      integrated and used to improve both the relevance and the coverage rate of the      answers. A specific searching module has been built to retrieve specific      resources concerning the National Medical Exam ENC ("Examen National Classant")      is also available. Nevertheless, due to lack of time, numerous resources are not       yet indexed. Therefore we have decided to use also automatic indexing method      (Nomindex). This approach will be improved by further research works, resulting      from Rouen and Geneva teams. After having built a searching meta-motor, our     objective is to develop a meta-tool intended to index the whole set of digital      pedagogical resources produced by the UMVF framework. This manual re-indexing      will be carried out only for the most important resources (national references),       with a more or less fine granularity.

PMID- 17317292   - BACKGROUND: The Internet is increasingly used for health matters including Ask      the doctor services. AIM: To describe users and usage pattern of text-based      medical consultation with family physicians on the Internet. METHODS: Descriptive      analysis of the first 4 years' use of a Swedish Ask the doctor service concerning      number of inquiries, age and gender of inquirers. Time of day and week, types of       medical inquiries, and use in relation to population density was analyzed during       the last year of the study. RESULTS: We found a considerable number of users,      with 38,217 inquiries submitted to the service. Three-fourths of the inquirers      were women, thus exceeding the gender difference seen in regular health care. The      typical user was a woman aged 21-60 years. The service was used any time day or     night, 7 days a week. Almost half of the inquiries were submitted during evenings      and nights. Most areas of medicine were represented in the inquiries, reflecting       the fact that there was no control of what an inquiry should include. The use was      widespread over the country but more frequent per capita in more densely      populated areas as defined by postal code. CONCLUSION: In the study of a service       for text-based consultations with family physicians on the Internet, we found a      geographically widely distributed use, slowly but gradually increasing during a      4-year period. The use increased more rapidly among young and middle-aged women.       Asynchronous text-based consultation is likely to expand in the near future.

PMID- 17317291   - OBJECTIVE: Determine whether agreement among annotators improves after being      trained to use an annotation schema that specifies: what types of clinical      conditions to annotate, the linguistic form of the annotations, and which      modifiers to include. METHODS: Three physicians and 3 lay people individually      annotated all clinical conditions in 23 emergency department reports. For     annotations made using a Baseline Schema and annotations made after training on a      detailed annotation schema, we compared: (1) variability of annotation length and      number and (2) annotator agreement, using the F-measure. RESULTS: Physicians      showed higher agreement and lower variability after training on the detailed      annotation schema than when applying the Baseline Schema. Lay people agreed with       physicians almost as well as other physicians did but showed a slower learning      curve. CONCLUSION: Training annotators on the annotation schema we developed      increased agreement among annotators and should be useful in generating reference      standard sets for natural language processing studies. The methodology we used to      evaluate the schema could be applied to other types of annotation or     classification tasks in biomedical informatics.

PMID- 17307030   - This paper describes a new distributed Master of Science degree program stream in      health informatics (HI) at the University of Victoria, Canada, aimed at      healthcare and information technology professionals working in the health      setting. This is a part-time graduate program where students are required to      complete 10 courses and a research project for the degree over 2 years. The      course delivery is through a mixture of real-time virtual classes, asynchronous      online forums/resources, two capstone courses each summer as a 2-week intensive      on-campus workshop, and a major workplace related field research project.      Examples of innovation include the use of Web-based conferencing for real-time      virtual classes, simulated tele-debriefing for policy/decision makers, roundtable      sessions with chief information officers, modularized professional development      courses, and joint field research project oversight with employers. The paper     then discusses the need to refine the program/course offering to ensure its      consistency to current HI curriculum and competency standards, pleas for a      coordinated approach to HI capacity building in Canada, and outlines planned next      steps for the School in the coming year.

PMID- 17296325   - OBJECTIVES: There is an increasing need for a larger and better trained workforce      in medical informatics. The goal of the American Medical Informatics Association       10x10 program is to educate 10,000 clinicians in medical informatics by the year       2010. METHODS: We adapted an on-line introductory graduate course toward this      goal. It was evaluated using Likert-scale and open-ended questions. RESULTS: The       course was successfully implemented and attracted 51 individuals, 44 of whom      completed it. The evaluation was generally positive, with all but one      Likert-scale above 4.0 on a 1-to-5 scale. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully adapted an      introductory medical informatics course to a larger audience. The evaluation      showed it was received positively and we have further plans to scale it to an      even larger audience to meet the goals of the 10x10 program.

PMID- 17291828   - PURPOSE: The French National Blood Transfusion Institute received approval from      the French National Health Authority to organize a nationwide program for the      evaluation of professional practices in the area of blood transfusion. Major     issues of the project were: (1) managing numerous physicians spread nationwide;      (2) tracking and storing the physician's entire process (from his/her enrollment       to his/her lifelong follow-up); (3) creating a collaborative technique for     processing an evaluation program; (4) enhancing exchanges between participants;      (5) proposing effective implementation of the assessment. METHODS: As faculty      members with experience in distance learning, we considered the      digital/electronic portfolio to be one of the most suitable techniques to support      such a project. Due to the lack of methods and tools to meet users' expectations,      the decision was made to prototype a new and innovative assessment environment. A      team was formed to complete the design phase within 6 months (information      content, roles and functions). Implementation of the prototype, which includes      tests, was also planned over a 6-month period. The methodology involves two      approaches: one concerns business process modelling; the other is related to      object-oriented methods for design and implementation. RESULTS: This primary work      was aimed at describing a specific object, the evaluation program, which can be      shared between players within a web-based collaborative platform. Four types of      players were identified: (1) physicians enrolled into the assessment program; (2)      tutors assigned to follow physicians' assessment process; (3) program directors      who manage the content of the assessment program and the application of follow-up      rules; (4) supervisors who administrate the global system. The evaluation program      is composed of a set of actions, which has to be performed by the physicians.      These actions are directly related to the activities of the business processes to      which the candidate belongs. For each action, elements of proof have to be      uploaded by the physician, according to a predefined schedule. The status of this      object and its changes are followed and managed by a workflow engine.      Implementation of the system required an object-oriented content management      system (Zope/Plone). CONCLUSION: The object-oriented approach helped us to focus       on the topic of interest, the assessment program, without being concerned by the       whole environment. The assessment model we designed attempts to make a link with       the business process performed in daily routine. This article explores the way      business process modelling can contribute to the modelling of a professional      practices assessment system. Apart from the modelling and technical aspects, this      nationwide project contains major challenges: to enroll all physicians on an      individualized basis and to create appropriate conditions for the extension of      the evaluation program and device to other specialties.

PMID- 17289429   - OBJECTIVES: As international scientific collaboration increases, there is a      growing requirement for research data to be comparable among countries. Despite      the importance of medication and dietary supplement data in research, there are      no international standards for the collection and storage of these data. In the      absence of such standards, we needed to adopt a strategy for classification and      coding of medications and dietary supplements to meet demands of our     multi-national study. METHODS: Given the inter-country variations in nomenclature      that characterize prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, traditional      herbal medicines, and dietary supplements, we adopted RxNorm as a data standard      for medication data, and developed an independent system that extends this      standard and allows for flexible and scalable data collection for dietary      supplements. RESULTS: RxNorm was implemented in May 2005 and as of July 2006,      coverage has been 99%, at the level of active ingredients, of all the medications      reported in our study. Development of a dietary supplement database began in      August 2005, and has thus far coded some 1200 dietary supplements and 650 infant       formula products and forms from the four countries in our study. CONCLUSION: The       methods we have used to collect, store, and manage medication and dietary      supplement data serve as interim solutions until international standards are      developed. It is hoped that such standards will ultimately emerge, and that our     strategy and data model will be of value in other research environments in the      immediate future.

PMID- 17224303   - PURPOSE: To inform about the impact of a recent movement towards a policy to      develop integrative networked electronic health record (EHR) as a basis for     cooperation among care teams and with patients and in support of safe patient      care in Japan. METHODS: The author headed a commission developing policy for     health record (HR) structure and its computerization. It executed two      questionnaire surveys as the basis for its work. One survey assessed the current       state of computerization of health record in the hospitals certified by Japan      Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC). The other survey assessed the attitudes       towards a specific EHR system in the Hiroshima University Hospital and its      affiliate hospitals. RESULTS: The survey of the above hospitals showed that most       have computer supported administrative procedures, but only few computer-based      health records. The attitudes of the Hiroshima EHR users show that while they      expect efficiency and quality improvements, there is also apprehension that the      system in use might lower practical efficiency and compromise patient safety.      Accordingly, health recording requirements and storage policy have been      restructured and communicated to the hospitals. CONCLUSION: These insights led to      the initiation of curricula educating "Health Information Technologist" which is       promoted by Japan Association Medical Informatics and the criterion of Chart      Review Promotion of JCQHC. They will also lead to recommendation for improved and      advanced EHR.

PMID- 17218149   - OBJECTIVES: To describe the perceptions and behaviour in accessing health      information from the Internet by women attending a BreastScreen, New South Wales       (NSW) Service in Northern Sydney. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A      BreastScreen NSW Service in Northern Sydney. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behaviour and      perceptions of accessing of the Internet for breast health and screening      information and other related health information. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and       fifteen women aged > or =40 years who had a screening mammogram at a BreastScreen      NSW Service in Northern Sydney. Data were collected from 1 October to 22 December     2004 (study interval). RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-one eligible women were      invited to participate in the study and of these 415 women agreed to participate       in the study (participation rate=90%). Of the 415 women enrolled in the cohort,      80% (333/415) of women accessed the Internet in general and 62% (205/333) of the       women who accessed the Internet also accessed health related information from the      Internet, but only 7% of the total women accessed breast health and screening      information from the Internet. Two hundred and eighty (70%) women in the cohort      expressed their intention to access the Internet if they were diagnosed with      breast cancer. Age (OR=0.94; 95% CI=0.91-0.97), marital status (OR=2.65; 95%      CI=1.45-4.83), educational status (OR=3.26; 95% CI=1.77-6.02) and behavioural      intention of accessing the Internet if diagnosed with breast cancer (OR=3.31; 95%      CI=1.83-5.98) were found to be associated with access of Internet for general      information. Furthermore, behavioural intention (OR=2.43; 95% CI=1.30-4.55),      rating of computer skills as 'average' (OR=0.42; 95% CI=0.22-0.79) and 'not good       to poor' (OR=0.23; 95% CI=0.11-0.49) were found to be associated with access of      health related information from the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: Information searching       from the Internet is common among women having a screening mammogram. There is      potential to provide guidance to women regarding accessing the BreastScreen NSW      website and other reliable sources of Internet information on breast health,      breast screening and cancer-related information.

PMID- 17208516   - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the use patterns of a Persian web-based patient      education system for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in Iran. METHODS:       A web-based patient education system was developed with Persian content in three       sections: general, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD). The website      included a forum for patients to communicate as a self-help group. A customized      web tracking system recorded web use statistics. Polls at the bottom of each page      collected the visitors' opinion on the extent of helpfulness and readability of      page contents. Web use data were analyzed for an 18-month period from October     2004 to April 2006. RESULTS: Having excluded page visits from search engine      robots, the website's homepage was visited 4452 times (mean of monthly visits:      234, range: 102-330). The web pages titled Anatomy of gastrointestinal system,      Nutrition in IBD, Diagnostic tests, How to cope with IBD, and IBD in women were      the most favorite in general section. The web page titled IBD treatment was the      most visited in both CD and UC sections followed by the web pages on cause of      disease, diagnostic procedures and complications in CD section; and those titled       symptoms, cause of disease and risk factors in the UC section. Overall, the      content evaluation polls received 294 hits (from 186 unique visitors) of which,      196 (67%) were from patients, 30 (10%) from patients' relatives/friends, 21 (7%)       from doctors, and 47 (16%) from other groups. During the 18-month period, 47      patients registered in the self-help forum, 24 threads were opened, and 97 posts       (33 in CD and 64 in UC section) were sent. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the      increasing trend of Internet use in developing countries like Iran, and the      consequent increase in the proportion of Internet-using patients, and finally the      time constraints gastroenterologists face answering patients' questions; similar       websites seem to be effective ways of patient education in close future.

PMID- 17208041   - PURPOSE: Computerized Decision Support Systems have been shown to improve      clinicians' performance. Clinicians' adoption of these systems is crucial for     their success. Studying clinicians' perceptions can provide an insight into the      determinants of clinicians' adoption of such systems. The aim of this study was      to measure clinicians' perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of a web-based      antibiotic approval system, and to investigate the relationship between the      reported perceptions and use of the system. METHODS: Potentially identifiable      coded surveys were sent to a total of 70 senior and 150 junior medical staff, and      30 pharmacists all working at a tertiary care referral teaching hospital of      Melbourne, Australia. Clinicians' perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of      the antibiotic approval system; clinicians' general computer use; and clinicians'      usage of the antibiotic approval system were measured. RESULTS: The overall      response rate from the clinicians was 53.4%. The majority of the participants      (70% and above) found it easy to obtain antibiotic approval using the system.      More than 80% of the participants believed that the system will decrease the      inappropriate use of antibiotics at the hospital. Clinicians who were more likely      to use the system also found it easy to learn (Rho=0.392, p=0.001), easy to show       others how to use the system (Rho=0.298, p=0.014), easy to find additional      information (Rho=0.317, p=0.009), and easy to use it within their daily workflow       (Rho=0.268, p=0.028). In addition, the clinicians were also more likely to use      the system if they believed that it will improve their adherence to      evidence-based practice (Rho=0.352, p=0.003). CONCLUSION: The majority of      clinicians in an independent investigation of the antibiotic approval system      found the system easy to use and useful to them. A number of clinicians'      perceptions about the system were found to be correlated with the actual usage of      the system by the clinicians.

PMID- 17208040   - OBJECTIVE: To obtain an overview of study designs and study methods used in      research evaluating IT in health care, to present a list of quality criteria by      which all kinds of reported evaluation studies on IT systems in health care can      be assessed, and to assess the quality of reported evaluation studies on IT in      health care and its development over time (1982-2005). METHODS: A generic 10-item      list of quality indicators was developed based on existing literature on quality       of medical and medical informatics publications. It is applicable to all kind of       IT evaluation papers and not restricted to randomized controlled trials. One      hundred and twenty explanatory papers evaluating the effects of an IT system in      health care published between 1982 and 2005 were randomly selected from PubMed,      the study designs and study methods were extracted, and the quality indicators      were used to assess the quality of each paper by two independent raters. RESULTS:      The inter-rater variability of scoring the 10 quality indicators as assessed by a      pre-test with nine papers was good (K=0.87). There was a trend towards more      multi-centre studies and authors coming more frequently from various departments.      About 70% of the studies used a design other than a randomized controlled trial      (RCT). Forty percent of the studies combined at least two different data      acquisition methods. The quality of IT evaluation papers, as defined by the      quality indicators, was only slightly improving in time (Spearman correlation      coefficient [rs]=0.19). The quality of RCTs publications was significantly higher     than the quality of non-RCT studies (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The continuous and      dominant number of non-RCT studies reflects the various approaches applicable to       evaluate IT systems in health care. Despite the increasing discussion on      evidence-based health informatics, the quality of published evaluation studies on      IT interventions in health care is still insufficient in some aspects. Journal      editors and referees should take care that reports of evaluation on IT systems      contain all aspects needed for a sufficient understanding and reproducibility of       a paper. Publication guidelines should be developed to support more complete and       better publications of IT evaluation papers.

PMID- 17204451   - OBJECTIVE: We present an integrated set of technologies, known as the Hippocratic      Database, that enable healthcare enterprises to comply with privacy and security       laws without impeding the legitimate management, sharing, and analysis of      personal health information. APPROACH: The Hippocratic Database approach to      securing electronic health records involves (1) active enforcement of      fine-grained data disclosure policies using query modification techniques, (2)      efficient auditing of past database access to verify compliance with policies and      track security breaches, (3) data mining algorithms that preserve privacy by      randomizing information at the individual level, (4) de-identification of      personal health data using an optimal method of k-anonymization, and (5)      information sharing across autonomous data sources using cryptographic protocols.      CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirms that policies concerning the disclosure of      electronic health records can be reliably and efficiently enforced and audited at      the database level. We further demonstrate that advanced data mining and      anonymization techniques can be employed to analyze aggregate health records      without revealing individual patient identities. Finally, we show that web      services and commutative encryption can be used to share sensitive information      selectively among autonomous entities without compromising security or privacy.

PMID- 17194621   - INTRODUCTION: Speech recognition is currently being deployed in medical and      anaesthesia applications. This article is part of a project to investigate and      further develop a prototype of a speech-input interface in Danish for an      electronic anaesthesia patient record, to be used in real time during operations.      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the experiment is to evaluate the relative impact of      several factors affecting speech recognition when used in operating rooms, such      as the type or loudness of background noises, type of microphone, type of      recognition mode (free speech versus command mode), and type of training.      METHODS: Eight volunteers read aloud a total of about 3600 typical short      anaesthesia comments to be transcribed by a continuous speech recognition system.      Background noises were collected in an operating room and reproduced. A      regression analysis and descriptive statistics were done to evaluate the relative      effect of various factors. RESULTS: Some factors have a major impact, such as the      words to be recognised, the type of recognition and participants. The type of      microphone is especially significant when combined with the type of noise. While       loud noises in the operating room can have a predominant effect, recognition      rates for common noises (e.g. ventilation, alarms) are only slightly below rates       obtained in a quiet environment. Finally, a redundant architecture succeeds in      improving the reliability of the recognitions. CONCLUSION: This study removes      some uncertainties regarding the feasibility of introducing speech recognition      for anaesthesia records during operations, and provides an overview of the      interaction of several parameters that are traditionally studied separately.

PMID- 17188928   - BACKGROUND: The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools      for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics      researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate      strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular, the collection      of methods known as 'data mining' offers methodological and technical solutions      to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models.       A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may       help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools,      construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of      predictive models within clinical environments. PURPOSE: The goal of this review       is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining       and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing      and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine. METHODS: We review the      recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical       medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of      learned lessons. RESULTS: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state       of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to      carry out data mining studies in this field. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive data mining       is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in      medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the      application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their     deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of      molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has      recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems      it needs to address.

PMID- 17188564   - BACKGROUND: Information technology can support the delivery of healthcare.      Patients are eager to make use of such tools as web messaging, yet its deployment      has been limited to date. A fear still pervades that the cost associated with a      possible increase to physician workloads may outweigh any suggested benefits.      GOAL: This paper aims to review the body of research completed in the area of      patient-physician web messaging. The findings of this review will then be      assessed and synthesised, with the intention of creating an overview of both the       benefits and costs of patient-physician online messaging. Areas of particular     importance to future research may then be identified. RESULTS: Demand and support      for online communication tools amongst patients is strong, and can increase      quality of care due to increased patient-physician communication. Although there       would seem to be great potential to increase process efficiency, there would not       seem to be sufficient evidence as of yet to suggest that this is the case.      CONCLUSION: Further quantitative research in particular is required to assess the      impact of online communication, with special regard to the effect on overall      patient demand and on healthcare process efficiency.

PMID- 17185030   - OBJECTIVE: Reliability of diagnoses coding is essential for the use of routine      data in a national health care system. The present investigation compares      reliability of diagnoses coding with ICD-10 between three groups of coding      subjects. METHOD: One hundred and eighteen students coded 15 diagnoses lists, 27       medical managers from hospitals 34 discharge letters, and 13 coding specialists      12 discharge letters. Agreement in principal diagnosis was assessed using Cohen's      Kappa and the fraction of coincidences over the number of pairs, agreement for     the full set of diagnoses with a previously developed measure p(om). RESULTS:      Kappa values were fair (managers) or moderate (coders) for terminal codes with      0.27 and 0.42 (agreement 29.2% versus 46.8%), substantial for the chapter level      with 0.71 and 0.72 (agreement 78.3% versus 80.8%). p(om) was lower for the full      set of diagnoses than for principal diagnoses, for example in case of managers      with 0.21 versus 0.29 for terminal codes. Best results were achieved by students       coding diagnoses lists. In summary, the results are remarkably lower than in      earlier publications. CONCLUSION: The refinement of the ICD-10 accompanied by      innumerous coding rules has established a complex environment that leads to      significant uncertainties even for experts. Use of coded data for quality      management, health care financing, and health care policy requires a remarkable      simplification of ICD-10 to receive a valid image of health care reality.

PMID- 17174147   - The design and development of information systems should focus on a wider context      than merely one user group or organization. This is particularly the case with      systems integration. A tentative description of the activity network, information      needs, and user requirements should be acquired before any major changes are      planned. Relatively rapid yet participatory methods are needed at this      preliminary stage. In this article, we claim that activity theory offers a      suitable framework for this. Subsequently, we present a qualitative study in      which this approach was used, with focus on the practices of the information      management within a maternity care activity network. The first aim was to elicit       the most important integration needs in the existing information systems of      Finnish maternity clinics. Secondly, we wanted to introduce a participatory      approach to be utilized by the service-providing organizations themselves, rather     than software companies or quality consultants. Data were collected in      multi-professional group interviews. The results include information needs and      communication problems as well as outlines for solutions in the systems      integration of maternity clinics. Various tools of information management do not       meet the concrete needs of health care work. Integration is needed on many      levels, and it has to be adapted to the needs of numerous stakeholders. The      applied activity-theoretical framework proved useful in describing such a      multi-faceted system of information and its users. More research is needed on its      wider applicability, particularly in situations where researchers are not active       participants.

PMID- 17161649   - INTRODUCTION: This paper reports the findings of an evaluation study in the field      of human-computer interaction about the use of a new data acquisition device, the      digital pen. It focuses on specific aspects of the interaction between the users       and the technology: the cognitive burden induced by the design of the tool in      real conditions of use and its impact on user acceptance. METHODOLOGY: Human      cognition is embedded in a complex sociocultural world. Therefore, we opted for     ethnographically informed investigations reinforced by a satisfaction survey. The      work context chosen for these investigations was the emergency room triage      process. RESULTS: The technology meets a high acceptance (median 3 on a [-5,5]      scale) shaded by unexpected additional cognitive burdens. These burdens originate      in several technological and ergonomic flaws that have been discovered during the      observations. These results have been used to improve the technology. CONCLUSION:      We demonstrate the importance of this kind of field study to uncover unexpected      possible sources of failure of acceptance of a new technology. Such kind of study      should be held prior to the introduction of a new technology to lower the common       failure rate encountered in the field of medical informatics.

PMID- 17157553   - OBJECTIVE: Problems with multidisciplinary team conferences in health care      include the exchange of too much (discipline-specific) information. The aim of      this study was to investigate the effect of the implementation of a      rehabilitation tool on the contents of communication during multidisciplinary      team conferences in a rheumatology setting. METHODS: All initial and follow-up      team conferences of 25 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis admitted to      a day patient care ward were videotaped during a period before (period I) and      after (period II) the introduction of a rehabilitation tool. The aims of the      rehabilitation tool were to enhance discussions on the co-ordination of care      rather than merely exchange of information. This was achieved by providing a      framework for the setting and evaluation of common treatment goals and management      strategies as well as accompanying electronic and printed records. For every team      conference, the duration of time spent on three types of communication was      recorded: (1) grounding regarding the patient's health status, (2) the making of       practical arrangements by no more than two health professionals, and (3) the      co-ordination of common treatment goals or management strategies. Comparisons of       the proportions of time spent on the different types of communication between the      two periods were done by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Apart from      the 25 initial team conferences in both periods, 86 and 71 follow-up team      conferences were available in periods I and II, respectively. Regarding the      initial team conferences, the proportion of time spent on grounding and practical      arrangements was significantly smaller in period II than in period I. In      addition, the proportion of time spent on common goals or management strategies      was significantly greater in period II than in period I. For the follow-up team      conferences, the proportion of time spent on practical arrangements was      significantly smaller in period II, than in period I. Moreover, the proportions      of time spent on the other types of communication did not differ significantly      between the two periods. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a rehabilitation tool       including a computer application increased the proportion of time spent on the      discussion of common treatment goals or management strategies during initial but       not during follow-up team conferences in a day patient rheumatology clinic.

PMID- 17137833   - OBJECTIVES: To determine doctors' reasons for using the Internet, and the factors      that influence their usage. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of 38 studies, from      1994 to 2004, describing surveys of doctors' Internet usage. RESULTS: All of the       studies were in the developed world, primarily in North America. Approximately      60-70% of doctors have access to the Internet, but in several studies access is      more than 90%. Access is steadily increasing. Most Internet activity focuses on      email and searching in journals and databases, but there is a very wide range of       activities. Professional email with colleagues and patients is low, but      increasing. The major factors discouraging usage are time, workload and cost,      while too much information, liability issues and lack of skills also feature as      discouraging factors. Factors encouraging use are unclear, but overall patient      satisfaction and belief in improved service delivery, time saving and demand from      patients are factors. There is a trend that males use the Internet more than      females, young more than old, and specialists more than generalists, but these      differences are not across the board, and show variations between studies.      CONCLUSION: In spite of the limitations, it is clear that doctors are highly      connected to the Internet, and their professional usage is increasing. Factors      encouraging and discouraging usage are more complex than simple connectivity.      Usage differences between demographic groups do exist, but are equalising. More      and consistent research is required in this area.

PMID- 17126596   - Although other alternatives may exist, identification cards have been chosen as      an acceptable and adequate tool to be used to identify patients and health      professionals. It is planned to use these for digital signature and for access to      electronic health records: for searching various databases as well as for health       information exchange. Local applications might exist independently, but the      Belgian federal state has now developed Be-Health, a platform for health      professionals, social security personnel and the general public, designed to      facilitate a secure common uniform access to certain health data.

PMID- 17126069   - PURPOSE: Health managers, administrators and health practitioners now face new      challenges due to the increasing dependency being placed on electronic health      information systems. This paper focuses on Electronic Health Records for     determining the critical attributes for e-health system development. The proposed      QUiPS model aims to provide a framework for building trustworthy solutions by      identifying the pertinent issues needed to determine the risk exposure with a      given system. APPROACH: To produce dependable, low risk and viable IT solutions,       each critical attribute needs to be specifically addressed and prioritized. It is      shown how these attributes possess a number of interdependencies making the      analysis and prioritization tasks complex and hence, in practice, often      incomplete. Two Australian case studies are presented that access enterprise      level applications of live health records where these risk based techniques have       been applied. RESULTS: The value and the shortcomings of taking a risk based      approach to developing and deploying electronic health information systems that      are safe and secure, is evaluated. The case studies presented indicate that      traditional methods used to derive the requirements are often inadequate and the       risks that are faced in ensuring a safe and secure system are highly application       dependent and dynamic. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence towards a viable universal      solution for our electronic health records is not imminent and trust in e-health       is fragile. Policies that data custodians follow need to be flexible and updated       on a regular basis. Technological solutions are at best a stop gap to avoid the      common hazards associated with access control and secure messaging. A wider range      of analysis techniques to determine the key issues for a dependable health      information system can derive longer term sustainable solutions.

PMID- 17118701   - The healthcare industry is moving from paper-based documentation into the digital      era. Electronic health records (EHR) are playing a major role in this      development. Electronic health records will not only to be shared among a growing      number of healthcare providers but they have also to be archived over long      periods of time. The required life cycle depends of national regulations, but      typically the preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years.       Availability, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of stored data over       these lengthy preservation periods needs to be fully proven, both to preclude      loss and also ensure the ability to read and understand content is maintained.      This document describes a co-operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which      receives granular health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together     with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes granular     EHR-data objects. TNA communicates with EHR-systems and external users via      archive request and distribution messages. TNA can store objects in XML-format      and prove the non-repudiation and integrity of stored data with the help of event      records, Time-stamps and archive e-signatures.

PMID- 17118700   - Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) and web service technologies have been      proposed to respond to some central interoperability challenges of heterogeneous       health information systems (HIS). We propose a model which we are using to define      services and solutions for healthcare applications from the requirements in the      healthcare processes. Focusing on the transition from the process level of the      model to the application level, we also present some central design      considerations, which can be used to guide the design of service-based      interoperability. We illustrate these aspects with examples from our current work      from the service-enabled HIS.

PMID- 17113824   - OBJECTIVE: Modeling is a significant part of research, education and practice in       biomedical and health informatics. Our objective was to explore which types of      models of processes are used in current biomedical/health informatics research,      as reflected in publications of scientific journals in this field. Also, the      implications for medical informatics curricula were investigated. METHODS:      Retrospective, prolective observational study on recent publications of the two      official journals of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA),      the International Journal of Medical Informatics (IJMI) and Methods of      Information in Medicine (MIM). All publications of the years 2004 and 2005 from      these journals were indexed according to a given list of model types. Random      samples out of these publications were analysed in more depth. RESULTS: Three      hundred and eighty-four publications have been analysed, 190 of IJMI and 194 of      MIM. For publications in special issues (121 in IJMI) and special topics (132 in       MIM) we found differences between theme-centered and conference-centered special       issues/special topics (SIT) publications. In particular, we could observe a high       variation between modeling in publications of theme-centered SITs. It became      obvious that often sound formal knowledge as well as a strong engineering      background is needed for carrying out this type of research. Usually, this      knowledge and the related skills can be best provided in consecutive B.Sc. and      M.Sc. programs in medical informatics (respectively, health informatics,      biomedical informatics). If the focus should be primarily on health information      systems and evaluation this can be offered in a M.Sc. program in medical      informatics. CONCLUSIONS: In analysing the 384 publications it became obvious      that modeling continues to be a major task in research, education and practice in      biomedical and health informatics. Knowledge and skills on a broad range of model      types are needed in biomedical/health informatics.

PMID- 17113345   - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of using an audiovisual animation (i.e.,      digital video) displayed on a personal digital assistant (PDA) for patient      education in a clinical setting. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study of a      prospective technology intervention conducted in an outpatient infectious      diseases clinic at an academic medical center. Subjects responded to questions      immediately before, immediately after, and 4-6 weeks after watching a digital      video on a PDA. Outcome measures include participant knowledge of disease,      knowledge of medications, and knowledge of adherence behaviors; attitudes toward       the video and PDA; self-reported adherence; and practicality of the intervention.      RESULTS: Fifty-one English-speaking adults who were initiating or taking      medications for the treatment of HIV/AIDS participated in the study. At visit      one, statistically significant improvements in knowledge of disease (p<0.005;      paired t-test), knowledge of medications (p<0.005; paired t-test), and knowledge       of adherence behaviors (p<0.05; ANOVA) were measured after participants watched      the PDA-based video. At visit two (4-6 weeks later), statistically significant      improvements in self-reported adherence to the medication regimens (p<0.005;      paired t-test) were reported. Participants liked the PDA-based video and      indicated that it was an appropriate medium for learning, regardless of their     baseline literacy skills. The video education process was estimated to take 25      min of participant time and was viewed in both private and semi-private      locations. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-assisted education using a digital video      delivered via PDA is a convenient and potentially powerful way to deliver health       messages. The intervention was implemented efficiently with participants of a      variety of ages and educational levels, and in a range of locations within      clinical environments. Additional study of this methodology is warranted.

PMID- 17112779   - PURPOSE: In order to better understand physicians' perspectives about the use of       clinical information technology (CIT) to reduce medical errors, we asked      physicians about opportunities and issues around clinical use of computerized      physician order entry (CPOE) systems, order sets within CPOE, and handheld      computers (HHCs). METHODS: We conducted 10 focus groups including 71 physicians      involved in technology implementation efforts across the US between April 2002      and February 2005. RESULTS: Two major themes emerged across focus groups around      reliance on CIT to reduce errors: (1) can it work? and (2) at what cost to the      medical profession? Within the first theme, physicians expressed concern about      the appropriateness of physician-directed CIT as a solution for medical errors,      concerns regarding the current technical capabilities and level of technical      support for CIT solutions, and concern about the introduction of new errors.      Within the second theme, physicians were particularly concerned about time      efficiency and workload redistribution associated with the introduction of CIT.      Across focus groups, physicians tended to generalize about the role of all IT in       their lives, potentially biasing opinions about specific technologies.      CONCLUSIONS: Health care organizations attempting to promote physician use of CIT      are advised to deepen consideration of physicians' perspectives about technology       adoption and use in order to address their concerns, reduce skepticism, and      increase the likelihood of implementation success.

PMID- 17110161   - OBJECTIVE: Interruptions are known to have a negative impact on activity      performance. Understanding how an interruption contributes to human error is      limited because there is not a standard method for analyzing and classifying      interruptions. Qualitative data are typically analyzed by either a deductive or     an inductive method. Both methods have limitations. In this paper, a hybrid      method was developed that integrates deductive and inductive methods for the      categorization of activities and interruptions recorded during an ethnographic      study of physicians and registered nurses in a Level One Trauma Center.      Understanding the effects of interruptions is important for designing and      evaluating informatics tools in particular as well as improving healthcare      quality and patient safety in general. METHOD: The hybrid method was developed      using a deductive a priori classification framework with the provision of adding       new categories discovered inductively in the data. The inductive process utilized      line-by-line coding and constant comparison as stated in Grounded Theory.      RESULTS: The categories of activities and interruptions were organized into a      three-tiered hierarchy of activity. Validity and reliability of the categories      were tested by categorizing a medical error case external to the study. No new      categories of interruptions were identified during analysis of the medical error       case. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study provide evidence that the hybrid      model of categorization is more complete than either a deductive or an inductive       method alone. The hybrid method developed in this study provides the methodical      support for understanding, analyzing, and managing interruptions and workflow.

PMID- 17098467   - PURPOSE: To introduce the goals of EAV database modeling, to describe the      situations where entity-attribute-value (EAV) modeling is a useful alternative to      conventional relational methods of database modeling, and to describe the fine      points of implementation in production systems. METHODS: We analyze the following      circumstances: (1) data are sparse and have a large number of applicable      attributes, but only a small fraction will apply to a given entity; (2) numerous       classes of data need to be represented, each class has a limited number of      attributes, but the number of instances of each class is very small. We also      consider situations calling for a mixed approach where both conventional and EAV       design are used for appropriate data classes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In robust       production systems, EAV-modeled databases trade a modest data sub-schema for a      complex metadata sub-schema. The need to design the metadata effectively makes      EAV design potentially more challenging than conventional design.

PMID- 17097916   - The interconnection of medical networks in different healthcare institutions will      be constantly increasing over the next few years, which will require concepts for     securing medical data during transfer, since transmitting patient related data      via potentially insecure public networks is considered a violation of data      privacy. The aim of our work was to develop a model-based approach towards      end-to-end security which is defined as continuous security from point of origin       to point of destination in a communication process. We show that end-to-end      security must be seen as a holistic security concept, which comprises the      following three major parts: authentication and access control, transport      security, as well as system security. For integration into existing security      infrastructures abuse case models were used, which extend UML use cases, by      elements necessary to describe abusive interactions. Abuse case models can be      constructed for each part mentioned above, allowing for potential security risks       in communication from point of origin to point of destination to be identified      and counteractive measures to be directly derived from the abuse case models. The      model-based approach is a guideline to continuous risk assessment and improvement      of end-to-end security in medical networks. Validity and relevance to practice      will be systematically evaluated using close-to-reality test networks as well as       in production environments.

PMID- 17097915   - INTRODUCTION: Papyrus manuscripts nearly 2000 years old, can still be read, but      documents composed on a Wang or other word processor just 30 years ago are gone      forever. Standards and formats used for storing and accessing information are      constantly changing, and the required hardware or software will likely be      obsolete or no longer exist in the near future. PURPOSE: To understand how to      urgently address the data preservation issue as we migrate to greater use of      e-records, in particular 'lifetime' electronic health records (EHR's), as our     primary, perhaps sole, e-record. In principle, these dynamic and critical health       data must be preserved and capable of real-time access on a 7/24/365 basis for     perhaps 125 years. Without forethought, only a small fraction of the data      currently stored within any healthcare jurisdiction will survive for more than a       decade or so, or be exchangeable between jurisdictions. The situation will only      be compounded as EHR's become ubiquitous. APPROACH: The literature was reviewed      to identify data preservation issues and potential solutions, and guide      development of policy recommendations to minimise the impact of this potentially       catastrophic system failure. These recommendations are directed at the practice,       program, and decision-making levels, and in both the public and private sectors.       CONCLUSION: Data preservation poses a critical barrier to e-health and future      healthcare systems. At this time broad awareness of data preservation issues is      poor. This paper offers policy recommendations to stimulate debate and      development of suitable strategies.

PMID- 17085069   - The French Ministry of Health is setting up the personal medical record (PMR or     DMP for Dossier Medical Personnel in French). This innovating tool is highly      expected and will be extremely useful for the therapeutic follow-up as well as      for epidemiological studies on which public health policies are based. Therefore       the currently planned identifying process should prevent any epidemiological use       of these data. Numerous scientific organisations have alerted government powers      about the threat that this impairment represents, and they wish to promote some      secure procedures that exist, which have already proved their efficiency at the      national and international level.

PMID- 17084665   - e-Health, as an inter-jurisdictional enterprise, presents risks to patient health      data that involve not only technology and professional protocols but also laws,      regulations and professional security cultures. The USA Patriot Act is one      example of how national laws can shape these concerns. Secure e-Health therefore       requires not only national standardization of professional education and      protocols but also global interoperability of regulations and laws. Some progress      in this regard has been made in the European context; however, even here      developments are incomplete, and nothing similar has been accomplished on a      global scale. Professional health information organizations must take the lead in      developing appropriate high-level principles for professional certification and      security protocols and in harmonizing these on a global basis, so that they can      provide a firm and consistent foundation for international treaties. Such      developments should occur in concert with other health professions, so that      coordinated requirements are integrated into revisions of the relevant codes of      ethics. This presentation identifies and addresses some of the ethical and legal       issues and proposes a series of recommendations.

PMID- 17084664   - OBJECTIVE: To explore how the implementation of a comprehensive new      bioinformatics analysis system would affect workflow, collaboration and      information management in a small genetic research lab. DESIGN: This was a      longitudinal qualitative study of seven individuals involved in genomic and      proteomic research. The study data were gathered using the      illuminative/responsive approach of immersion in the environment. Additional      qualitative data were gathered using informal semi-structured interviews,      participant observation in lab meetings, and direct observation of lab      researchers engaged in specific tasks. MEASUREMENTS: Interview, observation and      field note data were coded and analyzed based on three analysis perspectives. A      subset of the data was independently evaluated by an external researcher to      enhance the trustworthiness of results. RESULTS: Three reoccurring themes were      observed in the study. (1) Satisfaction and acceptance of software tools tended      to be role and goal specific. (2) The system was seen primarily as a measurement       system rather than a "total laboratory analysis system". (3) Lab meetings      deemphasized the system, preferring more traditional data analysis techniques.      These themes support the observations that the system was not used to its full      potential in the lab. CONCLUSION: Themes identified in this study suggest that      sophisticated genetic researchers face similar problems of technology      implementation as do professionals in other fields. We recommend that leadership       support and on-going training and evolution of academic curricula can improve      chances of bioinformatics analysis systems becoming used more effectively.

PMID- 17084663   - BACKGROUND: A system ensuring tight control access is used since 5 years at the      University Geneva Hospitals (HUG) over a four campuses health care system with      ambulatory care settings behaving like a small community care network. Access to       identified clinical information is limited to care providers that have a      therapeutic relationship with the patient and to those data needed for that      relation. The same policy applies to administrative or scientific research      accesses. This paper presents how the HUG met the challenging goal of protecting       patient privacy within regulatory limits while keeping the system operational in       terms of use and management. SOLUTION: The main characteristics of the system      are: (a) an institution-wide policy for access rights to the computerized patient      record; (b) an institutional management of the contracts of the collaborators;      (c) access profiles based on application-independent, fine-grained access rights;      (d) a decentralized attribution of profession-specific access profiles; (e) a      complete, centralized log of all accesses to the clinical information system; and      (f) a decentralized verification of the accesses. Many of these characteristics      can be maintained when evolving towards a trans-institutional computerized      patient record, but new constraints need to be taken into account.

PMID- 17084662   - PURPOSE: In many countries there are initiatives for building an integrated      patient-centric electronic health record. There are also initiatives for     transnational integrations. These growing demands for integration result from the      fact that it can provide improving healthcare treatments and reducing the cost of      healthcare services. While in European highly developed countries computerisation      in healthcare sector began in the 1970s and reached a high level, some developing      countries, and Serbia among them, have started computerisation recently. This is       why MEDIS (MEDical Information System) is aimed at integration itself from the      very beginning instead of integration of heterogeneous information systems on a      middle layer or using HL7 protocol. APPROACH: The implementation of a national      healthcare information system requires using standards as integrated and widely      accepted solutions. Therefore, we have started building MEDIS to meet the      requirements of CEN ENV 13606 and CEN ENV 13729 standards. The prototype version       has a distributed component-based architecture with modern security solutions      applied. MEDIS has been implemented as a federated system where the central      server hosts basic EHCR information about a patient, and clinical servers contain      their own part of patients' EHCR. RESULTS: At present, there is an initial      version of prototype planned to be deployed at first in a small community. In      particular, open source API for X.509 authentication and authorisation has been      developed. Our project meets the requirements for education in health      informatics, including appropriate knowledge and skills on EHCR. The points      included in this article have been presented on several national conferences and       widely discussed. CONCLUSION: MEDIS has explored a federated, component-based      EHCR architecture and related security aspects. In its initial version it shows      acceptable performances and administrative simplicity. It emphasizes the      importance of using standards in building EHCR in our country, in order to      prepare it for future integrations.

PMID- 17081800   - PURPOSE: From the Hippocratic Oath to the World Medical Association's Declaration      of Geneva, physicians have sworn to protect patients' privacy. However, as      systems move to more integrated architectures, protecting this medical data      becomes more of a challenge. The increase in complexity of IT environments, the      aggregation of data, and the desire of other entities to access this data, often       24 h/day x 7 day/week x 365 day/year, is putting serious strains on our ability      to maintain its security. This problem cuts across all electronic record sources       from patient care records to academic medical research records. APPROACH: In      order to address this issue, we are rethinking the way we store, transmit,      process, access, and federate patient data from clinical and research      applications. Our groups at the University of Michigan are developing a system      called the "Honest Broker" to help manage this problem. The Honest Broker will      offload the burden of housing identifiable data elements of protected health      information (PHI) (e.g., name and address) as well as manage data transfer     between clinical and research systems. Lab results and other non-identifiable      data will be stored in separate systems with either a research study ID or     clinical ID number. This two-component architecture increases the burden on      attackers who now need to compromise two systems, one of which is seriously      hardened, in order to match health data with a patient's actual identity.      CONCLUSIONS: While no security system is truly intrusion-proof, this architecture      provides a high security choke point reducing the likelihood of a breach. By      redesigning the method of integrating clinical care and research, we have enabled      projects that would be cost prohibitive to conduct otherwise. The scalability of       this mechanism is dependant on nature of the heterogenous nature of the clinical       systems serving patients.

PMID- 17074532   - OBJECTIVES: The healthcare systems of all developed countries face the challenge       for improving quality, efficiency and safety of patients' care. For meeting this       challenge, health is moving from being organisation-centred to process-based      care. This process will continue in the future turning health towards      person-centred architectures. This system transformation is combined with      extended and advanced communication and collaboration supported and enabled by      appropriate information and communication technologies (ICT), also called      e-health. The resulting solutions have to be trustworthy. METHODS: There is a set      of security services needed for realising trustworthy e-health solutions. Those      security services must be comprehensively integrated in the e-health application.      Furthermore, a set of infrastructure services has to be specified and      implemented. For keeping the solutions future-proof, they have to comply with      architectural principles and paradigms. RESULTS: After shortly introducing      meanwhile internationally acknowledged architectural paradigms for applications,       means and infrastructures providing security services, existing, or specified      advanced solutions are described and compared. In that context, the Electronic      Health Record as e-health core application has been especially considered. Based       on published work as well as on explored solutions, the security services needed       are summarised and evaluated. The pros and cons of investigated examples are      collected and interpreted. In that context, especially the German health      telematics framework architecture and security infrastructure and the      corresponding implementable solutions on the one hand and the USA Veterans Health      Administration approach to security have been carefully considered. CONCLUSION:      Processes and systems are determined by policies, which define and distinguish      constraints for communication and collaboration. Therefore, formally modelling      policies and performing policy bridging are the main challenges to be met. As      result of investigations, recommendations have been derived for establishing the       trustworthiness required for any e-health solution at different level from      regional to national, European, and even global scale, which are included in the       conference summary.

PMID- 17070728   - PURPOSE: The National Health Service's (NHS's) National Programme for Information      Technology (NPfIT) in the UK with its proposed nation-wide online health record      service poses serious technical challenges, especially with regard to access      control and patient confidentiality. The complexity of the confidentiality      requirements and their constantly evolving nature (due to changes in law,      guidelines and ethical consensus) make traditional technologies such as      role-based access control (RBAC) unsuitable. Furthermore, a more formal approach       is also needed for debating about and communicating on information governance, as      natural-language descriptions of security policies are inherently ambiguous and      incomplete. Our main goal is to convince the reader of the strong benefits of      employing formal policy specification in nation-wide electronic health record      (EHR) projects. APPROACH: Many difficulties could be alleviated by specifying the      requirements in a formal authorisation policy language such as Cassandra. The      language is unambiguous, declarative and machine-enforceable, and is based on      distributed constrained Datalog. Cassandra is interpreted within a distributed      Trust Management environment, where digital credentials are used for establishing      mutual trust between strangers. RESULTS: To demonstrate how policy specification       can be applied to NPfIT, we translate a fragment of natural-language NHS      specification into formal Cassandra rules. In particular, we present policy rules      pertaining to the management of Clinician Sealed Envelopes, the mechanism by      which clinical patient data can be concealed in the nation-wide EHR service. Our       case study exposes ambiguities and incompletenesses in the informal NHS      documents. CONCLUSIONS: We strongly recommend the use of trust management and      policy specification technology for the implementation of nation-wide EHR     infrastructures. Formal policies can be used for automatically enforcing      confidentiality requirements, but also for specification and communication      purposes. Formalising the requirements also reveals ambiguities and missing      details in the currently used informal specification documents.

PMID- 17067851   - The purpose of this article is to explore the need for the possibility to      reconstruct electronic medical data, in particular the electronic health record      (EHR) as they have been or could have been presented to a specified health care      professional at a specified moment in the past. The approach taken is that first       the need for such functionality is discussed with attention to the differences      between electronic records and paper records in this respect. Next the      architectural and technical consequences of the implementation of the      functionality are considered. The article concludes that such functionality is      needed for medical audit, self assessment and handling of complaints. It further       concludes that it is far from easy to implement the functionality. If the health       care community underwrites the need for such functionality this will have a      significant impact on the architecture of medical information systems and the      (distributed) EHR. It is recommended that the professional associations and the      governments, in collaboration with WHO, take a position on the need to be able to      reconstruct the contents of the EHR. IMIA could take the lead in that process.

PMID- 17064955   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Information technology such as electronic medical records      (EMRs), electronic prescribing and decision support systems are recognized as      essential tools in Europe, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. But      significant barriers impede wide-scale adoption of these tools, especially EMR     systems. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate the present      status of information technology in health care, the perceived benefits and      barriers by primary care physicians. METHODS: Literature analysis and survey data      from primary care physicians on adoption of information technology are reviewed.       RESULTS: The U.S. trails European countries as well as Canada, Australia and New       Zealand in the use of information technology in primary care. The results of the       study indicate that physicians in general perceive benefits to information      technology, but also cite major barriers to its implementation in their     practices. These barriers include lack of access to capital by health care      providers, complex systems and lack of data standards that permit exchange of      clinical data, privacy concerns and legal barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming these      barriers will require subsidies and performance incentives by payers and      government; certification and standardization of vendor applications that permit       clinical data exchange; removal of legal barriers; and greater security of      medical data to convince practitioners and patients of the value of EMRs.

PMID- 17059892   - Several studies have shown that there is information loss during interruptions,      and that multitasking creates higher memory load, both of which contribute to      medical error. Nowhere is this more critical than in the emergency department      (ED), where the emphasis of clinical decision is on the timely evaluation and      stabilization of patients. This paper reports on the nature of multitasking and      shift change and its implications for patient safety in an adult ED, using the      methods of ethnographic observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using      grounded theory to study cognition in the context of the work environment.      Analysis revealed that interruptions within the ED were prevalent and diverse in       nature. On average, there was an interruption every 9 and 14 min for the      attending physicians and the residents, respectively. In addition, the workflow      analysis showed gaps in information flow due to multitasking and shift changes.      Transfer of information began at the point of hand-offs/shift changes and      continued through various other activities, such as documentation, consultation,       teaching activities and utilization of computer resources. The results show that       the nature of the communication process in the ED is complex and cognitively      taxing for the clinicians, which can compromise patient safety. The need to      tailor existing generic electronic tools to support adaptive processes like      multitasking and handoffs in a time-constrained environment is discussed.

PMID- 17055778   - PURPOSE: To investigate whether the long-term preservation of the authenticity of      electronic healthcare records (EHR) is possible. To propose a mechanism that      enables the secure validation of an EHR for long periods, far beyond the lifespan      of a digital signature and at least as long as the lifetime of a patient.      APPROACH: The study is based on the fact that although the attributes of data      authenticity, i.e. integrity and origin verifiability, can be preserved by      digital signatures, the necessary period for the retention of EHRs is far beyond       the lifespan of a simple digital signature. It is identified that the lifespan of      signed data is restricted by the validity period of the relevant keys and the      digital certificates, by the future unavailability of signature-verification      data, and by suppression of trust relationships. In this paper, the notarization       paradigm is exploited, and a mechanism for cumulative notarization of signed EHR       is proposed. RESULTS: The proposed mechanism implements a successive trust      transition towards new entities, modern technologies, and refreshed data,      eliminating any dependency of the relying party on ceased entities, obsolete      data, or weak old technologies. The mechanism also exhibits strength against      various threat scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: A future relying party will have to trust       only the fresh technology and information provided by the last notary, in order     to verify the authenticity of an old signed EHR. A Cumulatively Notarized      Signature is strong even in the case of the compromise of a notary in the chain.

PMID- 17049917   - OBJECTIVE: With growing demand for health information and rapid development of      information technology, health information websites are emerging as the most      effective media to meet the public's needs for health information. This article      is intended to offer a technical view on the design and operations of health      information websites. Along this line, employed here is the Technology Acceptance      Model (TAM), which has been widely used to predict user acceptance based on      Perceived Ease-of-Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU). METHODS: We extend      the original TAM by including some exogenous variables since it is necessary to      understand the role of the antecedents of acceptance constructs when designing an      effective health information website for improving user satisfaction. This study       focuses on identifying the core functional factors in designing and operating      health information websites. Conducted are some multivariate statistical analyses      based on data from an extensive survey. RESULTS: The results from the structural       equation analysis suggest that functional characteristics should be categorized      into three groups: one affecting PU and PEOU, another affecting only PEOU, and      the other having no direct effect on either PU or PEOU. In particular, 'usage      support' and 'customization' are two key functional characteristics in the      extended TAM framework for health information websites. CONCLUSION: Contrary to      expectations, however, the direct effect of PEOU on usage support is hardly      observed, which differentiates health information websites from other commercial       websites like online shopping malls. As a result, understanding the antecedents      of PU takes on more significance.

PMID- 17035080   - Due to its complexity intensive care is vulnerable to errors. On the ICU adults      of the AMC (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) the available registries used for error     reporting did not give insight in the occurrence of unwanted events, and did not       lead to preventive measures. Therefore, a new registry has been developed on the       basis of a literature study on the various terms and definitions that refer to      unintended events, and on the methods to register and monitor them. As this      registry intends to provide an overall insight into errors, a neutral term      ('incident') -- which does not imply guilt or blame -- has been sought together     with a broad definition. The attributes of an incident further describe the      unwanted event, but they should not form an impediment for the ICU nurses and      physicians to report. The properties of a registry that contribute to making it      accessible and user friendly have been determined. This has resulted in an      electronic registry where incidents can be reported rapidly, voluntarily,      anonymously and free of legal consequences. Evaluation is required to see if the       new registry indeed provides the ICU management with the intended information on       the current situation on incidents. For further refinement of the design,      additional development and adjustments are required. However, we expect that the       awareness of errors of the ICU personnel has already improved, forming the first       step to increased patient safety.

PMID- 17023201   - OBJECTIVES: The main objective is to create a knowledge-intensive coding support       tool for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10), which is based on       formal representation of ICD10 categories. Beyond this task the resulting      ontology could be reused in various ways. Decidability is an important issue for       computer-assisted coding; consequently the ontology should be represented in      description logic. METHODS: The meaning of the ICD10 categories is represented      using the GALEN Core Reference Model. Due to the deficiencies of its      representation language (GRAIL) the ontology is transformed to the quasi-standard      OWL. A test system which extracts disease concepts and classifies them to ICD10      categories has been implemented in Prolog to verify the feasibility of the      approach. RESULTS: The formal representation of the first two chapters of ICD10      (infectious diseases and neoplasms) has been almost completed. The constructed      ontology has been converted to OWL DL. The test system successfully identified      diseases in medical records from gastrointestinal oncology (84% recall, however     precision is only 45%). The classifier module is still under development. Due to       the experiences gained during the modelling, in the future work FMA is going to      be used as anatomical reference ontology.

PMID- 17018263   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present our perspectives on healthcare      information analysis at a conceptual level and the lessons learned from our     experience with the development of a terminology-based enterprise electronic      nursing record system - which was one of components in an EMR system at a      tertiary teaching hospital in Korea - using an object-oriented system analysis      and design concept. METHODS: To ensure a systematic approach and effective      collaboration, the department of nursing constituted a system modeling team      comprising a project manager, systems analysts, user representatives, an      object-oriented methodology expert, and healthcare informaticists (including the       authors). A rational unified process (RUP) and the Unified Modeling Language were      used as a development process and for modeling notation, respectively. RESULTS:      From the scenario and RUP approach, user requirements were formulated into use      case sets and the sequence of activities in the scenario was depicted in an      activity diagram. The structure of the system was presented in a class diagram.      CONCLUSION: This approach allowed us to identify clearly the structural and      behavioral states and important factors of a terminology-based ENR system (e.g.,       business concerns and system design concerns) according to the viewpoints of both      domain and technical experts.

PMID- 17015035   - In changing the context regarding the situation of vulnerable children in rural      South Africa, understanding the role of communication in the design of      community-based child health information systems (HIS) is key. Communication goes      beyond language. The importance of translation of terms and concepts used to      negotiate between different meanings and logics is explored in this paper. In      striving for the 'ideal speech situation' [J. Habermas, Structural Transformation      of the Public Sphere, The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1989], or, in other words,      creating an enabling environment in which people can participate in debate and      discussion on equal terms, there is a need to develop a codetermined vision; to      understand local meanings of and for childhood illness; to understand      communication systems and the context in which they occur; and to connect with      networks beyond the localised setting, such as provincial or national health      authorities. We provide a theoretical and practical framework in which important       aspects of communication related to IS design can be highlighted and against      which the implementation of an IS can be reviewed. The South African case study      from the UThukela District Child Survival Project in KwaZulu-Natal, illustrates      how this approach was used in co-constructing local meanings for child health      indicators in a community-based information system.

PMID- 17010664   - With the continued expansion of electronic patient record systems ahead of      comprehensive evidence, metrics, or future-proofing, health informatics in Europe      and beyond is embarking on a faith-driven adventure that also risks data swamping      of end-users. An alternative approach is an information broker system, drawing      from departmental data sources. A 3-year study in health and social care has      produced a first demonstrator which can search for specified information in      heterogeneous distributed data stores, with source-specific permission can copy      it, and then merge the search results into one integrated picture in a real-time       process which is also captured in an audit system. The research project has      addressed a number of issues during the study, including updating the concepts of      role-based access, semantic interoperability, and harnessing web-based services      bound at the time of need. A demonstrator now exists, and provides a platform for     further application and development research. This paper summarises how this      opens up a viable alternative approach for the next generation of health record      systems, enabling record searching and integration as and when it is needed for     specific patient-related purposes, whilst being independent of organisations,      diagnostic approaches, or service delivery structures, and reducing the risks of       data swamping.

PMID- 16997621   - In June 2003, a large, Canadian tertiary care facility introduced automatic drug       dispensing machines on all units when it opened up a new building. In this paper,      we provide an overview of the automatic drug dispensing system (ADS)      implementation at the hospital. Our findings, based on daily field observations      and interviews during and after implementation, with regular follow-up visits to       the field site illustrate how the introduction of the ADS brought to light work      practices that sometimes compromised patient safety. We suggest that utopian      views of automatic drug dispensing machines obfuscate the challenges inherent to       implementing such systems, and deter stakeholders from performing rigorous      evaluation of the costs (both social and economic) and benefits of investing in      such systems. Our work contributes to debates about the socio-technical efficacy       of automating medication dispensing and delivery, and suggests that the balance      of power in the patient safety equation lies in the work context and      implementation issues, and not just the technology. For technology      implementations to be successful considering that technologies frequently cross      over jurisdictional boundaries, planning and implementation have to be conducted       at a system wide level.

PMID- 16997620   - Technology and equipment are often identified as contributors to adverse medical       events, however technology is seldom the focal point of investigation as a source      of medical error or adverse event. It is often seen as both a means of reducing      error (e.g., automated drug dispensing machines) or as a major contributing      factor to adverse events (e.g., through cognitive overload). Here we review      literature about the governance of technology in health settings, which is      addressed in relation to patient safety. We outline the challenges of addressing       technology governance issues in the health sector, provide an overview of      governance processes, and suggest that technology related adverse events have      been largely conceptualized as device and user problems rather than system or     socio-technical problems, which is reflected in governance processes associated      with medical devices. A recognition of the situatedness of medical practices      implies that new forms of governance may be required that place greater emphasis       on socio-technical and systems issues.

PMID- 16996787   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method for systematically      planning patient records for structured data entry that can be used in      cooperative environments (e.g. cooperative care, multicenter trials) in a way      that enables multipurpose use and shared data entry. METHODS: Design research,      formal logic. RESULTS: The method suggests five steps: analyze the prevailing      documentation infrastructure, provide terminology management system (TMS),      provide documentation management system (DMS), plan the logical architecture,      provide all necessary tools. CONCLUSIONS: The era of eHealth enables cooperative       care and collaborative documentation. This can only be efficient if a multiple      use and shared entry of data is realized. The task of the medical informatics      community is to plan these environments systematically especially in complex      environments which are enabled by emerging technologies.

PMID- 16996299   - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of      a web-based depression stigma education tool for healthcare professionals.      METHODS: A web-based depression stigma program utilizing adult learning theories       was developed. Forty-two consecutive subjects were enrolled from University of      Maryland staff and graduate students. Primary outcomes were Bogardus Social      Distance Scale with a vignette on major depression disorder (BSDS-MDD) and the      Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) administered before and after the intervention.      RESULTS: Internet-based education significantly decreased the level of depression      stigma (BSDS-MDD 10.6+/-4.4 versus 7.2+/-4.4, p<0.001; DSS-personal 12.7+/-7.2      versus 7.8+/-5.3, p<0.001; DSS-perceived 21.7+/-5.5 versus 12.4+/-5.5, p<0.001).       After the educational intervention the subjects' knowledge about depression      significantly improved (pre-test DKS=18.2+/-8.2 versus post-test DKS=20.6+/-4.1,       p<0.001). The program was very well accepted by participants. For 100% of      participants, it was not difficult to operate the program. CONCLUSIONS:      Computer-assisted education was effective in reducing the stigma of depression      and increasing knowledge about depressive disorder. A web-based intervention has       the potential to be used for educating graduate students and university staff      about depression and for reducing depression stigmata. Healthcare professionals      interacting with people with stigmatizing conditions can benefit from web-based      computer education.

PMID- 16996298   - PURPOSE: Retrieving sufficient relevant information online is difficult for many       people because they use too few keywords to search and search engines do not      provide many support tools. To further complicate the search, users often ignore       support tools when available. Our goal is to evaluate in a realistic setting when      users use support tools and how they perceive these tools. METHODS: We compared      three medical search engines with support tools that require more or less effort       from users to form a query and evaluate results. We carried out an end user study      with 23 users who were asked to find information, i.e., subtopics and supporting       abstracts, for a given theme. We used a balanced within-subjects design and      report on the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the support tools from      the end user perspective. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in      efficiency but did not find significant differences in effectiveness between the       three search engines. Dynamic user support tools requiring less effort led to      higher efficiency. Fewer searches were needed and more documents were found per     search when both query reformulation and result review tools dynamically adjust      to the user query. The query reformulation tool that provided a long list of      keywords, dynamically adjusted to the user query, was used most often and led to       more subtopics. As hypothesized, the dynamic result review tools were used more      often and led to more subtopics than static ones. These results were corroborated      by the usability questionnaires, which showed that support tools that dynamically      optimize output were preferred.

PMID- 16971171   - OBJECTIVES: Virtual integration of distributed patient data promises advantages      over a consolidated health record, but raises questions mainly about      practicability and authorization concepts. Our work aims on specification and      development of a virtual shared health record architecture using a      patient-centred integration and authorization model. METHODS: A literature survey      summarizes considerations of current architectural approaches. Complemented by a       methodical analysis in two regional settings, a formal architecture model was      specified and implemented. RESULTS: Results presented in this paper are a survey       of architectural approaches for shared health records and an architecture model      for a virtual shared EHR, which combines a patient-centred integration policy      with provider-oriented document management. An electronic consent system assures,      that access to the shared record remains under control of the patient. A      corresponding system prototype has been developed and is currently being      introduced and evaluated in a regional setting. CONCLUSION: The proposed      architecture is capable of partly replacing message-based communications.      Operating highly available provider repositories for the virtual shared EHR     requires advanced technology and probably means additional costs for care      providers. Acceptance of the proposed architecture depends on transparently      embedding document validation and digital signature into the work processes. The       paradigm shift from paper-based messaging to a "pull model" needs further     evaluation.

PMID- 16962819   - OBJECTIVE: Both regional health information systems (rHIS) and hospital      information systems (HIS) need systematic information management. Due to their     complexity information management needs a thorough description or model of the      managed information system. METHODS: The three layer graph-based meta-model      (3LGM(2)) and the 3LGM(2) tool provide means for effectively describing and      modeling HIS by hospital functions, application systems and physical data      processing components. The 3LGM(2) tool has been used to model parts of the      information system of the health care system of the German federal state Saxony      and of the Leipzig University Medical Centre. RESULTS: Experiences showed, that      3LGM(2) is suitable for supporting information management even in rHIS. We      explain some benefits for information management in regional as well as local      settings. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the 3LGM(2) depends strictly on its      integration in management structures on the institutional, regional, and even      national or European level.

PMID- 16959537   - Incident reporting is a central strategy for improving safety in the NHS (UK      National Health Service). In this paper we discuss incident reporting in      anaesthesia. We discuss four schemes for reporting: longstanding, departmental      based schemes; newer, hospital wide schemes; a national scheme; and an      inter-departmental scheme (developed by the authors). We also discuss an example       report. We argue that this example report gives an expert 'story' of an incident,      describing the incident in a way that is useful for the practical activities of      maintaining and improving safety. We argue that stories are told and retold in      reporting schemes. The reporting schemes are not just there to collect data but      to afford the stories of what went wrong. In turn these schemes must be afforded       stories by the anaesthetists, safety managers and the organisation at large. We      consider how schemes can be designed to afford a 'good' story, one that is useful      for the maintaining and improvement of safety.

PMID- 16950650   - OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of user-centered design techniques for developing      the requirements for an antibiotic decision support system (DSS) in an intensive       care unit (ICU). DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: The setting was a 21-bed mixed      medical/surgical adult ICU. This was an observational study with unstructured      interviews and participatory design process. Models were constructed to      demonstrate cultural, workflow, sequence/trigger events and other artefacts used       to support antibiotic prescribing in the ICU. Using participatory design, a paper     prototype was developed and case studies were used to simulate antibiotic      prescribing for bacterial isolates. This information was used to design and pilot      the decision support tool. RESULTS: The key users were identified as residents,      registrars and the unit pharmacist. They identified the major requirements:      ability to collate and print microbiology results, and to provide education and      antibiotic advice for isolates. The final product was a real time microbiology      browser and decision support tool for antibiotic prescribing (ADVISE). Uptake of       the system was rapid with over 6000 encounters in the first 6 months. An audit of      antibiotic use performed on all consecutive patients 6 months before and after     introducing the DSS demonstrated a reduction in total and broad-spectrum      antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Contextual design methodology in conjunction with      participatory design was an effective method to design this antibiotic decision      support tool. The process facilitated physician and pharmacist ownership of the      system that resulted in immediate uptake and ongoing use.

PMID- 16949860   - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in positioning systems and telecommunications      have provided the technology needed for the development of location aware medical      applications. We developed a system, named EmerLoc, which is based upon this      technology and uses a set of sensors that are attached to the patient's body, a      micro-computing unit which is responsible for processing the sensor readings and       a central monitoring unit, which coordinates the data flow. OBJECTIVE: To      demonstrate that the proposed system is technically feasible and acceptable for     the potential users. METHOD: Transmission speed is assessed mostly by means of      transmission of DICOM compliant images in various operational scenarios. The      positioning functionality was established both outdoor using GPS and indoor using      the UCLA Nibble system. User acceptability was assessed in a hospital setting by       15 physicians who filled in a questionnaire after having used the system in an      experimental setting. RESULTS: Transmission speeds ranged from 88kB/s for a IEEE       802.11 infrastructure to 2.5kB/s for a GSM/GPRS scenario. Positioning accuracy      based on GPS was 5-10m. The physicians rated the technical aspects on average      above 3 on a 5-point scale. Only the data presentation was assessed to be not      satisfactory (2.81 on a 5-point scale). CONCLUSION: The reported results prove      the feasibility of the proposed architecture and its alignment with widely      established practices and standards, while the reaction of potential users who      evaluated the system is quite positive.

PMID- 16949338   - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to establish knowledge about how online      access to epidemiological data from general practitioners (GPs) electronic health      record (EHR) system should be provided. Before such systems are developed and      deployed a decision about the appropriate system architecture must be made. Such       a decision should ideally be based on knowledge about the properties of different      system architectures. This choice is important because the system architecture      may affect the willingness of GPs to participate in providing epidemiological      data from their EHR system. METHOD: Verifying the performance and properties of      an architectural approach by implementing and deploying a system on a      trans-institutional level and performing evaluations studies is a very resource      demanding method to establish a foundation for the decision of appropriate system      architecture. Instead, we have tried to create this foundation by constructing a       prototype system, establish knowledge about the properties of the system using      experiments, and finally compare the properties of the federated approach to the       properties of the centralised approach. By using this methodological approach we       provide the best available knowledge, on this stage, for the appropriate system      architecture to use for providing access to epidemiological data from the local      population. RESULTS: Our experimental results show that it is possible to improve      the timeliness and the temporal and spatial resolution of epidemiological data,      compared to traditional centralised disease surveillance systems. Up-to-date      epidemiological data from the local population may be provided directly from the       source EHR system within 4s. The responsiveness of the system is minimally      affected (0.1s) as the number of participating data providers grows from 1 to 49       data providers. The comparison of the federated approach to the centralised      approach indicates that federated approaches avoid the privacy issues involved,      as intended; it offers better scalability when computing speed is compared, and      it provides better specificity because more data about the patient may be used.      CONCLUSION: The conclusion from our study is that the federated approach to      providing epidemiological data about the local population has many benefits over       the traditional centralised approach. A federated approach to an epidemiology      system may raise the GPs awareness of local disease outbreak because it is      possible to share information about incidence rates of communicable diseases and       use of laboratory requests in a geographical area that predates laboratory-based       disease surveillance. The effects of the federated approach could be improved      data quality in the EHR systems and improved representativeness of the      epidemiological data for the areas covered by such systems.

PMID- 16938487   - PURPOSE: Computer-based training (CBT) systems offer the potential to efficiently      support modern teaching and learning. However, it is still unknown if a similar     efficient learning experience built on sound learning theories and corresponding       design principles can be created in the complex health care environment. The      purpose of this paper is to analyse to what extent learning theories and      corresponding design principles are relevant and can successfully be applied in      computer-based training in medicine. METHODS: We use the case-based CBT system      CAMPUS as an example for a CBT system currently used to enhance the medical      teaching and learning experience. We apply two well-accepted learning theories      (Bloom's taxonomy and practice fields) and related design principles to determine      to what extent they are relevant and fulfilled in the context of CAMPUS. RESULTS:      We demonstrate that in principle these learning theories and design principles      can be implemented using computer-based training. However, not all design      principles can be fulfilled by the system alone; rather the integration of the      system into adequate -- traditional or virtual -- teaching and learning      environments is essential. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional learning theories and design       principles are a valuable means in designing adequate CBT systems in medicine.      They can be successfully implemented in CBT systems for medical education if the       system itself is adequately integrated into teaching and learning environments.

PMID- 16935555   - To deliver patient-specific advice at the time and place of a consultation is an       important contribution to improving clinician performance. Using computer-based      decision support on the basis of clinical pathways is a promising strategy to      achieve this goal. Thereby integration of IT applications into the clinical      workflow is a core precondition for success. User acceptance and usability play a      critical role: additional effort has to be balanced with enough benefit for the      users and interaction design and evaluation should be handled as an intertwined,       continuous process. Experiences from routine use of an online surgical pathway at      Marburg University Medical Center show that it is possible to successfully      address this issue by seamlessly integrating patient-specific pathway      recommendations with documentation tasks which have to be done anyway, by      substantially reusing entered data to accelerate routine tasks (e.g. by      automatically generating orders and reports), and by continuously and      systematically monitoring pathway conformance and documentation quality.

PMID- 16935025   - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship of completion rates for a standardized set      of computerized clinical reminders across a large healthcare system to practice      and provider characteristics. METHODS: The relationship between completion rate      for 13 standardized reminders at 49 primary care practices in the VA New England       Healthcare System for a 30-day period and practice characteristics, provider     demographics and, via survey, provider attitudes was analyzed. RESULTS: There was      no difference in clinical reminder completion rate between staff physicians      versus nurse practitioners/physician assistants (87.6% versus 88.1%) but both      were better than residents (76.6%, p<0.0001). With residents excluded, there were      no differences between hospital and community-based clinics or between teaching      and non-teaching sites. Clinical reminder completion rate was lower for sites      that did not fully utilize support staff in completion process versus sites that       did (82.4% versus 88.1%, p<0.0001). Analysis of survey results showed no      correlation of completion rate with provider demographics or attitudes towards      reminders. However there was significant correlation with frequency of receiving       individual feedback on reminder completion (r=0.288, p=0.004). CONCLUSION:      Completion of computerized clinical reminders was not affected by a variety of      provider characteristics, including professional training, demographics and      provider attitude, although was lower among residents than staff providers.      However incorporation of support staff into clinic processes and individualized      feedback to providers were strongly associated with improved completion. These      findings demonstrate the importance of considering practice and provider factors       and not just technical elements when implementing informatics tools.

PMID- 16931133   - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in reaching consumers directly      through the Internet and different telecommunication systems. The most important       contacts in health care will always be the face-to-face meetings, but the tools      of health informatics can be seen as a means to an end, which is to provide the      best possible health care. A variety of applications have been described in      different references. To our knowledge there has been no review of a      research-based state of the art in the field of consumers' experiences in using      different applications in health informatics. According to the benefits in using       information communication technology (ICT) as being cost-effective and timesaving      it is of great importance to focus on and examine consumers' experiences. It is      important that it is user friendly and regarded as valuable and useful. AIM: The       aim of this study was to describe consumers' subjective experiences of using      electronic resources with reference to health and illness. DESIGN AND/OR METHOD:       A systematic literature search was performed in databases CINAHL, Medline and      Cochrane, as well as a manual search. Retrieved references (n=14) were appraised       according to their scientific structure and quality. A broad search was performed      in order to find as many different applications as possible. Our primary      intention was to identify existing references describing consumers' experiences      with ICT. RESULTS: In spite of this broad search few references were found.      Twelve references remained and three themes were identified: support and help,      education and information, and telecommunication instead of on-site visiting.      Consumers felt more confident and empowered, their knowledge increased and their       health status improved due to the ICT resources. Lack of face-to-face meetings or     privacy did not appear to be a problem. CONCLUSION: ICT can improve the      nurse-patient relationship and augment well-being for consumers. More research is      needed to measure consumers' experiences and factors that influence it.

PMID- 16931132   - INTRODUCTION: Instant messaging (IM) is suited for immediate communication      because messages are delivered almost in real time. Results from studies of IM      use in enterprise work settings make us believe that IM based services may prove       useful also within the healthcare sector. However, today's public instant      messaging services do not have the level of information security required for     adoption of IM in healthcare. We proposed MedIMob, our own architecture for a      secure enterprise IM service for use in healthcare. MedIMob supports IM clients      on mobile devices in addition to desktop based clients. METHODS: Security threats      were identified in a risk analysis of the MedIMob architecture. The risk analysis      process consists of context identification, threat identification, analysis of      consequences and likelihood, risk evaluation, and proposals for risk treatment.      RESULTS: The risk analysis revealed a number of potential threats to the      information security of a service like this. Many of the identified threats are      general when dealing with mobile devices and sensitive data; others are threats      which are more specific to our service and architecture. Individual threats      identified in the risks analysis are discussed and possible counter measures      presented. DISCUSSION: The risk analysis showed that most of the proposed risk      treatment measures must be implemented to obtain an acceptable risk level; among       others blocking much of the additional functionality of the smartphone. To      conclude on the usefulness of this IM service, it will be evaluated in a trial      study of the human-computer interaction. Further work also includes an improved      design of the proposed MedIMob architecture.

PMID- 16931131   - PURPOSE: To investigate the case of a municipal wound care practice and the      process of designing a specific computer documentation record system. In carrying      out our kind of action research, creation of the system that integrate digital      photos, was supposed to remake the old wound care documentation system and      transform it into a more advanced and unified tool. METHODS: Ethnographic studies      were conducted before and parallel to the design work. Nurse practitioners were      involved in design and actively determining essentials of the computer artefact.       Developmental Work Research (DWR) is the framework against which data from the      work practice and system development where analyzed and interpreted. RESULTS:      First, an old-fashioned information system (IS) within health care work will not       successfully be replaced by a new one, unless the new is better "as a whole",      that is, better supports work practices of a range of occupational and      professional workers. Second, when designing information system for the public      sector, system designers will almost always face dilemmas based on a      contradiction between central, high level interest and a local level      work-practice perspective. DISCUSSION: Our study reveals that the work practice      of the municipal nurses is characterized by three distinctive features: High      mobility, the need for face-to-face interaction in different locations, and a      great variety of artefact usage. This implies that a new information system has      to be "better as a whole" dealing with those characteristics.

PMID- 16931130   - OBJECTIVE: The work proposed a novel bit-rate-reduced approach for reducing the      memory required to store a remote diagnosis and rapidly transmission it. METHOD:       In the work, an 8x8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) approach is adopted to      perform subband decomposition. Modified set partitioning in hierarchical trees      (SPIHT) is then employed to organize data and entropy coding. The translation      function can store the detailed characteristics of an image. A simple      transformation to obtain DCT spectrum data in a single frequency domain      decomposes the original signal into various frequency domains that can further     compressed by wavelet-based algorithm. In this scheme, insignificant DCT      coefficients that correspond to a particular spatial location in the      high-frequency subbands can be employed to reduce redundancy by applying a      proposed combined function in association with the modified SPIHT. RESULTS AND      CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results showed that the embedded DCT-CSPIHT image      compression reduced the computational complexity to only a quarter of the      wavelet-based subband decomposition, and improved the quality of the      reconstructed medical image as given by both the peak signal-to-noise ratio      (PSNR) and the perceptual results over JPEG2000 and the original SPIHT at the      same bit rate. Additionally, since 8x8 fast DCT hardware implementation being      commercially available, the proposed DCT-CSPIHT can perform well in high speed      image coding and transmission.

PMID- 16931129   - INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to develop a reference functional model for electric      health record systems (RFM). Such a RFM is built from functions using functional       descriptive elements (FDEs) and represents the static relationships between them.      This paper presents a new format for describing electric health record (EHR)      system functions. METHODS: Questionnaire and field interview survey was conducted      in five hospitals in Japan and one in the USA, to collect data on EHR system      functions. Based on survey results, a reference functional list (RFL) was      created, in which each EHR system function was listed and divided into 13 FDE      types. By analyzing the RFL, we built the meta-functional model and the      functional model using UML class diagrams. The former defines language for     expressing the functional model, while the latter represents functions, FDEs and       their static relationships. RESULTS: A total of 385 functions were represented in      the RFL. Six patterns were found for the relationships between functions. The      meta-functional model was created as a new format for describing functions.      Examples of the functional model, which included the six patterns in the      relationships between functions and 11 verbs, were created. DISCUSSIONS: We      present the meta-functional model, which is a new description format for the      functional structure and relationships. Although a more detailed description is      required to apply the RFM to the semiautomatic generation of functional      specification documents, our RFM can visualize functional structures and      functional relationships, classify functions using multiple axes and identify the      similarities and differences between functions. The RFM will promote not only the      standardization of EHR systems, but also communications between system developers      and healthcare providers in the EHR system-design processes.

PMID- 16920013   - Improvement of chronic disease management in primary care entails monitoring      indicators of quality over time and across patients and practices. Informatics      tools are needed, yet implementing them remains challenging. OBJECTIVE: To      identify critical success factors enabling the translation of clinical and      operational knowledge about effective and efficient chronic care management into       primary care practice. DESIGN: A prospective case study of positive deviants      using key informant interviews, process observation, and document review.      SETTING: A chronic disease management (CDM) collaborative of primary care      physicians with documented improvement in adherence to clinical practice      guidelines using a web-based patient registry system with CDM guideline-based      flow sheet. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty community-based physician participants using      predominantly paper records, plus a project management team including the      physician lead, project manager, evaluator and support team. ANALYSIS: A critical      success factor (CSF) analysis of necessary and sufficient pathways to the      translation of knowledge into clinical practice. RESULTS: A web-based CDM      'toolkit' was found to be a direct CSF that allowed this group of physicians to      improve their practice by tracking patient care processes using evidence-based      clinical practice guideline-based flow sheets. Moreover, the information and      communication technology 'factor' was sufficient for success only as part of a      set of seven direct CSF components including: health delivery system      enhancements, organizational partnerships, funding mechanisms, project      management, practice models, and formal knowledge translation practices. Indirect      factors that orchestrated success through the direct factor components were also       identified. A central insight of this analysis is that a comprehensive quality      improvement model was the CSF that drew this set of factors into a functional      framework for successful knowledge translation. CONCLUSIONS: In complex primary      care settings environment where physicians have low adoption rates of electronic       tools to support the care of patients with chronic conditions, successful      implementation may require a set of interrelated system and technology factors.

PMID- 16904367   - OBJECTIVES: Most healthcare providers provide mobile service for their medical      staff; however, few healthcare providers provide mobile service as part of their       outpatient service. The mobile outpatient service system (MOSS) focuses on      illness treatment, illness prevention and patient relation management for     outpatient service users. Initiated in a local hospital in Taiwan, the MOSS pilot      project was developed to improve outpatient service quality and pursue higher     patient safety. METHOD: This study focuses on the development of the MOSS. The      workflow, architecture and target users of the MOSS are delineated. In addition,       there were two surveys conducted as part of this study. After a focus group of      medical staff identified areas in which outpatient services might be improved by       the MOSS, the first survey was administered to outpatients to confirm the focus      group's intuitions. The second administration of the survey explored outpatient      satisfaction after they used the MOSS service. RESULTS: With regard to outpatient      attitudes, about 93% of participants agreed that the mobile outpatient service      improved outpatient service quality. In the area of outpatient satisfaction,      about 89% of participants indicated they were satisfied with the mobile      outpatient service. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Supported by our study finding, we      propose that more diverse mobile outpatient services can be provided in the      future.

PMID- 16901750   - Can higher quality healthcare practices emerge from the development and use of a       loosely integrated set of intranets? This paper examines that question through a       series of empirical examples that draw on data from one healthcare organization      that was part of a multi-year, multi-industry study of intranets. Some of this      organization's intranets link clinical practice guidelines to healthcare      delivery, in ways that mimic manufacturing sector efforts to improve product      quality and reliability. Others act as staging grounds and information      repositories for coordinating responses to new rulings and changing      interpretations of how to implement recently enacted healthcare legislation. This      activity is reminiscent of coordinated responses, among firms and their legal      counsel, to new legislation in other industries, like telecommunications; and to       wide-reaching regulatory efforts, like environmental protection. Although the      technologies have changed and the legislative objectives vary greatly,      organizational approaches to such improvements are less varied. Ironically, these      overarching similarities focus attention on the need for continued articulation      of changes and local differences in information system use, and the ability of      boundary-spanners to introduce ways of working that bridge these gaps and refine       healthcare practices that drift toward higher quality.

PMID- 16901749   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a revised technology acceptance model to examine      what determines mobile healthcare systems (MHS) acceptance by healthcare      professionals. METHOD: Conformation factor analysis was performed to test the      reliability and validity of the measurement model. The structural equation      modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model. RESULTS: The results      indicated that compatibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use      significantly affected healthcare professional behavioral intent. MHS      self-efficacy had strong indirect impact on healthcare professional behavioral      intent through the mediators of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.      Yet, the hypotheses for technical support and training effects on the perceived      usefulness and perceived ease of use were not supported. CONCLUSION: This paper     provides initial insights into factors that are likely to be significant      antecedents of planning and implementing mobile healthcare to enhance      professionals' MHS acceptance. The proposed model variables explained 70% of the       variance in behavioral intention to use MHS; further study is needed to explore      extra significant antecedents of new IT/IS acceptance for mobile healthcare. Such      as privacy and security issue, system and information quality, limitations of      mobile devices; the above may be other interesting factors for implementing      mobile healthcare and could be conducted by qualitative research.

PMID- 16899403   - Electronic patient records often include text that has been copied and pasted      from other records. A type of copying that involves the highest risk for     confusion, medical error, and medico-legal harm is the copying of the clinical      examination. We studied this phenomenon using an automated text categorization      algorithm to detect copied exams in a set of 167,076 VA records. Exam copying      occurred frequently, in about 3% of all exams, or in 25% of patient charts.      Thirteen percent of all authors had copied at least one exam, and 3% of authors      had copied an exam from another author. There were significant differences      between service types and levels of training of the authors. We speculate that      copying and pasting of exams degrades the quality of the medical record, and that      studying this behavior is integral to our understanding of phenomenology of the      electronic medical record.

PMID- 16893677   - BACKGROUND: Information retrieval systems have the potential to improve patient      care but little is known about the variables which influence clinicians' uptake      and use of systems in routine work. AIM: To determine which factors influenced      use of an online evidence retrieval system. DESIGN OF STUDY: Computer logs and      pre- and post-system survey analysis of a 4-week clinical trial of the Quick      Clinical online evidence system involving 227 general practitioners across      Australia. RESULTS: Online evidence use was not linked to general practice      training or clinical experience but female clinicians conducted more searches      than their male counterparts (mean use=14.38 searches, S.D.=11.68 versus mean      use=8.50 searches, S.D.=9.99; t=2.67, d.f.=157, P=0.008). Practice      characteristics such as hours worked, type and geographic location of clinic were      not associated with search activity. Information seeking was also not related to       participants' perceived information needs, computer skills, training nor Internet      connection speed. Clinicians who reported direct improvements in patient care as       a result of system use had significantly higher rates of system use than other     users (mean use=12.55 searches, S.D.=13.18 versus mean use=8.15 searches,      S.D.=9.18; t=2.322, d.f.=154 P=0.022). Comparison of participants' views pre- and      post- the trial, showed that post-trial clinicians expressed more positive views       about searching for information during a consultation (chi(2)=27.40, d.f.=4, P<      or =0.001) and a significantly greater number reported seeking information      between consultations as a result of having access to an online evidence system      in their consulting rooms (chi(2)=9.818, d.f.=2, P=0.010). CONCLUSION:      Clinicians' use of an online evidence system was directly related to their     reported experiences of improvements in patient care. Post-trial clinicians      positively changed their views about having time to search for information and      pursued more questions during clinic hours.

PMID- 16884944   - This article discusses findings from qualitative research conducted with nurses      in a hospital Emergency Department. It explores nurses' attitudes towards a      patient care information system (PCIS) installed by hospital management in an      effort to improve patient care through more effective "data sharing". Nurses'      definitions of care are examined vis-a-vis their perceptions of administrative      tasks and technologies like the PCIS. Efforts are made to link the system with      wider patterns of administrative technology acquisition in health care and users'      everyday/night experiences of using these technologies. The article also presents      key themes from a literature review of recent case studies about information      technology implementation in nursing. Results show that nurses choose to define      care in a way that highlights relationship building and physical/emotional      connectedness between nurse and patient. The article contends that nurses'      refusal to incorporate technology-enabled "data sharing" into their definitions      of care is indicative of efforts to make visible their caring work, often      rendered invisible by the feminization of care. The article concludes by      reaffirming the importance of 'remembering the basics', i.e., patient care is      rooted in the skilled practice of individual caregivers, not in data sharing.

PMID- 16875873   - BACKGROUND: Being a nurse in the ICU requires extensive clinical knowledge as      well as great skill in making stressful decisions and acting decisively while      maintaining close working relationships with team members and other hospital      staff. Nurses in the ICU draw on social, cognitive, and technological resources      to accomplish tasks and achieve goals. Culture is a process that creates and      makes available these resources through the situated activities of ICU actors.      AIM: To understand the means by which cultural process enhances patient safety by      establishing and maintaining barriers to adverse events. METHODS: During the      final month of a year-long ethnographic study of patient safety in an ICU, we      interviewed nine staff nurses of the unit, and asked them to talk about the      details of their work routines. From this talk, and drawing upon our field notes,      we identified shared "orienting frames" which are used by nurses to organize,      prioritize, conduct, and evaluate their work. RESULTS: We report on three      orienting frames commonly articulated by interviewees. "Being organized" creates       the means for streamlining work in a way that makes it efficient and robust to      expected challenges. "Being prepared for emergencies" creates means for     effectively coping with the inevitable crises. Finally, "Being responsible and      accountable" creates means for nurses to demand resources and to act decisively      when they otherwise might not be granted the authority to do so. CONCLUSIONS: To       understand safety in health care, we must go beyond investigating adverse events       that arise due to insufficient safety barriers, and study how cultural process      creates and maintains these barriers. Understanding cultural process would help      improve design and implementation of safety-enhancing interventions and      technologies in the ICU.

PMID- 16872892   - Home telehealth is an effective alternative for some aspects of traditional care       in chronic illnesses such as diabetes, congestive heart failure and asthma.      However, in spite of evidence to support use of home telehealth technologies,      they have not been adopted as predicted. A significant challenge for     decision-makers is applying results from multiple small studies to the care of      large numbers of clients in a health region. Aside from the technology, this      complex decision must also include expected client outcomes, variations in      nursing resources and their deployment in service delivery. This paper presents      research evidence supporting the effectiveness of home telehealth for diabetes      care, with attention to the range of technologies and outcome measures reported.       It also discusses implications of a recently released national study on "Homecare      Indicators" that reported resource allocation and outcomes in home care. The      burden of illness, evidence of technology effectiveness and proposed home care      outcome indicators are considered together in a decision framework to demonstrate      an approach for decision-makers and practitioners to transfer home telehealth      research into practice. The resulting decision framework is applied to diabetes      care within one large health region in Canada to illustrate its utility as a      research transfer strategy.

PMID- 16870501   - OBJECTIVES: This study describes a computer simulation model that has been      developed to explore organizational changes required to improve patient safety      based on a medication error reporting system. METHODS: Model parameters for the      simulation model were estimated from data submitted to the MEDMARX medication      error reporting system from 570 healthcare facilities in the U.S. The model's      results were validated with data from the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare      Initiative consisting of 44 hospitals in Pennsylvania that have adopted the      MEDMARX medication error reporting system. The model was used to examine the      effects of organizational changes in response to the error reporting system. Four     interventions were simulated involving the implementation of computerized      physician order entry, decision support systems and a clinical pharmacist on      hospital rounds. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the analysis indicate that improved      patient safety requires more than clinical initiatives and voluntary reporting of      errors. Organizational change is essential for significant improvements in      patient safety. In order to be successful, these initiatives must be designed and      implemented through organizational support structures and institutionalized      through enhanced education, training, and implementation of information      technology that improves work flow capabilities.

PMID- 16870500   - INTRODUCTION: In this article we begin by connecting the concept of simplicity of      user interfaces of information systems with that of usability, and the concept of      complexity of the problem-solving in information systems with the concept of      usefulness. We continue by stating "the usability axiom" of medical information      technology: information systems must be, at the same time, usable and useful. We       then try to show why, given existing technology, the axiom is a paradox and we      continue with analysing and reformulating it several times, from more fundamental      information processing perspectives. DISCUSSION: We underline the importance of      the concept of representation and demonstrate the need for context-dependent      representations. By means of thought experiments and examples, we advocate the      need for context-dependent information processing and argue for the relevance of       algorithmic information theory and case-based reasoning in this context. Further,      we introduce the notion of concept spaces and offer a pragmatic perspective on      context-dependent representations. We conclude that the efficient management of      concept spaces may help with the solution to the medical information technology      paradox. Finally, we propose a view of informatics centred on the concepts of      context-dependent information processing and management of concept spaces that      aligns well with existing knowledge centric definitions of informatics in general      and medical informatics in particular. In effect, our view extends M. Musen's      proposal and proposes a definition of Medical Informatics as context-dependent      medical information processing. SUMMARY: The axiom that medical information      systems must be, at the same time, useful and usable, is a paradox and its      investigation by means of examples and thought experiments leads to the      recognition of the crucial importance of context-dependent information      processing. On the premise that context-dependent information processing equates       to knowledge processing, this view defines Medical Informatics as a      context-dependent medical information processing which aligns well with existing       knowledge centric definitions of our field.

PMID- 16854617   - OBJECTIVES: To assess the usability of an emerging POE system, OM/Lab, for the      computer-supported ordering of laboratory tests. We were more specifically      interested in the relation of the usability problems detected in the user testing      sessions with the order behaviour in terms of efficiency and errors in ordering.       METHODS: A cognitive walkthrough of the OM/Lab system was conducted by two      analysts using four real-life scenarios for ordering laboratory tests, which were      reviewed for comprehensiveness by an expert clinician. Thereafter, the OM/Lab      system was evaluated on its usability in testing sessions with seven potential      end-users of the system performing these same four scenarios. The results of      these end-user testing sessions were used to analyze the effect of usability      flaws on the quality of ordering in terms of omissions, errors in orders and      cancelled orders. RESULTS: The analyses revealed a total of 33 usability      problems, of which 25 problems were revealed both by the cognitive walkthrough      and in the end-user sessions. These 25 usability problems indeed led to      inefficient order behaviour, omissions and errors in orders and even to cancelled      orders. DISCUSSION: Our results revealed that the OM/Lab system suffered from a      high number of usability flaws. The interface design flaws were, among other     things, related to misallocation of buttons on the screen, incomprehensibility of      button labels and feedback containing no relevant information to the user about      the cause of errors made and consequences of a user's action. Additionally, our     user test session results indicated that the OM/Lab system also suffered from      user interaction problems of a more socio-technical nature. These sessions      revealed, among other things, that the more specific action sequences to be      executed within the ordering model of the OM/Lab system did not correspond to the      daily working routines of end-users and that the grouping of laboratory tests      within clusters did not match the paper-based order forms. The seemingly negative      effects of these usability flaws on the quality of ordering and the inefficiency       of work processes during the pilot implementation finally lead to withdrawal of      the OM/Lab system from clinical practice. Though the system implementation      failed, our usability study brought research on (re)designing and evaluating      clinical computer applications at a higher status in our institution. It is now      recognized that usability evaluation studies that will support good quality of      clinical practice are highly important.

PMID- 16846748   - This paper discusses aspects of information technologies for health care, in      particular on transinstitutional health information systems (HIS) and on      health-enabling technologies, with some consequences for the aim of medical      informatics. It is argued that with the extended range of health information      systems and the perspective of having adequate transinstitutional HIS      architectures, a substantial contribution can be made to better patient-centered       care, with possibilities ranging from regional, national to even global care. It       is also argued that in applying health-enabling technologies, using ubiquitous,      pervasive computing environments and ambient intelligence approaches, we can      expect that in addition care will become more specific and tailored for the      individual, and that we can achieve better personalized care. In developing      health care systems towards transinstitutional HIS and health-enabling      technologies, the aim of medical informatics, to contribute to the progress of      the sciences and to high-quality, efficient, and affordable health care that does      justice to the individual and to society, may be extended to also contributing to      self-determined and self-sufficient (autonomous) life. Reference is made and      examples are given from the Yearbook of Medical Informatics of the International       Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and from the work of Professor Jochen      Moehr.

PMID- 16844404   - Shared care concepts such as managed care and continuity of care are based on      extended communication and cooperation between different health professionals or       between them and the patient respectively. Health information systems and their     components, which are very different in their structure, behavior, data and their     semantics as well as regarding implementation details used in different      environments for different purposes, have to provide intelligent      interoperability. Therefore, flexibility, portability, and future orientation      must be guaranteed using the newest development of model driven architecture. The      ongoing work for the German health telematics platform based on an architectural       framework and a security infrastructure is described in some detail. This concept      of future proof health information networks with virtual electronic health      records as core application starts with multifunctional electronic health cards.       It fits into developments currently performed by many other developed countries.

PMID- 16843718   - OBJECTIVES: Co-located teams often use material objects to communicate messages      in collaboration. Modern desktop computing systems with abstract graphical user     interface (GUIs) fail to support this material dimension of inter-personal      communication. The aim of this study is to investigate how tangible user     interfaces can be used in computer systems to better support collaborative      routines among co-located clinical teams. METHODS: The semiotics of physical      objects used in team collaboration was analyzed from data collected during 1      month of observations at an emergency room. The resulting set of communication      patterns was used as a framework when designing an experimental system. Following      the principles of augmented reality, physical objects were mapped into a physical      user interface with the goal of maintaining the symbolic value of those objects.       RESULTS: NOSTOS is an experimental ubiquitous computing environment that takes      advantage of interaction devices integrated into the traditional clinical      environment, including digital pens, walk-up displays, and a digital desk. The      design uses familiar workplace tools to function as user interfaces to the      computer in order to exploit established cognitive and collaborative routines.      CONCLUSION: Paper-based tangible user interfaces and digital desks are promising       technologies for co-located clinical teams. A key issue that needs to be solved      before employing such solutions in practice is associated with limited feedback      from the passive paper interfaces.

PMID- 16843717   - Implementing an information technology system can impact more than just quality      of care and patient outcomes. The purpose of this 4-year, observational research       project is to examine changes in organizational culture, quality improvement (QI)      maturity, and quality of care following adoption of a single, electronic health      record (EHR) system within an integrated healthcare network. The primary outcome       measure, the Culture and Quality Questionnaire (CQQ), assesses the perceived      culture of an organization and the degree of CQI maturity in seven quality      management areas. Baseline surveys were distributed prior to conversion to the      EHR. Subsequent data collection occurred at 12 months post "go live" and will      occur at 24 and 36 months after the first hospital "go live". Secondary data were      abstracted from routinely collected patient satisfaction measures and standard      quality indicators. Contrary to expectation, our findings from the Baseline and      12-month follow-up data suggest that employees perceived the organizational      culture as becoming more, rather than less, hierarchical. We also hypothesized      that quality indicators would show improvement due to enhanced information flow      and ease of information retrieval. This hypothesis was not supported by 1-year     results. However, follow-up data from years two and three may provide different      results.

PMID- 16839808   - PURPOSE: We present a method for the automated acquisition of a multilingual      medical lexicon (for Spanish, French and Swedish) to be used within the framework      of a medical cross-language text retrieval system. METHODS: For the lexical      acquisition process, we incorporate seed lexicons and lists of trusted term      translations derived from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The seed lexicons for Spanish,       French and Swedish are automatically generated from (previously manually      constructed) Portuguese, German and English sources by simple string      transformations. Lexical and semantic hypotheses are then validated by processing      pairs of term translations. In a last step, we use the cleaned list of "approved"      translations in order to augment, step by step, the target dictionaries by      processing the parallel corpora in terms of co-occurrence patterns of      hypothesized translation equivalents which cannot be derived by simple character       substitutions. RESULTS: An existing multilingual lexicon for the medical domain      with about 60,000 entries for English, German, and Portuguese was automatically      augmented by more then 17,000 new lexemes for Spanish, French, and Swedish.      CONCLUSIONS: Our approach constitutes a promising method for the automated      creation of new lexicon entries and their linkage to semantic identifiers.

PMID- 16829180   - PURPOSE: Patients have the most to gain from reducing medical errors; yet, little      research has been done to investigate the role they could or already do play in      detecting and preventing errors in their own health care. The purpose of this      study is to examine patient's role in detecting, preventing, and recovering from       medical errors in outpatient oncology. METHODS: In this paper, we use cognitive      work analysis and Rasmussen's taxonomy of human performance to describe five      cases of medical errors that occurred in an outpatient, cancer-care setting. We      detail the role of the patient in each case, and analyze each role using      constructs from previous studies of human behavior and errors. RESULTS:      Observational data indicates that patients engage in a range of tasks that      identify, prevent, and recover from medical errors in outpatient cancer care. The      results of this study point to the importance of considering patients and their     work in both the design of patient-care information systems and the structure of       clinical-care environments that enable safe and effective health care.

PMID- 16829179   - Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are prospective empirical studies used to      investigate the effect of a particular medical intervention. The design of a      clinical trial is a delicate decision process, as each of the decisions that are       taken in this process influences the eventual result of the clinical trial.      Despite the efforts that are put into trial design, many trials fail to show an      effect of the intervention. In some of these situations the intervention may be      truly ineffective, however, more often this is caused by problems with the      inclusion of patients and a resulting lack of statistical power to show the      effect. To avoid this problem, in the design of a trial, the statistical power     that can be achieved with the current design choices is calculated and balanced      with economic considerations. In the choice of the entry criteria however, an      important step in the design process, the influence of the chosen criteria on      statistical power and number of eligible patients is not quantified. As these      criteria influence the characteristics of the study population and the number of       patients that will be eligible for the trial, and thereby the chances of finding       an effect of the intervention, we believe that also in the choice of entry      criteria explicit estimates of the number of eligible patients should be made.      This paper presents a method to arrive at precise, objective estimates of      statistical power and the number of eligible patients, using a registry database.      Furthermore, we describe how this method is incorporated in the process of      choosing entry criteria for a clinical trial. We illustrate the method with an      example in the area of severe sepsis.

PMID- 16828336   - The objective of this study was to analyse physician-nurse cooperation in the      medication ordering and administration process from a cognitive point of view. In      this paper, we compared two work organizations characterized by: (1) a      synchronous cooperation engendered by common doctor-nurse medical rounds and (2)       an asynchronous situation characterized by split physician's and nurse's rounds.       Both organizations worked with paper-based documentation systems. We relied on a       cooperation cognitive architecture model and used specific methods from cognitive      ergonomics to analyse physicians' and nurses' activity, communications and      cooperation. The analysis of doctor-nurse dialogues during the medical rounds      demonstrated that in the synchronous situation, the nurses actively participated       in the medication ordering process. Such dialogues supported the elaboration of      shared knowledge in the form of a common frame of reference (COFOR) which both      actors rely on to control the entire medication process, and more precisely the      coordination of their actions. Document analysis showed that the orders were far       from exhaustively documented. However, self-confrontation interviews with the      nurses demonstrated that, except for a small number of ill-documented orders,      they were able to accurately retrieve the physician's complete intended orders.      In this work organization, the nurse was able to control the medication      administration process at a high level, because she understood the highest level       of strategic control of the medication ordering carried out by the physician. In       the asynchronous situation, the results were reversed. The nurses no longer     participated in the decision making phase of the medication process. Doctor-nurse      communications were rare, and their shared knowledge about the patient was      weakened. Although written orders proved to be better documented, the nurses      suffered from a lack of knowledge on the patient's medical case and the      particular context of the medical decision making when confronted with incomplete      or ambiguous orders. In this work organization, the nurse would find herself      restrained to low level process control and confined in a reactive, instead of      anticipative, management mode. This latter work organization is very similar to      the CPOE situation we observed in previous studies, where the coordination of      physicians' and nurses' actions was delegated to the system. We suggest that it      is essential to take these organizational and cognitive aspects into account when      (re-)designing CPOE applications.

PMID- 16828335   - There is evidence to suggest that health professionals are reluctant to accept      and utilise information and communication technologies (ICT) and concern is      growing within health informatics research that this is contributing to the lag      in adoption and utilisation of ICT across the health sector. Technology      acceptance research within the field of information systems has been limited in      its application to health and there is a concurrent need to develop and gain      empirical support for models of technology acceptance within health and to      examine acceptance and utilisation issues amongst health professionals to improve      the success of information system implementation in this arena. This paper     outlines a project that examines ICT acceptance and utilisation by Australian      occupational therapists. It describes the theoretical basis behind the      development of a research model and the methodology being employed to empirically      validate the model using substantial quantitative, qualitative and longitudinal      data. Preliminary results from Phase II of the study are presented. The      theoretical significance of this work is that it uses a thoroughly constructed      research model, with potentially the largest sample size ever tested, to extend      technology acceptance research into the health sector.

PMID- 16824794   - As healthcare looks for new and innovative ways to deliver more services with      less resources we are increasingly turning to informatics based solutions.      However, the means by which information systems (IS) are both designed and      implemented will impact how successful the system will be at enhancing care      delivery. We believe a key component to successful IS design is the      methodological rigor by which design requirements are gleaned and applied. This      paper describes our use of a grounded theory (GT) guided methodology for     designing an ontology of palliative care severe pain management. In this paper we      illustrate how the methodological rigor of GT was applied to three palliative      information sources to allow us to gain an understanding of how severe pain is      managed. We then illustrate how that understanding was formalized into an      ontology and applied to IS design of a computer based tool to enhance education      around palliative care severe pain management.

PMID- 16824793   - In studies on success and failure of ICT applications in health care, the      'context' is often used to explain the failure of a system and seldom to explain       the success of a system. Science and Technology Studies (STS) have showed that      for understanding success and failure of phenomena, one has to take a symmetrical      approach and thus use the same concept for analyzing success and failure. In this      article we analyze the success of OZIS, a communication protocol that makes it      possible for pharmacists to exchange medication data by sharing a regionally      accessible electronic medication record. Though OZIS serves a common goal -      reducing medication errors - the stakeholders that are involved also have other,       competing, interests. By focussing on the context and more specifically the      interests of the stakeholders, we will show how the success of OZIS can be      explained. By doing this, we will also show that this context is highly dynamic      and that continuously changing incentives and constraints within the context lead      to both facilitating and threatening the success of OZIS.

PMID- 16824792   - OBJECTIVE: Today, there are many barriers that prevent seamless electronic voice       and data communication with remote content and services that the user wants to      access at a certain time and place. This is especially the case in hospitals,      where the communication needs are very complex and context dependent, and where      strict privacy and safety conditions apply. Personal network (PN) technology is      expected to enable the various private networks of a single person to communicate      seamlessly with each other, hiding underlying network complexity from the user.      We have analyzed the usefulness of PNs in hospitals. METHODS: We studied the use       case of a medical emergency surgery, and built a demonstrator by integrating      models of the specialists' personal area networks, home networks, office      networks, and a hospital network into a single virtual network. We performed user     studies in various hospitals, using a combination of individual context      interviews, scenario and requirements verification, guided experimenting with the      demonstrator and concluding workshops. RESULTS: We show that, in case of medical       emergencies, PNs can provide a means to enlist remote assistance from peers      wherever they are in the world at a particular moment. It can also ease the      communication between the operating theatre and the outside world, e.g. for     educational purposes.

PMID- 16822715   - In any collaborative work settings, people naturally develop physical tools and      associated work processes that support the management of the interdependencies in      information, materials, and social needs. Field studies of management of      operating rooms pointed out that collaborative work is supported by an      infrastructure that is composed of mostly non-computerized, physical components.       The supporting infrastructure is jointly maintained and exploited, with      constantly evolving patterns of usage, in response to complexity of coordination       needs and the uncertain environment. To represent status and plans, users seem to      invent structures based both on idiosyncratic preferences and on negotiated      symbols. The fluidity and ease of restructuring workplaces to support      collaborative work may be explained in part by the high resolution and bandwidth       of workplaces: a large number of ways in which workers could structure their work      and a high capacity to convey rich information and meanings quickly to      collaborators. We argue that to support health care workers, designers of      computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems should learn how the physical       and perceptual properties of workplaces are exploited, and that CSCW systems      should be designed to allow maximum freedom of restructuring and reconfiguring as      part of workplaces to enhance bandwidth and resolution of representation and      communication.

PMID- 16815741   - PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a Web-based, patient-orientated diabetic      education management (POEM) system. METHODS: The POEM system has been developed      to extend hospital patient education by integrating patients' medical care data      into their education program components and presenting them on the Web. Since      most patients are concerned about their medical care data, the POEM system can      provide the incentives for patients to continuously and persistently log in and      learn the required knowledge and skills, improving their clinical outcomes. A      quasi-experimental method that uses control groups and pretests was used to      evaluate the outcomes of the system intervention. We recruited patients with      type-2 diabetes and alternatively assigned them to intervention and control      groups. We compared laboratory test results including fasting blood glucose,      HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and HDL between the two groups from       the first visit through each follow-up visit. The study period progressed from      September 2003 to May 2004 at the Metabolism Center of a medical teaching      hospital in Taipei. RESULTS: In this study, we recruited 274 participants: 134      (57% males and 43% females) in the intervention group and 140 (46% males and 54%       females) in the control group. The patients' laboratory test results from the      first visit for fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol level, TG, and      HDL in the intervention and control groups were respectively 187.54+/-77.10 and      189.99+/-73.49 mg/dl, 9.03 +/- 2.79% and 8.95 +/- 2.23%, 193.29 +/- 47.93 and      202.52 +/- 58.45 mg/dl, 152.48 +/- 70.85 and 157.37 +/- 74.88 mg/dl, and 44.97      +/- 12.09 and 45.32 +/- 12.08 mg/dl. There were three follow-up visits during the      study period. We collected laboratory test results of the two groups through each      of the following visits and analyzed them using ANCOVA. We discovered a      significant difference in fasting blood glucose levels between intervention and      control group as early as the first follow-up. At the second follow-up, both      fasting blood glucose and HBA1c levels were significantly different between      intervention and control group. At the third follow-up, there was a significant      difference in fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, and total cholesterol between      intervention and control group. We also monitored the number of logins for the      patients in the intervention group during the follow-up period. The result showed      the patients had consistently logged into the POEM system (about 8.5 +/- 3.7      logins per person per month after 3 months enrollment). Thus, the patients in the      intervention group had better control of their fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and      total cholesterol levels than those in the control group due to the assistance of      the system. CONCLUSIONS: The POEM system can help patients control their glucose,      HbA1c and total cholesterol levels to manage their diabetes, providing an easy      and inexpensive way to extend hospital-based patient education services for     community-based continuous patient education.

PMID- 16815740   - Health information system (HIS) architecture and socio-technical approaches for     system deployment have been topics of systematic research for decades.      Sustainable operation in gradually changing environments, however, has not yet      received sufficient attention. Even HIS that have gone life to the satisfaction      of their developers and end-users may degrade gracefully or fail catastrophically      if not continuously and thoroughly kept in sync with their environment. Critical       environmental changes may owe their origins to the complexity of health care and       its delivery. Seemingly minor environmental changes can result in significant      failures on the part of the information system and may adversely affect the      quality of health care delivered. Such minor degradation or near failure may go      unnoticed for a while and then hit unexpectedly. Five origins of decay will be      analyzed. Methods of systematic observation and containment of such decaying      processes will tentatively be presented. Some origins of system decay exist in      the immediate hospital or regional setting of usage. Indicators to identify      processes of decay will be suggested and methods to preemptively reduce the risk       of decay will be presented. Other origins span national health care systems or     beyond. Not all such risks can hence be controlled locally. Software Oversight      Committees may be an instrument to monitor those risks that cannot be controlled       through routine local management.

PMID- 16815739   - PROBLEM: key word assignment has been largely used in MEDLINE to provide an      indicative "gist" of the content of articles and to help retrieving biomedical      articles. Abstracts are also used for this purpose. However with usually more      than 300 words, MEDLINE abstracts can still be regarded as long documents;      therefore we design a system to select a unique key sentence. This key sentence      must be indicative of the article's content and we assume that abstract's      conclusions are good candidates. We design and assess the performance of an      automatic key sentence selector, which classifies sentences into four     argumentative moves: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS and CONCLUSION: METHODS: we rely      on Bayesian classifiers trained on automatically acquired data. Features      representation, selection and weighting are reported and classification      effectiveness is evaluated on the four classes using confusion matrices. We also       explore the use of simple heuristics to take the position of sentences into      account. Recall, precision and F-scores are computed for the CONCLUSION class.      For the CONCLUSION class, the F-score reaches 84%. Automatic argumentative      classification using Bayesian learners is feasible on MEDLINE abstracts and      should help user navigation in such repositories.

PMID- 16815738   - This paper presents Determining Information flow Breakdown (DIB), a method for     analyzing adverse events in clinical environments from the perspective of      breakdowns in information flow. The larger context for DIB is that it is the      first stage in a process that promotes organizational learning in response to      adverse events through the design of novel IT solutions. DIB is based on the      theoretical view of distributed cognition and adopts a system-wide view of      failures. DIB is both a reactive and a proactive method in that it aims to locate      the causes of either actual or potential adverse events by investigating all      elements of the system related to a chosen aspect of patient care. It was      developed and evolved using a case study approach whereby data on actual and      potential adverse events in clinical environments was collected, modeled and      analyzed using successive versions of the method. We provide an explanation and      overview of the DIB method, and discuss our experiences of applying it in      practice via a detailed example.

PMID- 16814603   - This paper addresses the issue of how semantic information can be automatically      assigned to compound terms, i.e. both a definition and a set of semantic      relations. This is particularly crucial when elaborating multilingual databases      and when developing cross-language information retrieval systems. The paper shows      how morphosemantics can contribute in the constitution of multilingual lexical      networks in biomedical corpora. It presents a system capable of labelling terms      with morphologically related words, i.e. providing them with a definition, and      grouping them according to synonymy, hyponymy and proximity relations. The      approach requires the interaction of three techniques: (1) a language-specific      morphosemantic parser, (2) a multilingual table defining basic relations between       word roots and (3) a set of language-independent rules to draw up the list of      related terms. This approach has been fully implemented for French, on an about      29,000 terms biomedical lexicon, resulting to more than 3000 lexical families. A       validation of the results against a manually annotated file by experts of the      domain is presented, followed by a discussion of our method.

PMID- 16807085   - Hyperlinked web trust marks have been a popular topic of discussion during the      past 10 years. However, the discussion has focused mostly on what these trust      marks are not doing in terms of helping patients (or other lay end users) find      reliable medical information on the web. In this paper, we discuss how this focus      on patients and their actions with respect to trust marks, has overshadowed, if      not rendered invisible, what trust marks are doing to educate medical      site/information providers. We draw on data from ethnographic research conducted       at the Health on the Net Foundation in 2002 and 2003 in order to explore an      alternate definition of what it means to be a 'user' of a trust mark and the      importance of the review process in educating site providers. We argue that      understanding the work involved in the process of assigning a seal is crucial to       understanding the role that the seal plays as part of the medical internet.

PMID- 16807084   - Socio-technical systems (STS) analysis has provided us with a powerful framework       with which to analyse the reasons behind the poor acceptability, uptake and      performance of many information or communication technology systems (ICT).      However, for the contribution of STS thinking to be more than simply a means of      critiquing current practices and ICT systems, it needs to also contribute to the       process of developing new and more effective ICT systems. Specifically, we need      to develop a formal design language for translating our insights about the      socio-technical nature of work, into design specifications that result in better       interventions in the work place. We need to get 'technical' about what we mean      and about what we want from a design, and we need to work alongside technologists      to shape technology, as well as the processes, organisations and cultures within       which they will be embedded. Indeed the process of design itself can be seen as a      socio-technical one, and understanding the decision to design itself may allow us      one day to stop designing for people, and create STS that sustainably design      themselves.

PMID- 16807083   - It has been predicted that major introduction of information communication      technology (ICT) for health care organisations (HCO) over the next 10 years will       be used to achieve the universal coverage and improve the quality of health care       delivered to people. Which is the best strategy on ICT transfer, adoption and      adaptation for the local Mozambican HCO? This paper argues that a sociotechnical       approach of ICT development can help policy makers and health managers to address      the technology transfer in a better and more appropriate way to their social      context and to the public health reforms in progress. The urgency of health care       demands (e.g. AIDS epidemic) and the institutional changes implemented by the      Government and the local Ministry of Health (MOH), open a dynamic process of      re-organisation inside the health institutions in the next years. This process      needs to be monitored and initiatives planned, which places pressure on the      evolution of health information system (HIS). The increase in the use of ICT can       be an ally for health managers. The emergence of the open source software (OSS)      and the recent ICT market trends towards networking may also enable local HCO to       better face and solve the long process of health care standardisation, which      usually prepares and accompanies any introduction of ICT. On the other side, the       "big bang" introduction of electronic packages, devices and software applications      may be an obstacle framing and anchoring local HCO to external settings, "modern"      and universal models. Thus, a uniform step-by-step implementation of      hospital-based health information system is desirable.

PMID- 16798071   - BACKGROUND: Online evidence retrieval systems are a potential tool in supporting       evidence-based practice. Effective and tested techniques for assessing the impact      of these systems on care delivery and patient outcomes are limited. PURPOSE AND      METHODS: In this study we applied the critical incident (CI) and journey mapping       (JM) techniques to assess the integration of an online evidence system into      everyday clinical practice and its impact on decision making and patient care. To      elicit incidents semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 clinicians (13      hospital physician specialists, 16 clinical nurse consultants (CNCs)) who were      experienced users of the online evidence system. Clinicians were also asked      questions about how they had first used the system and how their use and      experiences had changed over time. These narrative accounts were then mapped and       scored using the journey mapping technique. RESULTS: Clinicians generated 85      critical incidents. Three categories of impact were identified: impact on      clinical practice, impact on individual clinicians and impact on colleagues      through the dissemination of information gained from the online evidence system.       One quarter of these included specific examples of system use leading to      improvements in patient care. Clinicians obtained an average journey mapping      score of 22 out of a possible score of 36, demonstrating a good level of system      integration. Average scores of doctors and CNCs were similar. However individuals      with the same scores often had very different journeys in system integration.      CONCLUSIONS: The CI technique provided clear examples of the way in which system       use had influenced practice and care delivery. The JM technique was found to be a      useful method for providing a quantification of the different ways and extent to       which, clinicians had integrated system use into practice, and insights into how       system use can influence organisational culture. The development of the journey      mapping stages provides a structure by which the program logic of a clinical      information system and its desired outcomes can be made explicit and be based      upon users' experiences in everyday practice. Further work is required using this      technique to assess its value as an evaluation method.

PMID- 16798070   - OBJECTIVE: To explore concrete approaches to socio-technical design of      collaborative healthcare information systems and to design a groupware technology      for collaborative clinical trial protocol writing. METHOD: We conducted "quick      and dirty ethnography" through semi-structured interviews, observational studies,      and work artifacts analysis to understand the group work for protocol      development. We used participatory design through evolutionary prototyping to      explore the feature space of a collaborative writing system. Our design      strategies include role-based user advocacy, formative evaluation, and change      management. RESULTS: Quick and dirty ethnography helped us efficiently understand      relevant work practice, and participatory design helped us engage users into      design and bring out their tacit work knowledge. Our approach that intertwined      both techniques helped achieve a "work-informed and user-oriented" design. This      research leads to a collaborative writing system that supports in situ      communication, group awareness, and effective work progress tracking. The      usability evaluation results have been satisfactory. The system design is being      transferred to an organizational tool for daily use.

PMID- 16798069   - The University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) are the result of the merge of six      hospitals into one single organization. While a true fusion of the management has      been effectively done, it was not the case 5 years after for several databases,      and in particular the ADT (admission, discharge, transfer). In order to truly      realize the fusion, a new ADT service has been built using state of the art      technology and standards in order to replace the existing seven services. This      paper presents the results of the redesign and development of the new ADT      service. The data model, based on HL7 RIM, is described and the technologies      selected are presented. Finally, a status after 1 year of production is      presented.

PMID- 16798068   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the perceived effect of computerized physician order entry      (CPOE) on professional collaboration, workflow and quality of care. DESIGN:      Semi-structured interviews with experts involved in the design, implementation      and evaluation of computerized physician order systems in the United States.      MEASUREMENTS: The interview transcripts were analyzed using six key concepts that      identify context, professional collaboration, workflow and quality of care.      RESULTS: The interviews reveal the complexity of CPOE. Although providers enter     the orders, others collaborate in the decision-making process. There is a      profound impact on workflow beyond that of the provider. While quality of care is      the main impetus for implementation, it remains terribly difficult to measure the      impact on quality. CONCLUSIONS: A proper understanding of CPOE as a collaborative      effort and the transformation of the health care activities into integrated care       programs requires an understanding of how orders are created and processed, how      CPOE as part of an integrated system can support the workflow, and how risks      affecting patient care can be identified and reduced, especially during hand-offs      in the workflow.

PMID- 16798067   - Integrated information systems for managing patient data transform the nature of       hospital work to the extent that the work practices, the responsibilities, even      the professional identities are likely to undergo major changes. Therefore,      during the organizational implementation of the IS, attention should be paid to      the future users and how they understand and see what is going on. Here the focus      is on these interpretation processes, analyzed as technological frames. That is,       people develop different assumptions, expectations and knowledge concerning new      technology. During this sense-making process they build their idea of that      technology, its technological frame. We analyzed the pre-implementation frames      that could be discerned in 24 interviews of hospital personnel. Main influences      on the frames in this case were the work role in the organization, knowledge      about the new system, and attitudes toward the old systems. The social context      appeared to have a significant influence in the users' interpretation processes      and the frames seemed to be congruent within one group. So far, the incongruence       between groups appeared to have caused no major problems for the implementation.

PMID- 16797227   - Pathologies and acts are classified in thesauri to help physicians to code their       activity. In practice, the use of thesauri is not sufficient to reduce      variability in coding and thesauri are not suitable for computer processing. We      think the automation of the coding task requires a conceptual modeling of medical      items: an ontology. Our task is to help lung specialists code acts and diagnoses       with software that represents medical knowledge of this concerned specialty by an      ontology. The objective of the reported work was to build an ontology of      pulmonary diseases dedicated to the coding process. To carry out this objective,       we develop a precise methodological process for the knowledge engineer in order     to build various types of medical ontologies. This process is based on the need      to express precisely in natural language the meaning of each concept using      differential semantics principles. A differential ontology is a hierarchy of      concepts and relationships organized according to their similarities and      differences. Our main research hypothesis is to apply natural language processing      tools to corpora to develop the resources needed to build the ontology. We      consider two corpora, one composed of patient discharge summaries and the other     being a teaching book. We propose to combine two approaches to enrich the      ontology building: (i) a method which consists of building terminological      resources through distributional analysis and (ii) a method based on the      observation of corpus sequences in order to reveal semantic relationships. Our     ontology currently includes 1550 concepts and the software implementing the      coding process is still under development. Results show that the proposed      approach is operational and indicates that the combination of these methods and      the comparison of the resulting terminological structures give interesting clues       to a knowledge engineer for the building of an ontology.

PMID- 16793330   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the kinds of unintended consequences related to the      implementation of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) in the outpatient      setting. DESIGN: Ethnographic and interview data were collected by an      interdisciplinary team over a 7 month period at four clinics. MEASUREMENTS:      Instances of unintended consequences were categorized using an expanded Diffusion      of Innovations theory framework. RESULTS: The framework was clarified and      expanded. There are both desirable and undesirable unintended consequences, and      they can be either direct or indirect, but there are also many consequences that       are not clearly either desirable or undesirable or may even be both, depending on      one's perspective. The undesirable consequences include error and security      concerns and issues related to alerts, workflow, ergonomics, interpersonal      relations, and reimplementations. CONCLUSION: Consequences of implementing and      reimplementing clinical systems are complex. The expanded Diffusion of      Innovations theory framework is a useful tool for analyzing such consequences.

PMID- 16793329   - OBJECTIVE: To describe the current status of and future plans for health      informatics and related standards in China and analyze the problems raised in the      process of standardization for health informatics. METHODS: Data were collected      through investigation and interviews, complemented by a comprehensive review of      relevant literatures and regulations/law documents about health informatics and      related standards in China. RESULTS: Health informatics has been greatly      developed in China. Significant resources were committed to construct and improve      the health information system. Approximately 35-40% of hospitals have constructed      hospital information system. Over 80% of medical organizations above the      county/district level, 27% of town level hospitals and all CDC above the      county/district level can transmit real-time epidemic situation reporting through      public health information system. However, lack of standards became a bottleneck       to utilize and improve health informatics. China has adopted some vocabulary,      classification, coding standards and message standards. Moreover, several      national standardization actions for health informatics have been taken. In the      process of standardization, the main barriers consist of financial, technical,      cultural and language problems, legal and ethical concerns and others.      CONCLUSIONS: Informatics has the potential to play an important role in China's      healthcare reform process and standards are the basis for the information sharing      and interoperability. Governments and partners of health informatics have      realized the importance of standards and taken the initiatives in trying to solve      the problem of lacking standards, but much work still needs to be done.

PMID- 16787759   - OBJECTIVES: Grid-based technologies are emerging as potential solutions for     managing and collaborating distributed resources in the biomedical domain. Few      examples exist, however, of successful implementations of Grid-enabled medical      systems and even fewer have been deployed for evaluation in practice. The      objective of this paper is to evaluate the use in clinical practice of a      Grid-based imaging prototype and to establish directions for engineering future      medical Grid developments and their subsequent deployment. METHOD: The MammoGrid       project has deployed a prototype system for clinicians using the Grid as its      information infrastructure. To assist in the specification of the system      requirements (and for the first time in healthgrid applications), use-case      modelling has been carried out in close collaboration with clinicians and      radiologists who had no prior experience of this modelling technique. A critical       qualitative and, where possible, quantitative analysis of the MammoGrid prototype      is presented leading to a set of recommendations from the delivery of the first      deployed Grid-based medical imaging application. RESULTS: We report critically on      the application of software engineering techniques in the specification and      implementation of the MammoGrid project and show that use-case modelling is a      suitable vehicle for representing medical requirements and for communicating      effectively with the clinical community. This paper also discusses the practical       advantages and limitations of applying the Grid to real-life clinical      applications and presents the consequent lessons learned. CONCLUSIONS: The work      presented in this paper demonstrates that given suitable commitment from      collaborating radiologists it is practical to deploy in practice medical imaging       analysis applications using the Grid but that standardization in and stability of      the Grid software is a necessary pre-requisite for successful healthgrids. The      MammoGrid prototype has therefore paved the way for further advanced Grid-based      deployments in the medical and biomedical domains.

PMID- 16784886   - With the growing complexities of health care delivery in western industrialized      countries, the need for inter-organizational communication is increasingly      emphasized. In this paper, we focus on a system - ZorgDomein - that was developed      to optimize GP-medical specialist communication. Contrary to the notion of      'shared' or 'integrated care' that often assumes a 'seamless' health care, we      will focus on the negotiated order of GP-specialist cooperation, showing the      precarious localized arrangements that allow both a bridging and a separation of       professional activities concerning patient care. Furthermore, we analyze how      ZorgDomein changes the arrangements to maintain a working order. The main focus      of the article is on the way GP-specialist referrals are on the one hand      conceptualized as discrete events of information sharing, while on the other hand      are part of a process of care. We will argue that in standardization attempts by       national and local actors, embodied within the technology, information exchange      between first and secondary care is made into a product. This conceptualization      and materialization neglects the process in which this information comes about or     is being created. We discuss the consequences of this for the design and use of      the technology.

PMID- 16784885   - OBJECTIVE: Local authorities face real challenges when it comes to annual budget       planning for funding the system of long-term care. Uncertainty about the      long-term cost of caring for current residents in the system, in addition to      unknown future admissions, have made the tasks of local authority budget managers      very complex and demanding. In this paper, we present a software implementation      of a novel forecasting framework developed by the authors to provide useful      information to local authority budget planners involved in long-term care.      METHODS: The tool is built upon a forecasting framework, which combines unit      costs of care with an estimated underlying survival model for publicly funded      residents in long-term care, to provide forecasts of the cost of maintaining the       group of elderly people who are currently in long-term care (referred to as known      commitments) for a period of time. A prototype version of the software tool,      which was created and tested in collaboration with an English borough, allows      user interaction via a friendly graphical interface that guides through a set of       screens of options in a familiar wizard fashion. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Feedback      from care planners and managers show that the tool helps them gain better     understanding of the patterns of length-of-stay of residents under their care,      and provides quantitative inputs into their decision making on budget planning      for long-term care. The development of the software tool brings advanced      modelling techniques out of research papers into the hands of decision makers in       the public sector and contributes to improving the delivery of long-term care.

PMID- 16782398   - We draw on an ongoing study of an electronic booking project at the University      Hospital North Norway where general practitioners are given the opportunity to      book appointments at the hospital for their patients. Electronic booking offers      well-defined and standardised services as well as standardised procedures for     preparing the patient for the appointment at the hospital. We examine how the      standards inscribed in the booking system shape medical work and how they bring      to the surface a social dilemma between collective and individual interests in      how the key actors reflect on the consequences of the system. We combine two      social theories, namely Actor Network Theory and the theory of collective action.      As a conclusion, we argue that simple and well-defined cases of patients'      problems and willingness among the general practitioners to undertake work      traditionally conducted at the hospital are conditions for making electronic      booking successful. However, when the patients' problems are unclear the booking       system needs to be combined with traditional referrals. We also point to how the       general practitioners' attitude towards the system is time-dependent. Their     initial positive attitude towards the potential public goods produced by booking       transforms into putting more weight on the individual interests.

PMID- 16782397   - OBJECTIVE: This paper considers the utility of actor-network theory as a basis      for uncovering the mutual interdependencies between system design and system      impact in an evolving project, and for exploring the implications that these      interdependencies hold for the production of safety in behavioral health care.      METHODS: Drawing on a field study of a systems project in a human-services firm,       the paper applies key concepts from actor-network theory in the analysis of a      design crisis that emerged during the course of the project. RESULTS:      Actor-network theory provides a compelling framework in this situation for     identifying the diverse interests involved, revealing their complex interactions,      and illuminating the importance of the emerging system as an organizational actor     in its own right. CONCLUSION: Actor-network theory shows promise for use in other     analyses concerned with the role of information technology in the construction of      safety in health care settings.

PMID- 16781189   - BACKGROUND: Functional annotation of genes is an important task in biology since       it facilitates the characterization of genes relationships and the understanding       of biochemical pathways. The various gene functions can be described by      standardized and structured vocabularies, called bio-ontologies. The assignment      of bio-ontology terms to genes is carried out by means of applying certain      methods to datasets extracted from biomedical articles. These methods originate      from data mining and machine learning and include maximum entropy or support      vector machines (SVM). PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to propose an      alternative to the existing methods for functionally annotating genes. The      methodology involves building of classification models, validation and graphical       representations of the results and reduction of the dimensions of the dataset.      METHODS: Classification models are constructed by Linear discriminant analysis      (LDA). The validation of the models is based on statistical analysis and      interpretation of the results involving techniques like hold-out samples, test      datasets and metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision and      F-measure. Graphical representations, such as boxplots, Andrew's curves and      scatterplots of the variables resulting from the classification models are also      used for validating and interpreting the results. RESULTS: The proposed      methodology was applied to a dataset extracted from biomedical articles for 12      Gene Ontology terms. The validation of the LDA models and the comparison with the      SVM show that LDA (mean F-measure 75.4%) outperforms the SVM (mean F-measure      68.7%) for the specific data. CONCLUSION: The application of certain statistical       methods can be beneficial for functional gene annotation from biomedical      articles. Apart from the good performance the results can be interpreted and give      insight of the bio-text data structure.

PMID- 16781188   - Examples from on-going work are analyzed to point out cross-cultural factors that      need consideration as they are likely to influence the design of consumer health       information systems (CHIS). Tailored and flexible presentation of information,      appropriate communication services and access to health information can      contribute to CHIS use in diverse local and international contexts. It is argued       that being mindful of socio-cultural environments, age groups, and health      conditions will enhance design and use of CHIS. This will augment current      approaches by developing more suitable and culturally sensitive CHIS.

PMID- 16777476   - OBJECTIVES: Hospital information systems (HIS) are a substantial quality and cost      factor for hospitals. Systematic monitoring of HIS quality is an important task;       however, this task is often seen to be insufficiently supported. To support      systematic HIS monitoring, we developed HIS-Monitor, comprising about 107      questions, focusing on how a hospital information system does efficiently support      clinical and administrative tasks. METHODS: The structure of HIS-Monitor consists      of a matrix, crossing HIS quality criteria on one axis with a list of process      steps within patient care on the other axis. HIS-Monitor was developed based on      several pretests and was now tested in a larger feasibility study with 102      participants. RESULTS: HIS-Monitor intends to describe strengths and weaknesses      of information processing in a hospital. Results of the feasibility study show      that HIS-Monitor was able to highlight certain HIS problems such as      insufficiently supported cross-departmental communication, legibility of drug      orders and other paper-based documents, and overall time needed for     documentation. We discuss feasibility of HIS-Monitor and the reliability and      validity of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Further refinement and more formal      validation of HIS-Monitor are planned.

PMID- 16769245   - The effective use of information technology (IT) is a crucial component for the      delivery of effective services in health care. Current approaches to medical      informatics (MI) research have significantly contributed to the success of IT use      in health care but important challenges remain to be addressed. We believe that      expanding the multi-disciplinary basis for MI research is important to meeting      these research challenges. In this paper, we outline theories and methods used in      information systems (IS) research that we believe can inform our understanding of      health care IT applications and outcomes. To do so, we discuss some general      differences in the focus and methods of MI and IS research to identify broad      opportunities. We then review conceptual and methodological approaches in IS that      have been applied in health care IT research. These include: technology-use      mediation, collaborative work, genre theory, interpretive research, action      research, and modeling. Examples of these theories and methods in healthcare IS      research are illustrated.

PMID- 16769244   - PURPOSE: Evaluation of a computerized problem-oriented medical record (CPOMR) for     health care work. METHODS: A qualitative study of the daily use of a CPOMR at an       internal medicine hospital ward over a period of 3 months, during which 66      patients were treated based on clinical information recorded in the CPOMR though       back up by a paper-based record was available. The study is based on participant       observation and interviews with the clinicians who had the most profound and      extensive experience in the use of the CPOMR. Before and during the test-period      the author attended project planning meetings, a training workshop in the use of       the CPOMR for nurses and physicians and local coordination meetings. After the      test, one focus-group discussion with physicians and nurses (6 participants;      duration 11/2h) was conducted as well as 13 open-ended interviews (5 nurses, 2      social and health assistants, 4 physicians, 2 IT-people; duration: 16-42 min;      average of 29 min). The interviewees formed the core group using the CPOMR.      RESULTS: Use of the CPOMR led to more time spent documenting clinical work,      fragmentation of patient situation into separate problems, and lack of an      overview. CONCLUSION: The problem-oriented method for structuring a computerized       medical record may provide a description of how physicians think or ought to      think, but does not adequately support complex clinical work. While the CPOMR can      be used for patients with few, simple problems who are admitted for only a short       time, it is not useful for patients with a complex set of problems or for     patients admitted for longer periods of time. This is in accordance with      criticism of the paper-based POMR, the problematic points of which do not seem to      be alleviated through computerization. The problem-oriented way of ordering      information should be accompanied by a source- and time-oriented approach.

PMID- 16769243   - A seamless support of information flow for increasingly distributed healthcare      processes requires to integrate heterogeneous IT systems into a comprehensive      distributed information system. Different standards contribute to ease this      integration. In a research project focussing on the development of a reference      architecture for inter-institutional health information systems, we identified      concurring standards currently in use. We therefore categorized these integration      standards by distinguishing between technical and semantic integration on the one      hand, and data and functional integration on the other hand. In addition,      standards for semantic integration are roughly categorized according to their     scope. By placing standards into a corresponding matrix a "semantic gap" is      revealed, which cannot be covered by standards as it contains volatile medical      concepts. As a conclusion, it is recommended to conceptually consider the      necessity of system evolution in system architectures and also in future      integration standards.

PMID- 16769242   - BACKGROUND: This paper concentrates on strategies for less costly handling of      medical images. Aspects of digitization using conventional digital cameras, lossy      compression with good diagnostic quality, and visualization through less costly      monitors are discussed. METHOD: For digitization of film-based media, subjective       evaluation of the suitability of digital cameras as an alternative to the      digitizer was undertaken. To save on storage, bandwidth and transmission time,      the acceptable degree of compression with diagnostically no loss of important      data was studied through randomized double-blind tests of the subjective image      quality when compression noise was kept lower than the inherent noise. A      diagnostic experiment was undertaken to evaluate normal low cost computer     monitors as viable viewing displays for clinicians. RESULTS: The results show      that conventional digital camera images of X-ray images were diagnostically      similar to the expensive digitizer. Lossy compression, when used moderately with       the imaging noise to compression noise ratio (ICR) greater than four, can bring      about image improvement with better diagnostic quality than the original image.      Statistical analysis shows that there is no diagnostic difference between      expensive high quality monitors and conventional computer monitors. CONCLUSION:      The results presented show good potential in implementing the proposed strategies      to promote widespread cost-effective telemedicine and digital medical      environments.

PMID- 16766223   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to provide a further step toward the      decentralization of identification and demographic information about persons by      solving issues related to the integration of demographic agents in a federated      healthcare environment. The aim is to identify a particular person in every      system of a federation and to obtain a unified view of his/her demographic      information stored in different locations. METHOD: This work is based on semantic      models and techniques, and pursues the reconciliation of several current      standardization works including ITU-T's Open Distributed Processing, CEN's prEN      12967, OpenEHR's dual and reference models, CEN's General Purpose Information      Components and CORBAmed's PID service. RESULTS: We propose a new paradigm for the      management of person identification and demographic data, based on the      development of an open architecture of specialized distributed components      together with the incorporation of techniques for the efficient management of      domain ontologies, in order to have a federated demographic service. This new      service enhances previous correlation solutions sharing ideas with different      standards and domains like semantic techniques and database systems. The      federation philosophy enforces us to devise solutions to the semantic, functional      and instance incompatibilities in our approach. CONCLUSION: Although this work is      based on several models and standards, we have improved them by combining their     contributions and developing a federated architecture that does not require the      centralization of demographic information. The solution is thus a good approach      to face integration problems and the applied methodology can be easily extended      to other tasks involved in the healthcare organization.

PMID- 16765634   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a telemedicine program in which      electrocardiogram (EKG), body weight and/or blood pressure are measured at home      and medically trained personnel judge the transmitted data and council the      patients by telephone. METHOD: We systematically studied the outcome and      cost-effectiveness of the cardiac programs carried out by Shahal (SHL) during the      past 19 years. RESULT: Most patients (85%) with acute complaints resembling      coronary artery disease, could be reassured, representing a savings of about      677.000 euro per 10,000 members/yr in Israel in 1989, and a marked reduction in      patient delay to 44 min (median). In chronic heart failure a 66% reduction in      hospitalisation days was observed, together with an improvement in quality of      life. A large Healthcare Insurance Company in Germany (Taunus BKK) has calculated      that it can save at least 5 million euro per year with the use of such services.       CONCLUSION: Disease management with concomitant telemedicine for coronary artery       disease and chronic heart failure is safe and effective and has a huge potential       for cost savings, improvements in quality of life and in prognosis of heart      disease.

PMID- 16762589   - PURPOSE: We propose a simple methodology for heterogeneous data collection and      central repository-style database design in healthcare. Our method can be used      with or without other software development frameworks, and we argue that its      application can save a relevant amount of implementation effort. Also, we believe      that the method can be used in other fields of research, especially those that      have a strong interdisciplinary nature. BACKGROUND: The idea emerged during a      healthcare research project, which consisted among others in grouping information      from heterogeneous and distributed information sources. We developed this      methodology by the lessons learned when we had to build a data repository,      containing information about elderly patients flows in the UK's long-term care      system (LTC). DESIGN: We explain thoroughly those aspects that influenced the      methodology building. The methodology is defined by six steps, which can be      aligned with various iterative development frameworks. We describe here the      alignment of our methodology with the RUP (rational unified process) framework.      The methodology emphasizes current trends, as early identification of critical      requirements, data modelling, close and timely interaction with users and      stakeholders, ontology building, quality management, and exception handling.      RESULTS: Of a special interest is the ontological engineering aspect, which had      the effects with the highest impact after the project. That is, it helped      stakeholders to perform better collaborative negotiations that brought better     solutions for the overall system investigated. An insight into the problems faced      by others helps to lead the negotiators to win-win situations. We consider that      this should be the social result of any project that collects data for better     decision making that leads finally to enhanced global outcomes.

PMID- 16759900   - OBJECTIVE: In this article we will describe a new approach to improve the quality      of care of chronic HIV/AIDS patients, combining the integral care approach with a      telemedicine system. METHODS: Following the integral care approach, we included      the patient in a multidisciplinary care team, covering the whole process of care       with a telemedicine system that allows the patient to improve his/her self-care      and to be remotely followed-up by the healthcare professionals. RESULTS: This      challenge has been met by the creation of the "VIHrtual Hospital" project. Its      main goal is the definition, development, clinical routine installation and      evaluation of a telemedicine service that complements standard care with a      telecare follow-up for treating stable HIV infected patients, in a chronic stage       of their disease, and study if that improves the quality of assistance and the      expense per patient compared to the conventional control (without telemedicine      service) that patients usually have. Although the study is not yet finished, in      the discussion the main benefits and drawbacks of this telemedicine system are      described. CONCLUSIONS: The main conclusion of the article is that a new home      telecare model for chronic HIV/AIDS patients has been created and has been      implemented through the "VIHrtual Hospital" in the Clinic Hospital in Barcelona      (Spain). The architecture of this web-based system fulfills the demanding      security and integration requirements of the IT department of the hospital. An      easy-to-use graphical interface for both patients and professionals has also been      developed. The low costs of the system allow us to cover a wide range of patients      and promising results are being obtained regarding the use of telemedicine      systems for improving the follow-up care of chronic HIV/AIDS patients and for     creating a new care model for this disease.

PMID- 16750417   - OBJECTIVES: To automatically evaluate the quality of health information on the      Internet, we presents a method for detecting indicators for quality of health      information. METHODS: An automatic indicator detection tool (AIDT) was developed       in the following steps: (1) 18 initial technical criteria were chosen; (2)      multiple measurable indicators were defined for each criterion; (3) these      measurable indicators on the Web pages were automatically detected by a computer       program; (4) the detectable indicators were selected for each criterion based on       detection accuracy and occurrence frequency, and detecting criteria on Web pages;      (5) AIDT was developed based on the detectable indicators and criteria. The      efficiency of detection tool was measured by recall and precision of detecting      criteria. The performance of AIDT was tested using three data sets. RESULTS: AIDT      with validated detectable indicators can reach 93% recall and 98% precision on      these data sets. AIDT can automatically and correctly detect measurable criteria       on Web pages. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic detecting indictors for quality of health      information is feasible and effective. Using an automatic detecting tool is a      promising method for identifying quality criteria of health information, and      eventually it can be used to develop instruments for evaluating the quality of      health Websites.

PMID- 16702022   - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the key implications of the      implementation of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system on pathology      laboratory services. METHODS: An in-depth qualitative study using observation,      focus groups and interviews with pathology staff, managers, clinicians and      information systems staff during implementation of a CPOE system in 2004 at a      major Australian teaching hospital. RESULTS: Pathology laboratories experienced a      shift in their work roles resulting in altered work practices, responsibilities      and procedures. These changes were marked by terminological and procedural      changes in the test order process from when clinicians issued a request for a      test, to the new system that established clinical orders at the point of care.      This change was accompanied by some organizational dysfunctions including the      emergence of a new category of "frustrated" orders without specimens; problems      with the procedure of adding tests to previously existing specimens; the      appearance of discrepancies in the recorded time of specimen collection. In      response to these changes, hospital and pathology staff adopted a variety of      means to cope with their changed circumstances. These ranged from efforts to      increase clinical awareness to compensatory laboratory workarounds and enforced      rule changes. CONCLUSIONS: CPOE systems can have a major impact on the nature of       the work of pathology laboratories. Understanding how and why these changes occur     can be enhanced through considering the organizational and social contexts      involved. The effectiveness of CPOE systems will rely on how administrators and      staff approach and deal with these challenges.

PMID- 16675297   - OBJECTIVES: Several important problems in the majority of countries are      challenging the centralized and overburdened current model of healthcare.      Telehealthcare is presented as a new paradigm that offers high expectations to      solve this picture. In this paper we present the major outcomes of the viability       study of a novel personalized telehealthcare system for nephrology (NEFROTEL).      METHODS: The study evaluates the accuracy and quality of the knowledge generated       by two key processing layers, namely, sensor layer and patient physiological      image (PPI) layer, in an independent way, thanks to its modular design. The first      one was defined by a personalized falling detection monitor, on account of the      consequences of falls in chronic renal patients. The second one was analyzed by      means of a PPI's prototype based on a urea compartmental pharmacokinetic model.      The experimental study of the falling detector monitor has been more extensive      than the other because the latter has already been addressed in other works.      RESULTS: The outcomes show, firstly, the capability of the PPIs to provide      integrated and correlated physiological knowledge adapted to each patient, and      secondly, demonstrate the reliability of the impact detection function of the      adaptive human movement monitor compliant with the NEFROTEL paradigm.      CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that NEFROTEL is able to provide knowledge      concerning a patient in a manner that cannot be accomplished by the ordinary      healthcare model at the present time.

PMID- 16647878   - The quality of health care depends, among other factors, on the quality of a      physician's domain knowledge. Since it is impossible to keep up with all new      findings and developments, physicians usually have gaps in their domain      knowledge. To handle exceptional cases, access to the full range of medical      literature is required. The specific literature needed for appropriate treatment       of the patient is described by a physician's information need. Physicians are      often unaware of their information needs. To support them, this paper presents a       first step towards automatically formulating patient-related information needs.      We start investigating how we can model a physician's information needs in      general. Then we propose an approach to instantiate the model into a      representation of a physician's information needs using the patient data as      stored in a medical record. Our experiments show that this approach is feasible.       Since the number of formulated patient-related information needs is rather high,       it has to be reduced. To reduce the number of formulated information needs we      propose the use of additional knowledge. Four types of knowledge are discussed,      viz. (a) knowledge about temporal aspects, (b) domain knowledge, (c) knowledge      about a physician's specialism, and (d) a user model. Future research has to      clarify which type of knowledge (or combination thereof) is most appropriate for       our purpose. It is expected that the resultant set of information needs will have      a manageable size and contributes to the quality of health care.

PMID- 16647877   - BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is a way to support physicians working in resource-poor       settings, providing remote consultations and continuing medical education on      HIV/AIDS care. METHODS: A hybrid E-mail/web support telemedicine service was      created in 2003 at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium, with a      discussion forum hosting more than 170 healthcare professionals from 40 different      countries, generally resource constrained. Interesting posts and recurring      questions from this discussion forum have been elaborated as case studies or     frequently asked questions, available on the website for consultation. Education       and support are also provided through interactive quizzes, user-friendly      guidelines, and policy documents with a particular focus on HIV/AIDS care in      developing countries. RESULTS: From April 2003 to March 2005, 342 questions were       sent from over 17 countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. The vast majority      of these questions (93%) were patient-oriented, with only 7% being general      questions. Of the patient-oriented questions, 49% were related to antiretroviral       therapy, and 44% were related to the diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic      infections. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is a cheap and effective method of      providing clinical support and continuing education to healthcare workers      treating HIV-positive patients in resource-poor settings.

PMID- 16647876   - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common pediatric chronic disease and is estimated to      account for more than 2million emergency department visits per year. Asthma      guidelines have demonstrated improved outcomes, but remain underutilized due to      several barriers. Computerized methods to automatically identify asthma      exacerbations may be beneficial to initiate guideline recommended treatment, but       have not been described. The goal of the study was to examine the accuracy of an       algorithm to identify asthma patients at triage in real-time using only      electronically available data. METHODS: During a 9-month period, the five most      frequent presenting chief complaints for Emergency Department asthma patients      aged 2-18 years were identified and accounted for >95% of asthma visits:      wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, cough, and dyspnea. During a following      1-month period (November 2004), medical records of all patients with one of the      five chief complaints were reviewed to establish a reference standard diagnosis.       An asthma identification algorithm was developed that considered only data      available in electronic format at the time of triage and included the presenting       chief complaint, information from the computerized problem list (past medical      history; current medications, such as beta-agonists, steroids, and other asthma      medications), and ICD-9 billing codes from previous encounters. RESULTS: From      1835 Emergency Department visits, 368 visits (154 with asthma) had one of the      five chief complaints and were included. A problem list was available in 203      (55.2%) and an ICD-9 code in 68 (18.5%) patients. Wheezing accounted for 56.5% of      asthma visits, while fever was the most frequent chief complaint among all      patients (43.8%). The asthma identification algorithm had a sensitivity of 44.8%       (95% CI: 36.8-53.0%), a specificity of 91.6% (CI: 87.0-94.9%), a positive      predictive value of 79.3% (CI: 69.3-87.3%) and a negative predictive value of      69.8% (CI: 64.0-75.1%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.3 (CI:      3.3-8.6) and 0.6 (CI: 0.5-0.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: The simple      identification algorithm demonstrated good accuracy for identifying asthma      episodes. The algorithm may represent a promising and feasible approach to create      computerized reminders or automatic triggers that can facilitate the initiation      of guideline-based asthma treatment in the Emergency Department.

PMID- 16621684   - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in men and is a      major cause of mortality in developed countries. Detection of prostate carcinoma       at an early stage is crucial for successful treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A      method for the analysis of transrectal ultrasound images aimed at computer-aided       diagnosis of prostate cancer is tested in this paper. First, two classifiers      based on k-nearest neighbors and Hidden Markov models are compared. Second, the      diagnostic capacity of our system is tested by means of a set of experiments      where humans with varying degrees of experience classified a set of ultrasound      images with and without the aid of the computer-aided system. The corpus used in       this study was specifically acquired for this purpose. It consists of 4944      ultrasound images corresponding to 303 patients, and is publicly available for     non-commercial use upon request. RESULTS: The best classification results achieve      an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 61.6%. However, the       diagnostic capacity of an expert urologist using the computer-aided system      improves only slightly compared with his/her capacity without the aid of the      system. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulty of this task, the obtained results      indicate that discrimination between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue is      possible to a certain degree. The computer-aided system helps an inexperienced      user to make a better diagnosis, however it must be able to perform better in      order to be useful in a real-world clinical context.

PMID- 16621683   - INTRODUCTION: Stockholm County Council is the largest health care provider in      Sweden with an annual budget of US$ 5 billion and catering the needs of a      metropolitan population of 2 million people. About 10% of health care costs are      used on drugs. In 1996 Stockholm County Council decided to address the main      problems associated with the process and the quality of drug prescribing.      METHODS: A multiyear strategy was designed, including the establishment of a      strong evidence-based organisation, Drug and Therapeutics Committees and      editorial resources to adapt information to the IT-media and the development of      the IT-architecture. The development and implementation of computerized tools      such as a physician drug order entry system including decision support, a drug      information website and electronic transmission of prescriptions were started in       1996. RESULTS: The implementation was slow at the point-of-care units. It took      about 6 years before the implementation process gained speed. In September 2005      almost 1000 doctors could use the decision support system for prescribing drugs      and more than 70% of all prescriptions were transmitted electronically in our     region. CONCLUSIONS: The work with the strategy has shown that improvements in      drug use can be accomplished by providing access to simple, rapid and safe      electronic tools, but the information provided has to be associated with      well-recognized regional and national expert organisations.

PMID- 16621682   - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This research explored the adoption and the utilisation of      telemedicine (TM) in two healthcare organizations (HCOs) in New Zealand (NZ). The      research utilised the technological innovation theories, as a guiding theoretical      framework, to develop a set of potential determinants which could assist in      understanding the adoption and the depth of the TM phenomenon in the two HCOs.      METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Using case studies design, the findings across the two      cases revealed that TM was adopted according to its cost-benefit analysis.      Although this approach was found to be important in assessing the adoption of TM,      not considering the importance of other factors, highlighted in this research,      such as the compatibility and the trialability aspects of the TM technology had a      detrimental impact on the success of TM in both cases. CONCLUSION: This research       stressed the need for the tight coupling between the roles of both the      administrative and the clinical managers in HCOs in order to champion TM adoption      and diffusion and to overcome many of the barriers that could hinder telemedicine      success in HCOs in NZ. The research points to other implications with respect to       the literature and highlights further research in this important area.

PMID- 16621681   - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was (1) to identify the requirements for     syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems arising from events such      as the SARS outbreak in March 2003, and the deliberate spread of Bacillus      anthracis, or anthrax, in the US in 2001; and (2) to use these specifications as       input to the construction of a system intended to meet these requirements. An      important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable      disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about      individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. METHODS: The      method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of      analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The      requirements were established from earlier projects' conclusions and analysis of       disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of      syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was tested on simulated      EHR databases generated from microbiology laboratory data. RESULTS: A      requirements list that a syndromic and disease surveillance system should meet,      and an open source system, "The Snow Agent system", has been developed. The Snow       Agent system is a distributed system for monitoring the status of a population's       health by distributing processes to, and extracting epidemiological data directly      from, the electronic health records (EHR) system in a geographic area.      CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic and disease surveillance tools should be able to operate      at all levels in the health systems and across national borders. Such systems      should avoid transferring patient identifiable data, support two-way      communications and be able to define and incorporate new and unknown diseases and      syndrome definitions that should be reported by the system. The initial tests of       the Snow Agent system shows that it will easily scale to national level in      Norway.

PMID- 16600671   - This paper presents a technical framework to support the development and      installation of system for content-based image retrieval in medical applications       (IRMA). A strict separation of feature extraction, feature storage, feature      comparison, and the user interfaces is suggested. This allows to reuse      implemented components in different retrieval algorithms, which improves software      quality, shortens the development cycle for applications, and allows to introduce      standardized end-user interfaces. Based on the proposed framework, the IRMA      engine has been established, which is currently used to evaluate content-based      retrieval methods on a collection of 20,000 medical and 135,000 non-medical      images.

PMID- 16597509   - BACKGROUND: Online evidence databases can provide access to high quality evidence      at the point of care, making evidence-based practice more achievable. A      discipline-specific online bibliographic database called OTseeker     (www.otseeker.com) was designed for use by occupational therapists. The database       is free, and contains citations and abstracts of systematic reviews, and      critically appraised randomized controlled trials relevant to occupational      therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate search practices of      database users, their views on its functionality, and the reported impact, if      any, on their practice from using OTseeker. DESIGN: An online survey, placed on      the database website for 30 days. SAMPLE: Potential participants were users of      OTseeker during a 30-day period. A total of 498 people who had used the database       more than once from over 40 countries completed the survey. RESULTS: Three      hundred and nine (62%) participants believed that OTseeker had improved their     ability to locate research about the effectiveness of occupational therapy      interventions, and 92 (19%) agreed that the information in the database had      contributed to a change in practice. Those reporting no practice changes agreed      that use of OTseeker had improved their knowledge generally (n=189; 38%),      confirmed their practice (n=75; 15%), or revealed that there was insufficient      research relevant to their search topic (n=92; 19%). Features of the database      which helped respondents locate research evidence included: having      discipline-specific content, providing critical appraisal ratings for randomized       controlled trials, and presenting search results ranked for methodological      quality. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the value of a discipline-specific,      online database for helping occupational therapists locate high quality research       evidence. Information located on databases such as OTseeker can help change or     confirm practice, and improve knowledge.

PMID- 16569509   - PURPOSE: Veterinary medicine and human health are inextricably intertwined.      Effective tracking of veterinary information - veterinary informatics - impacts      not only veterinary medicine, but also public health, informatics research, and      clinical care. However, veterinary informatics has received little attention from      the general biomedical informatics community. METHODS: To identify both active      and under-researched areas in veterinary informatics, we retrieved Medical      Subject Heading (MeSH) descriptors for veterinary informatics-related citations      and analyzed them by topic category, animal type, and journal. RESULTS: We found       that the categories of veterinary informatics with the most growth were      information/bibliographical retrieval, hardware/programming, and      radiology/imaging. Less than two articles per year were published in the areas of      computerized veterinary medical records, clinical decision support, standards,      and controlled vocabularies. Veterinary informatics articles primarily address      production animals such as cattle and sheep, and companion animals such as cats      and dogs. Six journals account for 31% of the veterinary informatics literature,       35 journals account for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Veterinary informatics remains an      embryonic field with relatively few publications. With the exception of      radiology/imaging, published articles are primarily focused on non-clinical areas      such as hardware/programming and information retrieval. There are very few      publications on controlled vocabularies, standards, methodologies for integrating      disparate systems, computerized medical records, clinical decision support      systems, and system usability. The lack of publications in these areas may hamper     efforts to collect and track animal health data at a time when such data are      potentially critical to human health.

PMID- 16567121   - PURPOSE: Computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems hold the promise of      significant improvements to health care delivery and patient care. The      implementation of such systems is costly and complex. The purpose of this paper     is to review current evidence of the impact of CPOE on hospital pathology      services. METHODS: This paper presents a review of the literature (1990-August      2004) about CPOE systems and identifies indicators for measuring the impact of      CPOE on pathology services. RESULTS: Nineteen studies which contained some form      of 'control' group, were identified. They featured a variety of designs including      randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and before and after studies. We      categorised these into three groups: studies comparing pathology CPOE systems      (with no decision support) to paper systems; pathology CPOE systems (with      decision support) to paper systems; and pathology CPOE systems with specific      pathology features compared to systems without those features. We identified 10      areas of impact assessment and 39 indicators used to measure the impact of CPOE      on different stages of the pathology test ordering and reporting process.      CONCLUSION: We conclude that while some data suggest that CPOE systems are      beneficial for clinical and laboratory work processes, these data are limited,      and further research is needed. Few data are available regarding the impact of      CPOE on patient outcomes.

PMID- 16567120   - BACKGROUND: With increasing computerization of nursing records in Japan,      standardization of nursing terminology is becoming imperative. Although some      efforts have been made to formalize description of nursing practice in Japan with      the International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP), lack of effective      description tools has impacted negatively on the initiatives. PURPOSE: To develop      and evaluate an ontological approach that could be used to facilitate the      description of nursing practice in Japan with the ICNP. METHODOLOGY: An      ontology-based support system was developed using Protege-2000, mainly by the      following three steps: (1) representing a standard classification of nursing      practice (the Nursing Master) in Japan; (2) representing a Japanese version of      the ICNP; (3) designing an ontology-based framework. A heuristic matching      algorithm was developed to automatically match the action labels in the Nursing      Master with the terms of the eight axes of the ICNP Nursing Actions      Classification. A preliminary evaluation was performed to examine the usefulness       of the system. RESULTS: High hit rate was shown on the ICNP axes ActionType,      Target, and Location. The evaluation indicated that 51.7+/-5.8% (mean+/-S.D.) of       the action labels with only one action type were properly matched, and that in      80+/-4% (mean+/-S.D.) of action labels with more than one action type, at least      one valid action type was matched correctly. CONCLUSION: The ontology-based      approach using a frame-based knowledge representation system (e.g., Protege-2000)      is useful for supporting the formal description of nursing practice in Japan with      the ICNP.

PMID- 16564737   - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare organisations are nowadays expecting the support of IT      in the daily routines. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are in use in some      healthcare organisations but in an irregular and unplanned way. The aim of the      present study was to describe nurses' and nurse students' demands of functions      and usability in a PDA. METHODS: Interviews were made with 12 nurses at the      County Hospital of Kalmar and a questionnaire was given to nurse students (n=84)       in their last, i.e. third, year at the Department of Health and Behavioural      Sciences, University of Kalmar. RESULTS: There was a need for nurses to make the       information in general more rich and efficient by means of a PDA. In a PDA, the      nurses and nurse students expected access to information about the patients,      knowledge resources and functions for their daily work. CONCLUSIONS: The nurses      and nurse students had high expectations of a PDA for information retrieval. A      PDA has the potential to be accepted as a supportive tool in healthcare      organisations if it contains the demanded content which must be adapted to the      users' needs and the general IT-system used, and the PDA must have a user     friendly design.

PMID- 16542869   - PURPOSE: Today, the need for health informatics training for health care      professionals is acknowledged and educational opportunities for these      professionals are increasing. To contribute to these efforts, a new initiative      was undertaken by the Medical Informatics Program of the University of      Amsterdam-Academic Medical Center and IPHIE (IPhiE)-the International Partnership      for Health Informatics Education. In the year 2004, a summer school on health      informatics was organized for advanced medical students from all over the world.       METHODS: We elaborate on the goals and the program for this summer school. In      developing the course, we followed the international guidelines of the      International Medical Informatics Association-IMIA. Students provided feedback      for the course through both summative and formative evaluations. As a result of      these evaluations, we outline the lessons we have learned and what consequences      these results have had in revising the course. RESULTS: Overall the results of      both the summative and formative evaluation of the summer school showed that we      succeeded in the goals we set at the beginning of the course. Students highly      appreciated the course content and indicated that the course fulfilled their     educational needs. The decision support and image processing computer practicums       however proved too high level. We therefore will redesign these practicums to      competence requirements of medical doctors as defined by IMIA. All participants      recommended the summer school event to other students. CONCLUSIONS: Our     experiences demonstrated a true need for health informatics education among      medical students and that even a 2 weeks course can fulfill health informatics      educational needs of these future physicians. Further establishment of health      informatics courses for other health professions is recommended.

PMID- 16533618   - PURPOSES: The development of a national protocol to formalize the screening of      Dutch cancer survivors on potential late cancer treatment effects and the medical      terminology used in describing the patient follow up procedures. METHODS: A      combined evidence-based and qualitative approach, the Glaser's State of the Art      Strategy, was used to reach consensus on how to screen Dutch cancer survivors on       late cancer treatment effects. A core working group set up a first proposal of a       screening protocol and a handbook of medical term definitions by incorporating      available research evidence (1980-2003), clinical expertise and definitions from       Dutch medical dictionaries and textbooks. External experts reviewed this proposal      in a cycle of two postal and two discussion rounds. The follow-up procedures and       medical term definitions described in the draft screening protocol were to be      accepted if consensus among external experts was > or =50%. RESULTS: A protocol      for screening cancer survivors on late cancer treatment effects was developed      describing the follow-up procedures for cancer survivors according to previous      therapeutic exposures. Four hundred and twenty one medical terms were used in      describing these follow-up procedures. One hundred and fifteen of these terms      were classified as multi-interpretable and 101 of these terms were defined. No      definitions could be found for the remaining 14 medical terms. CONCLUSIONS: We      succeeded in reaching consensus throughout The Netherlands on a protocol to      screen cancer survivors on late cancer treatment effects. This protocol is now in      use by all Dutch outpatient clinics and warrants that the screening of cancer     survivors is consistent across The Netherlands. The screening protocol specifies       in detail how screening of cancer survivors should take place and can therefore      be used by clinicians who were not involved in the consensus study.

PMID- 16524767   - BACKGROUND: Context - the combined effect of factors such as physician type,      clinical setting, and guideline characteristics - influences the ability of      automated decision support (ADS) to improve physician compliance with clinical      practice guidelines (CPGs). Our goal was to determine whether research about the       utility of ADS for promoting CPG compliance is contextually applicable to United       States physicians. METHODS: We extracted information about physicians, settings,       and guidelines from all articles published in the last 10 years that describe      original research about the use of ADS to promote CPG compliance. The extracted      information was compared to the range of practice contexts seen in the United      States. RESULTS: Nearly two-thirds (65.3%) of papers described studies conducted       in an academic setting, but only 11% of physicians report academic affiliations      (p<0.0001). Physician reimbursement structure is often not reported. Salaried      physicians were explicitly included as subjects in 14% of articles, but make up      45% of US physicians (p<0.0001). There are little data about the generalizability      of ADS research to emergency care settings (6% of articles), and nursing home or       skilled nursing facilities (10% of articles). Finally, ADS has not been studied      at all in several epidemiologically important disease categories. CONCLUSION: The      literature does not adequately address some physician, setting, and guideline      contexts. Before making policy or spending decisions based on the effectiveness      of ADS, additional research is needed to determine whether ADS research can be      generalized to under-represented contexts.

PMID- 16488663   - BACKGROUND: Health care systems will integrate new computing paradigms in the      coming years. Context-awareness computing is a research field which often refers       to health care as an interesting and rich area of application. AIM: Through a      survey of the research literature, we intended to derive an objective view of the      actual dynamism of context awareness in health care, and to identify strengths      and weaknesses in this field. METHODS: After discussing definitions of context,      we proposed a simple framework to analyse and characterize the use of context      through three main axes. We then focused on context-awareness computing and      reported on the main teams working in this area. We described some of the      context-awareness projects in health care. A deeper analysis of the      hospital-based projects demonstrated the gap between recommendations expressed      for modelling context awareness and the actual use in a prototype. Finally, we      identified pitfalls encountered in this area of research. RESULTS: A number of      opportunities remain for this evolving field of research. We found relatively few      groups with such a specific focus. As yet there is no consensus as to the most      appropriate models or attributes to include in context awareness. We conclude      that a greater understanding of which aspects of context are important in a      health care setting is required; the inherent sociotechnical nature of      context-aware applications in health care; and the need to draw on a number of      disciplines to conduct this research.

PMID- 16483837   - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of literature about health information systems (HIS)       in "developing" countries, including Vietnam. However, computerization and      network development are proceeding in these places, although not in a systematic,      transparent way. OBJECTIVE: This is a preliminary overview of HIS's and      healthcare communications in Vietnam's four-tiered public healthcare system. It      is to indicate the direction that nation might take in order to establish a      modern, standards-compliant, national HIS. METHODS: We conducted site visits and       interviews in Hanoi and nearby provinces. Additional information was derived from      publications of the Vietnamese government and the United Nations. RESULTS: Many      of the top-level "central" hospitals have HIS's, although their quality and daily      usage varies. Fewer provincial hospitals have networks; district hospitals have a      few stand-alone computers, and commune health centers have no computers. Patients      often go directly to higher-level providers, due to a widely held perception of      better care at such sites. Communications among healthcare units are largely on      paper, consisting mostly of administrative matters and some hand-written patient       referrals. Telephones are used for discussions of specific matters. Internet      connections are almost all dial-up and often belong to individual staff members      rather than the healthcare units. Lower-level units derive much of their general       medical information from television and newspapers. However, there is      considerable interest in computerization among healthcare workers at all levels.       CONCLUSION: Familiarization with computerized communications, i.e., training and       hardware at all healthcare levels, must be the first step towards a modern      healthcare communications network in Vietnam. The skills to do this already      exist. The aim of such a network must be to raise the level of information and      quality of care at the lower levels. Adherence to international standards, such      as HL7, from the beginning would enable the country to bypass many years of      haphazard development.

PMID- 16478675   - PURPOSE: Drawing on the classical theory of diffusion of innovations advanced by       Rogers [E.M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations, 4th ed., Free Press, New York, NY,      1995] and on the theory of barriers to innovation [P. Attewell, Technology      diffusion and organizational learning: the case of business computing. Organ.      Sci. 3 (1992) 1-19; H. Tanriverdi, C.S. Iacono, Knowledge barriers to diffusion      of telemedicine. Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Information       Systems, Charlotte, NC, 1999, pp. 39-50; S. Nambisan, Y.-M. Wang, Roadblocks to      web technology adoption? Commun. ACM, 42 (1) (1999) 98-101], this study seeks a      better understanding of challenges faced in PACS implementations in hospitals and      of the strategies required to ensure their success. METHODS: To attain this      objective, we describe and analyze the process used to adopt and implement PACS      at two Canadian hospitals. RESULTS: Our findings clearly demonstrate the      importance of treating any PACS deployment not simply as a rollout of new      technology but as a project that will transform the organization. Proponents of      these projects must not lose sight of the fact that, even if technological      complexity represents a significant issue, it must not garner all the project      team's attention. This situation is even more dangerous, inasmuch as the greatest      risk to the implementation often lies elsewhere. It would also appear to be      crucial to anticipate and address organizational and behavioral challenges from      the very first phase of the innovation process, in order to ensure that all      participants will be committed to the project. CONCLUSIONS: In order to maximize       the likelihood of PACS success, it appears crucial to adopt a proactive      implementation strategy, one that takes into consideration all the technical,      economic, organizational, and human factors, and does so from the first phase of       the innovation process.

PMID- 16473548   - INTRODUCTION: Patients can be used as a resource to enter their own pertinent      medical information. This study will evaluate the feasibility of an intelligent      computer medical history-taking device directed at patients in the emergency      department (ED). METHODS: Two of the authors (MB, RE) developed an expert system       that can take patient-directed medical histories. Patients interacted with the      computer in the ED waiting room while it gathered a medical history based on      chief complaint (CC). A survey was completed post history. A sub-study assessed      the computer's ability to take an adequate history for an index CC. We compared      the computer and emergency physician histories for the presence or absence of      important historical elements. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients used the interactive      computer system. The mean time to complete the history was 5 min and 32s +/- 1      min and 21s. The patient response rate was 97%. Over 83% felt that the computer     was very easy to use and over 92% would very much use the computer again. A total      of 15 patients with abdominal pain (index CC) were evaluated for the sub-study.      The computer history asked 90+/-7%, and the emergency physician asked 55+/-18%,      of the important historical elements. These groups were statistically different      with a p-value of <0.00001. CONCLUSION: This feasibility study has shown that the      computer history-taking device is well accepted by patients and that such a      system can be integrated into the normal process of patient triage without      delaying patient care. Such a system can serve as an initial mode for     documentation and data acquisition directly from the patient.

PMID- 16469531   - BACKGROUND: Among women who present with urinary complaints, only 50% are found      to have urinary tract infection. Individual urinary symptoms and urinalysis are      not sufficiently accurate to discriminate those with and without the diagnosis.      METHODS: We used artificial neural networks (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithms      to evolve combinations of clinical variables optimized for predicting urinary      tract infection. The ANN were applied to 212 women ages 19-84 who presented to an      ambulatory clinic with urinary complaints. Urinary tract infection was defined in      separate models as uropathogen counts of > or =10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)      per milliliter, and counts of > or =10(2) CFU per milliliter. RESULTS:      Five-variable sets were evolved that classified cases of urinary tract infection       and non-infection with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas that      ranged from 0.853 (for uropathogen counts of > or =10(5) CFU per milliliter) to      0.792 (for uropathogen counts of > or =10(2) CFU per milliliter). Predictor     variables (which included urinary frequency, dysuria, foul urine odor, symptom      duration, history of diabetes, leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick, and red      blood cells, epithelial cells, and bacteria on urinalysis) differed depending on       the pathogen count that defined urinary tract infection. Network influence      analyses showed that some variables predicted urine infection in unexpected ways,      and interacted with other variables in making predictions. CONCLUSIONS: ANN and      genetic algorithms can reveal parsimonious variable sets accurate for predicting       urinary tract infection, and novel relationships between symptoms, urinalysis      findings, and infection.

PMID- 16460995   - OBJECTIVE: To examine how the pre-existing doctor-patient relationship predicts      conceptually distinct service use within an Interactive Cancer Communication      System (ICCS) for underserved women with breast cancer and in turn how service      utilization influences the doctor-patient relationship. METHODS: Study sample      included 231 recently diagnosed, lower income breast cancer patients.      Participants were provided a free computer, Internet access and training in how      to use an ICCS called the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS)      "Living with Breast Cancer" program. Survey data was collected at pre-test and      4-months after using the system, and use data about how women used the system was      also collected. RESULTS: The only statistically significant predictor of service       use was that patients with a more negative appraisal about the doctor-patient      relationship used the Ask an Expert service more frequently, and there were      trends toward a more negative appraisal of the doctor-patient relationship being       associated with higher use of Information and Interactive services. Conversely,      there was a trend toward a more positive appraisal predicting higher use of the      Discussion Group service. In terms of statistically significant effects, more      frequent utilization of Information services was associated with a more positive       appraisal of the doctor relationship. CONCLUSION: While a more negative      perception of the doctor-patient relationships at pre-test was associated with      higher use of most of the conceptually distinct services within this ICCS, use of      the Information services was associated with having a more positive appraisal of       the doctor-patient relationship at post-test suggesting that high-quality      information on the Internet can serve to improve patients' satisfaction with      their doctor.

PMID- 16458066   - OBJECTIVE: To determine the decay rate of Uniform Record Locators (URLs) in the      reference section of biomedical informatics journals. METHODS: URL references      were collected from printed journal articles of the first and middle issues of      1999-2004 and electronically available in-press articles in January 2005. We      limited this set to five biomedical informatics journals: Artificial Intelligence      in Medicine, International Journal of Medical Informatics, Journal of the      American Medical Informatics Association: JAMIA, Methods of Information in      Medicine, and Journal of Biomedical Informatics. During a 1-month period, URL      access attempts were performed eight times a day at regular intervals. RESULTS:      Of the 19,108 references extracted from 606 printed and 86 in-press articles,      1112 (5.8%) references contained a URL. Of the 1049 unique URLs, 726 (69.2%) were      alive, 230 (21.9%) were dead, and 93 (8.9%) were comatose. URLs from in-press      articles included 212 URLs, of which 169 (79.7%) were alive, 21 (9.9%) were dead,      and 22 (10.4%) were comatose. The average annual decay, or link rot, rate was      5.4%. CONCLUSION: The URL decay rate in biomedical informatics journals is high.       A commonly accepted strategy for the permanent archival of digital information      referenced in scholarly publications is urgently needed.

PMID- 16455299   - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The paper aims to develop further insights into the      process of implementation of IT in health care by describing findings from a      study of a trial implementation of a newly developed electronic medication plan      (EMP) in three hospitals in a county in Denmark. A sociotechnical perspective is       applied to data acquired by the qualitative methods of participant observation      and semi-structured open-ended interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of fit      between IT technology and work processes in health care involves the      establishment of new organizational structures that cut across the existing      divisionalized hospital organization and a detailed alignment of artefact,      functionality and work process. This process can be furthered by supporting      'communities of practice', i.e. informal groups of engaged clinicians. A      sociotechnical perspective is beneficial to the analysis of such processes.

PMID- 16406791   - BACKGROUND: Routinely collected clinical data is increasingly used for health      service management, audit, and research. Even apparently anonymised data are      subject to data protection. The relevant principles were set out in a treaty of      the Council of Europe and subsequent policy has been based on these. However,      little has been written about implementing policy and the role of health      informaticians in this process. OBJECTIVE: To define the elements of an effective      implementation policy; the role of the health informatician in protecting      processed clinical data. METHODS: We performed a literature review of      bibliographic databases, a manual search of the major medical informatics      associations' websites, relevant working groups and an affiliated journal.      Fifty-four papers relevant to implementation were identified. RESULTS: The      effective implementation of policy requires consideration of technical,      organisational, personnel and professional issues. However, there is no clearly      defined formula for successful implementation of data protection policy.      CONCLUSIONS: Patients and professionals need a system they can trust, and      processes that can be easily incorporated into everyday practice. The lack of a      core generalisable theory or strong professional code in health informatics      limits the ability of the health informaticians to implement policy.

PMID- 16388982   - PURPOSE: To present the lessons learned from an evaluation of a comprehensive      telehealth project regarding success factors and evaluation methodology for such       projects. METHODS: A recent experience with the evaluation of new telehealth      services in BC, Canada, is summarized. Two domains of clinical applications, as      well as educational and administrative uses, and the project environment were      evaluated. In order to contribute to the success of the project, the evaluation      included formative and summative approaches employing qualitative and      quantitative methods with data collection from telehealth events, participants      and existing databases. The evaluation had to be carried out under severe      budgetary and time constraints. We therefore deliberately chose a broad ranging      exploratory approach within a framework provided, and generated questions to be      answered on the basis of initial observations and participant driven interviews      with progressively more focused and detailed data gathering, including perusal of      a variety of existing data sources. A unique feature was an economic evaluation      using static simulation models. RESULTS: The evaluation yielded rich and detailed      data, which were able to explain a number of unanticipated findings. One clinical      application domain was cancelled after 6 months, the other continues. The factors      contributing to success include: Focus on chronic conditions which require visual      information for proper management. Involvement of established teams in regular     scheduled visits or in sessions scheduled well in advance. Problems arose with:      Ad hoc applications, in particular under emergency conditions. Applications that       disregard established referral patterns. Applications that support only part of a      unit's services. The latter leads to the service mismatch dilemma (SMMD) with the      end result that even those e-health services provided are not used. The problems       encountered were compounded by issues arising from the manner in which the      telehealth services had been introduced, in particular the lack of time for     preparation and establishment of routine use. Educational applications had      significant clinical benefits. Administrative applications generated savings      which exceeded the substantial capital investment and made educational and      clinical applications available at variable cost. CONCLUSION: Evaluation under     severe constraints can yield rich information. The identified success factors,      including provision of an overarching architecture and infrastructure, strong      program management, thorough needs analysis and detailing applications to match      the identified needs should improve the sustainability of e-health projects.      Insights gained: Existing assumptions before the study was conducted: Evaluation       has to proceed from identified questions according to a rigorous experimental      design. Emergency and trauma services in remote regions can and should be      supported via telehealth based on video-conferencing. Educational applications of      telehealth directed at providers are beneficial for recruitment and retention of       providers in remote areas. Insights gained by the study: An exploratory approach       to evaluation using a multiplicity of methods can yield rich and detailed      information even under severe constraints. Ad hoc and emergency clinical      applications of telehealth can present problems unless they are based on      thorough, detailed analyses of environment and need, conform to established      practice patterns and rely on established trusting collaborative relationships.      Less difficult applications should be introduced before attempting to support use      under emergency conditions. Educational applications are of interest beyond the      provider community to patients, family and community members, and have clinical      value. In large, sparsely populated areas with difficult travel conditions      administrative applications by themselves generate savings that compensate for     the substantial capital investment for telehealth required for clinical      applications.

PMID- 16386460   - PURPOSE: To determine the speed, accuracy, ease of use, and user satisfaction of       various electronic data entry platforms for use in the collection of mammography       clinical trials data. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Four electronic data entry platforms       were tested: standalone personal digital assistant (PDA), Tablet PC, digitizer     Tablet/PDA Hybrid (DTP Hybrid), and digital pen (d-pen). Standard paper data      entry was used as control. Each of five radiologist readers was assigned to enter     interpretations for 20 screening mammograms using three out of the five data      entry methods. Assistants recorded both start and stop data entry times of the      radiologists and the number of help requests made. Data were checked for     handwriting recognition accuracy for the d-pen platform using handwriting      verification software. A user satisfaction survey was administered at the end of       each platform reading session. RESULTS: Tablet PC and d-pen were statistically      equivalent to conventional pen and paper in initial data entry speed. Average      verification time for d-pen was significantly less than secondary electronic data      entry of paper forms (p-value <0.001). The number of errors in handwriting      recognition for d-pen was less than secondary electronic data entry of the paper       forms data. Users were most satisfied with Tablet PC, d-pen, and conventional pen      and paper for data entry. CONCLUSIONS: Tablet PC and d-pen are equally fast and      easy-to-use data entry methods that are well tolerated by radiologist users.      Handwriting recognition review and correction for the d-pen is significantly      faster and more accurate than secondary manual keyboard and mouse data entry.

PMID- 16377235   - OBJECTIVE: After a review of the existing practical solution available to the      citizen to retrieve eHealth document, the paper describes an original specialized      search engine WRAPIN. METHOD: WRAPIN uses advanced cross lingual information      retrieval technologies to check information quality by synthesizing medical      concepts, conclusions and references contained in the health literature, to      identify accurate, relevant sources. Thanks to MeSH terminology [1] (Medical      Subject Headings from the U.S. National Library of Medicine) and advanced      approaches such as conclusion extraction from structured document, reformulation       of the query, WRAPIN offers to the user a privileged access to navigate through      multilingual documents without language or medical prerequisites. RESULTS: The      results of an evaluation conducted on the WRAPIN prototype show that results of      the WRAPIN search engine are perceived as informative 65% (59% for a      general-purpose search engine), reliable and trustworthy 72% (41% for the other     engine) by users. But it leaves room for improvement such as the increase of      database coverage, the explanation of the original functionalities and an      audience adaptability. CONCLUSION: Thanks to evaluation outcomes, WRAPIN is now      in exploitation on the HON web site (http://www.healthonnet.org), free of charge.      Intended to the citizen it is a good alternative to general-purpose search      engines when the user looks up trustworthy health and medical information or     wants to check automatically a doubtful content of a Web page.

PMID- 16359916   - INTRODUCTION: The development of numerical-spatial routines is frequently      required to solve complex community health problems. Community health assessment       (CHA) professionals who use information technology need a complete system that is      capable of supporting the development of numerical-spatial routines. BACKGROUND:       Currently, there is no decision support system (DSS) that is effectively able to       accomplish this task as the majority of public health geospatial information      systems (GIS) are based on traditional (relational) database architecture.      On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a multidimensional data warehouse      technique that is commonly used as a decision support system in standard      industry. OLAP alone is not sufficient for solving numerical-spatial problems      that frequently occur in CHA research. Coupling it with GIS technology offers the      potential for a very powerful and useful system. METHODOLOGY: A community health       OLAP cube was created by integrating health and population data from various      sources. OLAP and GIS technologies were then combined to develop the Spatial OLAP      Visualization and Analysis Tool (SOVAT). RESULTS: The synergy of numerical and      spatial environments within SOVAT is shown through an elaborate and easy-to-use      drag and drop and direct manipulation graphical user interface (GUI). Community      health problem-solving examples (routines) using SOVAT are shown through a series      of screen shots. DISCUSSION: The impact of the difference between SOVAT and      existing GIS public health applications can be seen by considering the      numerical-spatial problem-solving examples. These examples are facilitated using       OLAP-GIS functions. These functions can be mimicked in existing GIS public      applications, but their performance and system response would be significantly      worse since GIS is based on traditional (relational) backend. CONCLUSION:      OLAP-GIS system offer great potential for powerful numerical-spatial decision      support in community health analysis. The functionality of an OLAP-GIS system has      been shown through a series of example community health numerical-spatial      problems. Efforts are now focused on determining its usability during      human-computer interaction (HCI). Later work will focus on performing summative      evaluations comparing SOVAT to existing decision support tools used during      community health assessment research.

PMID- 16356766   - OBJECTIVE: Public health surveillance applications are central to the collection,      analysis and dissemination of disease and health information. As these      applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications      must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It      is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements.      METHODS: We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance      application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements.      These components are configured to produce services used in the development of      public health applications. RESULTS: A layered software architecture, the ALPHA      architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health      applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance      applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease      surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory management.      CONCLUSIONS: We have found that a software architecture that addresses      requirements on policies, security and flexibility facilitates the development of      configurable public health applications. By creating this architecture, key      success factors, such as reducing cost and time-to-market of applications,      adapting to changing surveillance targets and increasing user efficiency are      achieved.

PMID- 16343988   - BACKGROUND: Access to reliable information is the most cost-effective and      achievable strategy for sustainable improvement in health care. While several      studies have described practitioners' information seeking behavior in developed      countries, literature from developing countries is lacking. The aims of the study      were: (i) to determine the most influential type of information for health      workers' and planners' decision making; (ii) to establish the practitioners'      evaluation of the availability and quality of this important information; and      (iii) to establish the most commonly used/accessible sources of the information      relevant for decision making in Uganda. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires      were sent to 610 health workers, planners, and administrators at the national,      district and health facility levels in four districts in Uganda. Respondents were      reminded three times, after which non-response was registered. Data were entered,      cleaned and analysed using SPSS version 12.0. Logistic regression analysis was      used to test for differences in responses. RESULTS: The response rate was 67.7%      (413). The respondents indicated that personal experience (79%), discussion with       colleagues (76%) and national policy and treatment guidelines (75%) were most      influential when making decisions in health care and planning. They reported that      most of the epidemiological information was available and of relatively good      quality but there was lack of information about distribution of benefit,      segregated demographic data, and social values. The most often used sources of      information included; discussions with colleagues (89%), doctors' statements      (85%) and text books (77%). The least frequently used sources were the internet      and the library. This varied with respondents' designation and region of origin.       CONCLUSIONS: Health planners and practitioners lack some of the information      relevant for decision making. They tend to rely on the national policy and      treatment guidelines, discussion with colleagues, and personal experience. Most      frequently used sources of information are similar to previous studies. The      variation in the frequency of use of the different sources of research      information necessitates research to understand the barriers and careful planning      of health information delivery to ensure equitable access.

PMID- 16338169   - BACKGROUND: Health maintenance is crucial for preventing morbidity and premature       mortality, but many patients do not receive preventive services at recommended      intervals. One reason for this is the lack of up-to-date information accurately      reflecting patients' history. Electronic health records (EHRs) can be useful, but      are often incomplete. Patient input has the potential to improve the accuracy of       this information. In this study, we assessed the current state of EHR     completeness for preventive services and the added value of patient reported      information. METHODS: Participants were sent a survey, pre-populated with health       maintenance procedure information from their EHRs. They were asked to review this      information and indicate whether it was accurate or if they had a procedure done       more recently. Of 1098 patients recruited from a primary care practice, 163      returned the survey. When a patient reported a more recent test than was noted in      the EHR, researchers updated the EHR to reflect the additional information. Data       were also gathered from the EHR 6 months after surveys were completed to analyze       whether providing due test information encouraged patients to get tested and      vaccinated. A review of medical records was performed on a control group to      analyze differences in adherence to preventive guidelines between those that were      notified of their overdue status and those who were not notified. RESULTS: The      EHR was frequently incomplete when compared to patient report. In particular,      many patients were misidentified as being overdue for health maintenance      procedures when they had obtained them in other places. Showing patients their     information resulted in little impact on overall adherence. However, with the      cumulative effects of additional patient-reported procedures and procedures      performed after the survey, intervention patients had higher documented adherence      rates for every procedure than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Health maintenance      data in EHRs were often incomplete. Patients were often able to provide useful      information, demonstrating the value of patient contributions in keeping records       up-to-date.

PMID- 16326134   - Attention to contextual factors is essential to the conduct of high quality      informatics field research. This is particularly true when the research focus is       on complex information technology innovations like computerized provider order     entry (CPOE) systems. From a field research perspective, CPOE systems are      considered an organizational intervention. They are designed, implemented and      used within an organizational context that encompasses cultural, economic, social      and physical aspects. It is essential that informatics researchers address      contextual factors when assessing the impact of CPOE systems. Inclusion of      organizational contextual factors in CPOE system field studies permits a more      accurate evaluation of the true impact these systems have on medication practice       processes and outcomes. The goals of this paper are to: (1) identify contextual      factors that influenced implementation of a federally-funded field study      undertaken to examine the impact of a community hospital CPOE system on      medication error outcomes; and (2) describe how these contextual factors      influenced study methodology and implementation.

PMID- 16324882   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of an automated algorithm for scoring      physicians' responses to open-ended clinical vignettes against explicit,      evidence-based quality criteria. METHODS: One hundred sixteen physicians      completed a total of 915 computerized clinical vignettes at 4 sites. Each      vignette simulated an outpatient primary care visit for one of 8 different      clinical cases. The automated algorithm scored disease-specific quality criterion      as done or not done by recognizing the presence or absence of predefined patterns      in the physician's text response to the vignette. Scores generated by the      automated algorithm for each criterion were compared to scores generated by      trained human abstractors. Vignette responses were divided into development and      test sets. Percentage agreement between automated and manual scores was computed       separately for the development and test sets. Sensitivity and specificity were      calculated. Costs of automated and manual scoring were compared. RESULTS:      Accuracy of the algorithm exceeds 90% for both the development and test sets, and      is high for care items that were deemed either necessary or unnecessary, across      diverse clinical cases, and for all domains of the outpatient clinical encounter.      The sensitivity of the automated scoring algorithm is 89.0%, and specificity is      93.5%. Automated scoring is approximately 84% less expensive than manual scoring.      CONCLUSION: Automated scoring of computerized vignettes appears feasible and      accurate. Computerized vignettes incorporating accurate automated scoring offer     the promise of a highly standardized but relatively inexpensive measurement tool       for a wide range of quality assessments within and across health systems.

PMID- 16309951   - PURPOSE: Continuing professional development is an integral component of modern      medical practice, yet traditional educational methods are impractical for many      Primary Care Physicians. Web-based programs may fulfill the requirements of busy       practitioners who have difficulty attending formal education sessions. METHODS:      We piloted the use of a learning management system to deliver asthma education      materials to Primary Care Physicians in both Australia and Italy in their native       languages. Each group of Physicians accessed an education module which contained       content pages, self-tests, a quiz and a survey. Details of how the Physicians      used the system, their preferences and performance on the assessment were      monitored. RESULTS: The learning management system was well received by both      Italian and Australian Physicians. Thirty-eight (18 Australian, 20 Italian)      Physicians used the system. Participants visited an average of 8.8 pages, with a       mean time per hit of 2.9 min. Formative assessment was undertaken by 63.2% and      summative assessment by 68.4% of participants. There were no substantial      differences in performance between Physicians from both countries. Italian      physicians tended to use the system after hours whereas Australian Physicians      appear to do so between patient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Simple web-based systems are      suitable for delivering educational materials to Primary Care Physicians in a      manner likely to be used.

PMID- 16298545   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to give an overview about the state of      the art in research on home telehealth in an international perspective. METHOD:      The study is based on a review of the scientific literature published between      1990 and 2003 and retrieved via Medline in January/February 2004. All together,      the abstracts of 578 publications have been analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of      publications (44%) comes from the United States, followed by UK and Japan. Most      publications deal with vital sign parameter (VSP) measurement and audio/video      consultations ("virtual visits"). Publications about IT tools for improved      information access and communication as well as decision support for staff,      patients and relatives are relatively sparse. Clinical application domains are      mainly chronic diseases, the elderly population and paediatrics. CONCLUSIONS:      Internationally, we observe a trend towards tools and services not only for     professionals but also for patients and citizens. However, their impact on the      patient-provider relationship and their design for special user groups, such as      elderly and/or disabled needs to be further explored. In general, evaluation      studies are rare and further research is critical to determine the impacts and      benefits, and limitations, of potential solutions and to overcome a number of      hinders and restrictions, such as - the lack of standards to combine incompatible      information systems; - the lack of an evaluation framework considering legal,      ethical, organisational, clinical, usability and technical aspects; - the lack of      proper guidelines for practical implementation of home telehealth solutions.

PMID- 16288899   - Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEEC) undertook considerable efforts to      include themselves in the main research and development activities in the area of      health telematics in Europe. Countries of this region demonstrate diversified      environments of economy transformation and health care systems status. The      transition phase to market economy brings essential risks to the healthcare      system performance. It seems that efforts of developing e-health environment in      CEEC could be substantially accelerated by extended co-operation with partners      from current member states of the European Union. The PRO-ACCESS project was      initiated in the late phase of fifth Framework Programme as supporting action. It      focused on the transfer of current concepts in medical telematics to countries      remaining in the pre-accession phase. The process of dissemination of up-to-date       approaches to e-health environment development is carried out by the Krakow      Centre of Telemedicine and is supported by leading health telematics centres in      Europe. To accelerate the dissemination activities the network of co-operating      centres in CEEC was established. The strategy employed within the PRO-ACCESS      project is supposed to yield "critical mass" necessary for facilitating the      e-health development in this region of Europe. The activities employed to reach      this objective included publishing activities, events and trainings as well as      intake of solutions from supporting centres.

PMID- 16275159   - The paper is presenting the recent evolution of e-health aspects in Romania. Data      presented are based on governmental reports. Surveys organized by the "Lucian      Blaga" University of Sibiu and studies carried on by the national Institute for     Research and Development in Informatics (I.C.I.) have shown that Romania has      important health problems, from cardio vascular diseases (CVD) to cancer and      infectious diseases, a high score on mortality and morbidity and a low one on      natality. Poor management of the health sector did not help to solve all these      problems. In the last 14 years there were several attempts to reform healthcare      but none succeeded until now. The health insurance system is operational but      needs still to be improved. Acknowledging the deep crisis of the health system      the Prime Minister nominated a new minister of health and important changes in      the health management approach are to be envisaged. One of this is the      introduction of the e-procurement system for all health related goods. In spite      of the crisis of the health system, e-health applications are flourishing. We can      distinguish applications at national and local level and also punctual      applications. The main applications refer to hospital information systems (HIS),       electronic health records (EHR), e-procurement, image processing, diagnosis and      treatment aids, telediagnosis, teleconsultation, education, research and domain      oriented web support services. Most academic clinical hospital is now members of       a web community "mednet". Unfortunately a lot of medical web sites have      disappeared for lack of funds. As the health sector is in general funded from the      public budget and the health crisis is deepened in the last years, the driving      force in implementing e-health concepts and technologies is not the Ministry of      Health but the Information Technology (IT) community, with a strong support from       the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications and also from the      Ministry of Education and Research, the Romanian Academy and professional      non-governmental organizations. Our government has established the strategy for     achieving the e-society for almost all domains but healthcare is still the      Cinderella. It is expected that IT will play the role of the Fair Godmother by      improving the general health status of the population through a better management      of health services and better access to information and knowledge, for both major     actors: the health professionals and the citizens.

PMID- 16263327   - BACKGROUND: At the University Hospital Giessen, an anesthesia information      management system (AIMS) is used for online record keeping of perioperative      patient care, but preoperative anaesthesia assessments were still being recorded       on paper and subsequently entered into the AIMS. Personal digital assistants      (PDAs) seem to be useful instruments to establish a seamless digital      anesthesiological documentation. OBJECTIVES: We decided to implement a solution      for direct integration of data gathered during the preoperative assessment into      the existing data management infrastructure. Parallel to the development of the      system, we surveyed the future users to match their wishes and needs as far as      possible. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: A C program embedding the preoperative AIMS' data      fields was developed. Data alignment with the Hospital information system (HIS)      is controlled by a Java desktop software. The anaesthesiologist completes the      available fields at the patient's bedside following the same algorithm and      integrity check as the PC version. STATUS REPORT: Overall, 68% of the surveyed      physicians supported the implementation of the system. The PDA solution has been       available since May 2002. Data replication into the handheld and integration of      mobile collected data into the AIMS generally work without problems. The HIS      interconnection software converts the PDA file into the AIMS format for further     processing. DISCUSSION: The preoperative anaesthetic assessment is a standardised      task well suitable for conversion to an electronic data storage medium. Changing       from redundant data entry in the OR to direct electronic recording at the      patient's bedside seems simply logical. Handheld computers are inexpensive,      flexible gadgets to realize this.

PMID- 16253546   - An important research task of the EuroMISE Centre is the applied research in the       field of electronic health record (EHR) design including electronic medical      guidelines and intelligent systems for data mining and decision support. The      research in this field was inspired by several European projects. We have      proposed a mathematical meta-description of a flexible information storage model       based on the experience gathered in cooperation in those projects. In this model,      we use two basic structures called a knowledge base and data files. We describe      those two structures using the graph theory concepts. Furthermore, we use logical      formulas to express conditions that should be valid. Additionally, we present a      description of a global system architecture of a 3-tier EHR application with      interfaces based on the latest technologies; predominately on Web Services, SOAP,      XML, HTTP, CORBA, etc. According to our experience and test results gained from      the MUDR EHR usage, we describe an open universal solution, which can be applied       as the EHR kernel of hospital information systems. To realize this approach in a       daily practice for health professionals we have started a co-operative project      with clinical information systems developers. Within that project we are      developing a new system for continual shared health care.

PMID- 16219485   - INTRODUCTION: Problem lists summarize an aspect of the patient's medical history       and provide an important way to implement entry points for clinical pathways and       guideline-oriented care. However, in order to automate processes based on problem      lists, the use of controlled vocabularies is required. We developed a methodology      to extract a collection of standardized problem-related terms from medical      documents entered in free text by physicians. METHODS: We extracted a corpus of      sentences describing problems from a randomized selection of admission notes      collected at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Theses sentences underwent      manual and automatic normalization processes, and a statistical clustering, in      order to build a set of terms. RESULTS: We obtained 17,805 sentences from 5000      admission notes. We refined them into 1546 terms, 88.6% of which could be related      to a relevant problem statement. DISCUSSION: A clinically relevant problems      terminology was derived from clinical admission notes in free-text using a few      methodical steps with a reasonable investment of human resources. Such an      approach will ease the development and the use of problem lists better suited to       user needs.

PMID- 16213783   - OBJECTIVES: Patients with diabetes need to be aware of essential information to      be involved in decision-making, manage diabetes properly, and communicate with      doctors and other healthcare providers effectively. We have developed Violet      Technology (VT) to provide features beyond previous health information tailoring       systems by dynamically prioritizing diabetes learning topics and providing      integrated direct support for patient-provider communication through formulation       of individualized agendas to take to healthcare encounters. METHODS: A particular     feature of the VT approach is a Diabetes Information Profile (DIP) that models      psychosocial and educational exposure features, as well as clinical      characteristics, and considers expressed patient information preferences and      recent information browsing history. The agenda facility recommends questions      that the patients may have based on their profile, as well as helping to      initialize a patient empowerment protocol. The technology uses a modular and      extensible approach for key components, including consumer health information,      prioritization rules, and methods of instantiating the DIP. VT has been      implemented into a web portal for patient use. Two phases of evaluation studies      have been conducted to collect patient and healthcare provider feedback. RESULTS       AND CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that VT prioritizes relevant and important      information for individual patients. Moreover, both patients and providers      indicate that formulating an agenda of questions is important for patients. More       extensive system use is needed to establish if the technology can deliver an      improved patient-provider partnership and, ultimately, improved health outcomes.

PMID- 16213189   - At no time in the history of medicine has the growth in knowledge and      technologies been so profound [Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System      for the 21st Century, Institute of Medicine (IOM), 2001. ISBN 0-309-07280-8].      However, healthcare delivery systems today are not able to keep up with the pace.      Studies have shown that it takes an average of about 17 years for new knowledge      generated by randomized trials to be incorporated into practice [B. Andrew, S.      Boren, Managing clinical knowledge for health care improvement, in: Yearbook of      Medical Informatics, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, 2000, pp.      65-70]. It is safe to say that today healthcare systems "have the data, but not      information". In order to provide highest quality patient care, Republic of      Croatia has started the process of introducing enterprise information systems to       support business processes in the healthcare domain. Two major requirements are      in focus: to provide efficient healthcare related data management in support of      decision-making processes; and to support continuous process of healthcare      resources spending optimization. The first initiated project refers to Primary      Healthcare Information System (PHCIS) that provides domain of primary care with      state-of-the-art enterprise information system that connects General      Practitioners, Pediatricians and Gynecologists offices with the Croatian      Institute for Health Insurance and Public Health Institute. In the years to come,      PHCIS will serve as the main integration platform for connecting all other     stakeholders and levels of healthcare (e.g. hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories)       into single enterprise healthcare network. This article gives an overview of      PHCIS, explains challenges that were faced in designing and implementing the      system, and elaborates PHCIS role as the cornerstone for the next generation      healthcare provisioning in Republic of Croatia.

PMID- 16203172   - OBJECTIVE: Terminologia anatomica is the new standard in anatomical terminology.       This terminology is available only in Latin and English and its worldwide      adoption is subject to the addition of terms from others languages. On the other       hand, Nomina anatomica, the previous standard, has been widely translated. Aim of      this work was to append foreign terms to Terminologia by using      similarity-matching algorithm between its Latin terms and those from Nomina.      METHODS: A semi-automatic matching of Latin terms from Terminologia with those of      Nomina was performed using a string-to-string distance algorithm and manual      assessment. We used a French-Latin version of Nomina together with Terminologia      and we suggested French terms for Terminologia. Coverage was evaluated by the      number of exact and approximate matches. A target of 78% was set due to the      higher number of terms in Terminologia compared to Nomina. Relevance was      estimated by manually comparing the meanings of the English and French terms      related to the same Latin term. The question was whether they refer to the same      anatomical structure. RESULTS: Exact or approximate matches were found for 5982      terms (76.5%) of Terminologia. Our results indicated that more than 75% of the      terms from Terminologia came from Nomina, most of them were left unchanged and      all were used with the same meaning. CONCLUSION: This method produces relevant      results, reaching our 78% target. The method is based only on Latin terms and can      be used for other languages. We consider this work as a starting point for adding      terms to other knowledge sources, such as the foundational model of anatomy or     the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

PMID- 16199198   - OBJECTIVES: For establishing trustworthiness in advanced architectures for     future-proof health information systems being open, flexible, scaleable,      portable, and semantically interoperable, security and privacy services needed      must be designed as an inherent part of the architecture. Such architecture has      to meet the paradigms of distribution, component orientation, formal modelling,      separation of logical and technological aspects, etc. METHODS: In model-driven      architectures components providing security and privacy services have to be      specified using the same methodology of formal models with meta-languages as      expression means, as deployed in computational, technical, or medical domains.      The resulting approach must be based on the ISO Reference Model-Open Distributed       Processing. RESULTS: Currently, standards developing organisation are defining      emerging tasks and standards for semantic interoperability and trustworthy      collaboration for advanced health information systems. Communication security      issues have been specified and implemented, while application security challenges      such as privilege management and access control are still under development.      Therefore, a series of formal models have been developed by the authors covering,      e.g. domains, service delegation, claims control, policies, roles,      authorisations, and access control. The required models are introduced and      interpreted in a generic way. The crucial concept of security policy and its      relationship to the other concepts has been considered in detail. CONCLUSION:      Based on formal models, security services can be integrated into advanced systems      architectures enabling semantic interoperability in the context of      trustworthiness of communication and co-operation.

PMID- 16198618   - Examples are given of the use of large research databases for knowledge      discovery. Such databases are not only increasingly used for research in the      'hard' mathematics-based disciplines such as physics and engineering but also in       more 'soft' disciplines, such as sociology, psychology and, in general, the      humanities. In between the 'hard' and the 'soft' disciplines lie disciplines such      as biomedicine and health care, from which we have selected our illustrations.      This latter area can be subdivided into: (1) fundamental biomedical research,      related to the 'hard' scientific approach; (2) clinical research, using both      'hard' and 'soft' data and (3) population-based research, which can be subdivided      into prospective and retrospective research. The examples that we shall offer are      representative for using computers in scientific research in general, but in      medical and health informatics in particular.

PMID- 16198142   - OBJECTIVES: The current policies of the governments of Australia and New Zealand       encourage the use of electronic information systems to exchange patient      information between various stakeholders. This research investigated (1) the      attitudes of patients toward sharing their medical information and (2) whether     patients considered themselves to be well-informed about the uses that are made      of their information. METHODS: A questionnaire survey of adult primary-care      patients was conducted in five clinics within a medium sized New Zealand city.      Outcome measures were the proportions of respondents willing to share different      categories of their information with different classes of recipients. Patients'      evaluations of their knowledge about the uses made of their information were also      collected. RESULTS: Over 200 responses were collected from five clinics.      Respondents' attitudes toward sharing their information were found to be      influenced by three factors. (1) Identity of recipient: whilst respondents were      generally willing to have their information shared between health professionals,       they were increasingly unwilling for it to be distributed to other stakeholders,       such as administrators, researchers or other government departments. (2) Level of      anonymity: respondents were more prepared to share anonymous information. (3)      Type of information: respondents were increasingly unwilling to share their     information as it takes on a more personal nature. Respondents were also found to      be very poorly informed about the use of their information, 90% of respondents      indicated that they had either incomplete or no knowledge of how their     information was shared and 79% had no knowledge of the uses of their National      Health Index (NHI) number. The findings also indicate that respondents would      prefer to be consulted about the distribution of their information. CONCLUSIONS:       These findings indicate that many respondents were unwilling to have their     personal information distributed other than for purposes of clinical care and a      sizeable proportion of the respondents would like to be consulted before their     information is released. The high level of interest and concern that this      research revealed among respondents, suggests that more attention should be      directed towards ensuring that patients are fully informed about current      information sharing practices. The findings also imply that the design and      development of future systems should also incorporate sophisticated and flexible       access control policies that can be adapted to meet the preferences of individual      patients.

PMID- 16188493   - The European Research Area requires either technological development or     information literacy of health professionals. This information literacy shall be       understood much deeper and broader than a basic preparation to use ICT tools in      everyday life only. The author's first aim is to present the literature review      and analysis of different definition of the "information" concept in Polish and      foreign sources for health sciences, to emphasize a problem fundamental for an      information society development, i.e. lack of adequate "information"      understanding. Health professionals' information literacy shall also build an      awareness of conceptual differences among numerous classifications, thesauruses,       and information-retrieval languages, which result in different information      received in a retrieval process. This problem can be of crucial effect for either     health research or practice. Understanding the problem shall mobilize the      researchers, classifiers, and indexers to co-ordinate efforts aimed in organizing      "a translator" covering the most popular classifications' and thesauruses'      concepts, to make an international research co-operation easier, relevant, and      safe for the patients.

PMID- 16188492   - PURPOSE: To address the problem of properly built health information systems in      general practice as an important issue for their approval and use in clinical      practice. We present how a national general practitioner (GP) network was built,       put in practice and several results of its activity seen from the clinician's and      the software application team's points of view. METHODS: We used a multi-level      incremental development appropriate for the conditions of the required      information system. After the development of the first version of the software      components (based on rapid prototyping) of the sentinel network, a questionnaire       addressed the needs and improvements required by the health professionals. Based       on the answers, the functionality of the system and the interface were improved      regarding the real needs expressed by the end-users. RESULTS: The network is      functional and the collected data from the network are being processed using      statistical methods. The academic software team developed a GP application that      is well received by the GPs in the network, as resulted from the survey and      discussions during the training period. As an added confirmation, several GPs      outside the network enrolled after seeing the software at work. Another     confirmation that we did a good job was that after the final presentation of the       results of the project a representative from the Romanian Society for Cardiology       expressed the wish of this society to access the data yielded by the network.

PMID- 16169772   - Little is known about utilization of different evidence-based order sets within      computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems. We designed a retrospective      study of resident and attending physician order set utilization to evaluate the      use of three evidence-based computerized order sets (asthma, post-appendectomy      care, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)), and examine patient and admission       characteristics associated with order set utilization in pediatrics. We studied      all 529 asthma patients, 277 appendectomy patients, and 210 CAP patients admitted      between 1 November 2001 and 30 November 2003 during implementation of      standardized order sets at a large, independent, not-for-profit pediatric      institution. We analyzed order set utilization for the three order sets and      tested the relationship between order set use and potential factors associated      with utilization. Order set utilization varied by condition (X(2)=339.2,      p<0.001), with the asthma order set use rate highest (88.1%), followed by      appendectomy order set utilization (79.4%), and substantially lower CAP order set      use (21.1%). We found that trends in order set utilization also varied by      condition. Only the asthma order set showed a trend of increasing use after     implementation (z= -3.02, p=0.002). In addition, factors associated with order     set utilization varied. Uses of the asthma and post-appendectomy order sets were       associated with factors such as admission unit and case complexity. CAP order set      utilization was associated with case complexity but not admission source. We      conclude that health services organizations looking to implement computerized      order sets to reduce unnecessary practice variation while promoting best      practices must consider the different factors that may influence the use of each       order set rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all implementation strategy.      Further, issues such as the level of physician involvement in order set      development and consensus around order set content may be particularly important       factors influencing order set utilization.

PMID- 16169771   - In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of      hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous      progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this      progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it      would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging      societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future      development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter     Reichertz' lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two      questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information      systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information      systems in the future? The following lines of development for HIS were considered      as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based processing and      storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; (2) the shift      from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital information systems      towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of patients and health      consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals and administrators; (4)      the use of HIS data not only for patient care and administrative purposes, but      also for health care planning as well as clinical and epidemiological research;      (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical HIS problems to those of change      management as well as of strategic information management; (6) the shift from      mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and now also to data on the molecular       level; (7) the steady increase of new technologies to be included, now starting      to include ubiquitous computing environments and sensor-based technologies for     health monitoring. As consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for     institutional and (inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to      explore new (transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for     education in health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including      appropriate knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for     reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for     research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and      investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system architectures,      of adequate methods for strategic information management, of methods for modeling      and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of comprehensive electronic      patient records, providing appropriate access for health care professionals as      well as for patients, in the broad sense as described here, e.g. including home      care and health monitoring facilities. Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004,      we have to recognize that we imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS       have become one of the most challenging and promising fields of research,      education and practice for medical informatics, with significant benefits to      medicine and health care in general.

PMID- 16169770   - OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive instrument assessing quality of      health-related web sites. METHODS: Phase I consisted of a literature review to      identify constructs thought to indicate web site quality and to identify items.      During content analysis, duplicate items were eliminated and items that were not       clear, meaningful, or measurable were reworded or removed. Some items were      generated by the authors. Phase II: a panel consisting of six healthcare and MIS       reviewers was convened to assess each item for its relevance and importance to      the construct and to assess item clarity and measurement feasibility. RESULTS:      Three hundred and eighty-four items were generated from 26 sources. The initial      content analysis reduced the scale to 104 items. Four of the six expert reviewers      responded; high concordance on the relevance, importance and measurement      feasibility of each item was observed: 3 out of 4, or all raters agreed on 76-85%      of items. Based on the panel ratings, 9 items were removed, 3 added, and 10      revised. The WebMedQual consists of 8 categories, 8 sub-categories, 95 items and       3 supplemental items to assess web site quality. The constructs are: content (19       items), authority of source (18 items), design (19 items), accessibility and      availability (6 items), links (4 items), user support (9 items), confidentiality       and privacy (17 items), e-commerce (6 items). CONCLUSION: The "WebMedQual"      represents a first step toward a comprehensive and standard quality assessment of      health web sites. This scale will allow relatively easy assessment of quality      with possible numeric scoring.

PMID- 16169769   - PURPOSE: This paper presents a project whose main goal is to construct a corpus      of clinical text manually annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. We      describe and discuss the process of training three domain experts to perform      linguistic annotation. METHODS: Three domain experts were trained to perform      manual annotation of a corpus of clinical notes. A part of this corpus was      combined with the Penn Treebank corpus of general purpose English text and      another part was set aside for testing. The corpora were then used for training      and testing statistical part-of-speech taggers. We list some of the challenges as      well as encouraging results pertaining to inter-rater agreement and consistency      of annotation. RESULTS: We used the Trigrams'n'Tags (TnT) [T. Brants, TnT-a      statistical part-of-speech tagger, In: Proceedings of NAACL/ANLP-2000 Symposium,       2000] tagger trained on general English data to achieve 89.79% correctness. The      same tagger trained on a portion of the medical data annotated for this project      improved the performance to 94.69%. Furthermore, we find that discriminating      between different types of discourse represented by different sections of      clinical text may be very beneficial to improve correctness of POS tagging.      CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experimental results indicate the necessity for     adapting state-of-the-art POS taggers to the sublanguage domain of clinical text.

PMID- 16169767   - According to the World Health Organisation, rheumatic diseases are likely to go      on occupying a prominent place worldwide. As to US statistics, rheumatic diseases      are currently the most frequent chronic disorders and leading cause of      disability. The development of functional clinical database or rheumatic diseases      represents an essential condition how to acquire necessary epidemiological and      other information on disorders under study. In 1999-2003, Institute of      Rheumatology in cooperation with EuroMISE have developed clinical      database/national register of selected systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases      inclusive of bank of sera and DNA. Aims of this phase of the pilot research have       been formulated into following relevant and time borders: to gather clinical,      laboratory, genetic but also pharmaco- and socio-economic data in a      representative sample of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic      sclerosis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease;      rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis,      psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis. The data about patients entering the       register are differentiated according to the disease of the patient. However,      many diseases have several data in common. Therefore, a simple common data      structure for examination of all monitored diseases was chosen. In 2002, the      preset number of over 2000 registered patients had been achieved with      collaboration of 34 territorial and 20 institutional rheumatologists in the whole      covering the majority of the Czech Republic. Some first acquired information      inclusive comparison with German database is demonstrated.

PMID- 16165396   - Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are now being developed in many places.      More advanced systems provide also reminder facilities, usually based on if-then       rules. In this paper we propose a method how to build the reminder facility      directly upon the guideline interchange format (GLIF) model of medical      guidelines. The method compares data items on the input of EHR system with      medical guidelines GLIF model and is able to reveal if the input data item, that       represents patient diagnosis or proposed patient treatment, contradicts with      medical guidelines or not. The reminder facility can be part of EHR system itself      or it can be realized by a stand-alone reminder system (SRS). The possible      architecture of stand-alone reminder system is described in this paper and the      advantages of stand-alone solution are discussed. The part of the EHR system      could be also a browser that would present graphical GLIF model in easy to      understand manner on the user screen. This browser can be data driven and focus      attention of user to the relevant part of medical guidelines GLIF model.

PMID- 16165395   - The aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between citations and      the scientific argumentation found abstracts. We design a related article search       task and observe how the argumentation can affect the search results. We      extracted citation lists from a set of 3200 full-text papers originating from a      narrow domain. In parallel, we recovered the corresponding MEDLINE records for     analysis of the argumentative moves. Our argumentative model is founded on four     classes: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS and CONCLUSION. A Bayesian classifier trained       on explicitly structured MEDLINE abstracts generates these argumentative      categories. The categories are used to generate four different argumentative      indexes. A fifth index contains the complete abstract, together with the title      and the list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. To appraise the      relationship of the moves to the citations, the citation lists were used as the      criteria for determining relatedness of articles, establishing a benchmark; it      means that two articles are considered as "related" if they share a significant      set of co-citations. Our results show that the average precision of queries with       the PURPOSE and CONCLUSION features is the highest, while the precision of the      RESULTS and METHODS features was relatively low. A linear weighting combination      of the moves is proposed, which significantly improves retrieval of related      articles.

PMID- 16153887   - The process of revising the Belgian Nursing Minimum Dataset (B-NMDS) started in      2000 and entailed four major phases. The first phase (June-October 2002) involved      the development of a conceptual framework based on a literature review and      secondary data analysis. The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) was      selected as a framework for the revision of the original B-NMDS. The second phase      (November 2002-September 2003) focused on language development for six care      programs evaluated by panels of clinical experts (N=75). These panels identified       the following items as priorities for the revised B-NMDS: hospital financing,      nurse staffing allocation, assessment of the appropriateness of hospitalisation,       and quality management. During this period, we developed a draft instrument with       92 variables using the NIC. This led to an alpha version of a revised B-NMDS. The      third phase (October 2003-December 2004) focused on data collection and      validation of the new tool. The revised B-NMDS (alpha version) was tested in 158       nursing wards in 66 Belgian hospitals from December 2003 until March 2004. This      test generated data for some 95,000 in-patient days. The interrater reliability      of the revised B-NMDS was assessed. The criterion-related validity of the revised      B-NMDS was compared to that of the original B-NMDS. The discriminative power of      the revised B-NMDS was also assessed to select the most relevant variables for     data collection. This resulted in a beta version of the revised B-NMDS in      December 2004. The records of the revised B-NMDS were linked to the Hospital      Discharge Dataset and other mandatory datasets to integrate the revised B-NMDS      into the overall healthcare management system. The fourth phase (January      2005-December 2005) is presently focusing on information management. Nationwide      implementation is foreseen by January 2007.

PMID- 16153886   - A patient oriented hospital information system (ARIANE) was inaugurated at the      Sherbrooke University hospital (CHUS) in 1990 and a clinical data warehouse (CDW)      completed 2004. The CDW is updated from ARIANE every 24h and includes ICD      discharge diagnosis data, visit DRG and SNOMED encoding. The data is encrypted on      storage. Data is accessed according to institutional approval. To facilitate data      access two levels of tool have been made accessible using a web-browser. The      first level consists of a 'dashboard' that has a defined design and enables a set      of pre-determined dynamic queries about a patient population. This level can be      operated with minimal training. The second level uses a convivial database query       tool, which requires some prior training. Two prototype dashboards have been      designed and evaluated for acceptability. The first for the emergency department       enables analysis of patient occupancy. The second for the biochemistry department      enables quality assurance evaluation. In most cases worldwide the clinical data      warehouse is only beginning to be exploited, often impeded by lack of connection       between different enterprise databases. Our CDW is expected rapidly to create a      culture change so that clinical practice can be continuously evaluated using      compiled data readily available from the electronic health record/hospital      information system.

PMID- 16153885   - The central hypothesis underlying this communication is that the methodology and       conceptual rigor of a philosophically inspired formal ontology can bring      significant benefits in the development and maintenance of application ontologies      [A. Flett, M. Dos Santos, W. Ceusters, Some Ontology Engineering Procedures and      their Supporting Technologies, EKAW2002, 2003]. This hypothesis has been tested      in the collaboration between Language and Computing (L&C), a company specializing      in software for supporting natural language processing especially in the medical       field, and the Institute for Formal Ontology and Medical Information Science      (IFOMIS), an academic research institution concerned with the theoretical      foundations of ontology. In the course of this collaboration L&C's ontology,      LinKBase, which is designed to integrate and support reasoning across a plurality      of external databases, has been subjected to a thorough auditing on the basis of       the principles underlying IFOMIS's Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) [B. Smith, Basic      Formal Ontology, 2002. http://ontology.buffalo.edu/bfo]. The goal is to transform      a large terminology-based ontology into one with the ability to support reasoning      applications. Our general procedure has been the implementation of a      meta-ontological definition space in which the definitions of all the concepts      and relations in LinKBase are standardized in the framework of first-order logic.      In this paper we describe how this principles-based standardization has led to a       greater degree of internal coherence of the LinKBase structure, and how it has      facilitated the construction of mappings between external databases using      LinKBase as translation hub. We argue that the collaboration here described      represents a new phase in the quest to solve the so-called "Tower of Babel"      problem of ontology integration [F. Montayne, J. Flanagan, Formal Ontology: The      Foundation for Natural Language Processing, 2003. http://www.landcglobal.com/].

PMID- 16143564   - The aim of this study was to identify criteria used for evaluation of      teleconsulatation systems in evaluation studies, and to estimate trend of their     changes. Evaluation of teleconsultation (TC) systems was made on the basis of 82       evaluation studies from the inventory of evaluation studies in medical      informatics consisting of all the information and communication technology (ICT)       evaluation studies published in 1982-2002. In order to estimate trend of changes       in using evaluation criteria, the whole period with at least one evaluation      study, it means the period of 1995-2002 was divided to 2 of 4 years, 1995-1998      and 1999-2002. Proportions of evaluation studies according to any single      criterion were calculated. Index of changes I(ci) for ith criterion was defined      as difference of proportion of studies evaluating teleconsultation by using a      certain criterion in the second period and the same proportion in the first      period divided by the number of all studies evaluating teleconsultation systems.       This research showed that hardware and technical aspects were the leading      evaluation criterion, but it has been decreasing (from 74.2% in the first period       to 43.1% in the second one). Satisfactions of both health care provider and      patient achieved the highest increase in the second period (from 3.2 to 19.6% and      from 0 to 15.7%, respectively). Appropriateness and cost of patient care were on       the second place (from 22.6 to 33.3% and from 16.1 to 23.5%, respectively).      Considering defined index of changes it can be concluded that there are four     criteria for evaluation of teleconsultation systems, having a positive trend (in       frequency of evaluation studies): user satisfaction (Ic=0.20), satisfaction of      patient with patient care (Ic=0.19), appropriateness of patient care (Ic=0.13)      and cost of patient care (Ic=0.09). Hardware and technical aspects shows negative      trend in the number of evaluation studies (Ic=-0.38), as well as cost of IT      (Ic=-0.10).

PMID- 16140573   - PURPOSE: The objective of this work was to assess problem-based learning (PBL) as      a method for teaching information and communication technology in medical      informatics (MI) courses. A study was conducted in the Schools of Medicine of      Rennes and Rouen (France) with third-year medical students. METHODS: The      "PBL-in-MI" sessions included a first tutorial group meeting, then personal work,      followed by a second tutorial group meeting. A problem that simulated practice      and was focused on information technology was discussed. In Rouen, the students      were familiar with PBL, and they enrolled on a voluntary basis, while in Rennes,       the students were first-ever participants in PBL courses, and the program was      mandatory. One hundred and seventy-seven students participated in the PBL-in-MI      sessions and were given a questionnaire in order to evaluate qualitatively the      sessions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The response rate was 92.1%. The overall      opinion of the students was good. 69.8% responded positively to the program. In      Rouen, where the students participated in PBL-in-MI sessions on a voluntary      basis, the students were significantly more enthusiastic about PBL-in-MI.      Moreover, attitudes and opinions of students are plausibly related to differences      in previous PBL skills. The fact that the naive group had two tutors, one trained      and one naive as the students, has been investigated. Teacher naivety was an      explanatory factor for the differences between Rennes and Rouen.

PMID- 16140572   - OBJECTIVE: To compare triage decisions of an automated emergency department      triage system with decisions made by an emergency specialist. METHODS: In a      retrospective setting, data extracted from charts of 90 patients with chief      complaint of non-traumatic abdominal pain were used as input for triage system      and emergency medicine specialist. The final disposition and diagnoses of the      physicians who visited the patient in Emergency Department (ED) as reflected in      the medical records were considered as control. Results were compared by      chi(2)-test and a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: Compared to      emergency medicine specialist, triage system had higher sensitivity (90% versus      64%) and lower specificity (25% versus 48%) for patients who required      hospitalization. The triage system successfully predicted the Admit decisions      made in the ED whereas the emergency medicine specialist decisions could not      predict the ED disposition. Both triage system and emergency medicine specialist       properly disposed 56% of cases, however, the emergency medicine specialist in      this study under-disposed more patients than the triage system considering Admit       disposition (p=0.004) while he appropriately discharged more patients compared to      the triage system (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: The triage system studied here shows      promise as a triage decision support tool to be used for telephone triage and      triage in the emergency departments. This technology may also be useful to the      patients as a self-triage tool. However, the efficiency of this particular     application of this technology is unclear.

PMID- 16140571   - The objective of this research work is to simplify and improve the efficiency of       cursor control and its interactions on the computer screen by applying fuzzy      logic in its decision-making to make Internet users with disabilities use the      networked computers conveniently and easily. "Point and click" interactions are      one of the key features of operating systems based of graphical user interfaces      (GUIs) [C.E. Steriadis, P. Constantinou, Designing human-computer interfaces for       quadriplegic people, ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.-Interact. (TOCHI) 10 (2) (2003)      87-118.]. People with severe motor-impairments due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or     spinal cord dysfunction (SCD), however, often have difficulty with accurate and      efficient control of pointing devices, limiting their integration to society and       unassisted control over their environment through the use of such operating      systems [S. Keates, F. Hwang, P. Langdon, P.J. Clarkson, P. Robinson, Cursor     measures for motion-impaired computer users, in: Proceedings of ACM SIGCAPH      Conference of Assistive Technologies - ASSETS 2002, pp. 135-142.]. The questions       "How can someone with severe motor-impairments perform 'point and click'      interactions as accurately and efficiently as an able-bodied person?" and "How      can these interactions be advanced through use of Computational Intelligence      (CI)?" are the driving forces behind the research described in this paper.      Through this research, a novel fuzzy mouse cursor control system (FMCCS) is      described. The FMCCS core consists of several fuzzy control functions, which      define different user interactions with the system. Design and descriptions of      these functions, as well first prototype implementation and testing with real      users sustaining severe disabilities are presented.

PMID- 16139564   - We survey a set a recent advances in natural language processing applied to      biomedical applications, which were presented in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2004 at       an international workshop. While text mining applied to molecular biology and      biomedical literature can report several interesting achievements, we observe      that studies applied to clinical contents are still rare. In general, we argue      that clinical corpora, including electronic patient records, must be made      available to fill the gap between bioinformatics and medical informatics.

PMID- 16137921   - INTRODUCTION: In the discussion about helping lay end users find reliable      health-related information on the web, lay assessment practices of the      reliability of information are often dismissed as insufficient. It is suggested      that patients do not check important background information (authors, dates) for       the medical content on websites. However, little effort has been made to      understand how lay practices enable patients to assess information reliability in      respect to their specific health situations. OBJECTIVE: This paper draws upon      ethnographic research among Dutch patients to understand lay assessment      practices. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews and observed patient      search practices. Patients were asked to describe and then repeat the last      searches they had conducted. They were also given standardized questions for     searching for information. RESULTS: Patients did not utilize special user tools      (checklists, seals, portals) to assist in searching for and evaluating      information. However, we saw explicit strategies for checking information within       their established patterns of searching, such as on and offline triangulation of       information and checking information provider information and dates. CONCLUSION:       Although patients do not follow standardized checklists, this is not to say that       they are not assessing information. Their assessment processes are more extensive      than current literature suggests.

PMID- 16137920   - The continuous increase in the complexity and the heterogeneity of corporate and       healthcare telecommunications infrastructures will require new assessment methods      of quality of service (QoS) provision that are capable of addressing all      engineering and social issues with much faster speeds. Speed and accessibility to      any information at any time from anywhere will create global communications      infrastructures with great performance bottlenecks that may put in danger human      lives, power supplies, national economy and security. Regardless of the      technology supporting the information flows, the final verdict on the QoS is made      by the end user. The users' perception of telecommunications' network      infrastructure QoS provision is critical to the successful business management      operation of any organization. As a result, it is essential to assess the QoS      Provision in the light of user's perception. This article presents a cost      effective methodology to assess the user's perception of quality of service      provision utilizing the existing Staffordshire University Network (SUN) by adding      a component of measurement to the existing model presented by Walker. This paper       presents the real examples of CISCO Networking Solutions for Health Care givers      and offers a cost effective approach to assess the QoS provision within the      campus network, which could be easily adapted to any health care organization or       campus network in the world.

PMID- 16129660   - BACKGROUND: Community-based multiple screening for common cancers and chronic      diseases has increasingly gained attention. However, as infrastructure and      evaluation system are more diversified and complicated compared with single      screening, the development of a novel health information system is paramount.      METHODS: The main goal of our health information system was to support the      multiple screening program not only from technical aspect but also from a broad      range of perspectives including quality assurance system, organized features      appertaining to screening, economic evaluation (cost-effectiveness or     cost-utility analysis), epidemiological applications, behavior risk factor     surveillance system, and social impact due to the introduction of the Keelung      Community-Based Integrated Screening (KCIS) program. RESULTS: Health information       system was designed and programmed on the basis of the demand derived from KCIS      within which five cancers and three chronic diseases were included. In addition      to the detailed description of infrastructure and process, design, relevant      database and security involved in health information system, an innovative and      extensive evaluation system in accordance with the main goals was included in our     health information system. CONCLUSION: Our information system proposed several      aspects regarding organized screening system that has never been addressed in      computerized system supporting for single screening. These included quality      assurance system, organization features, co-morbidity profiles, epidemiological      applications and social and economic considerations.

PMID- 16129659   - Health-related websites have the potential to powerfully influence the attitudes       and behavior of consumers. Access to reliable disease information online has been      linked to reduced anxiety, increased feelings of self-efficacy, and decreases in       utilization of ambulatory care. Studies report that Internet health information      seekers are more likely to have health concerns; adult seekers are more likely to      rate themselves as having poor health status and adolescent seekers are more      likely to demonstrate clinical impairment or depressive symptomatology compared      to non-seekers. Although more and more Americans are using the Internet for     healthcare information, little is known about how this information affects their       health behaviors. The current study extends the literature by examining      characteristics associated with help seeking, either from a healthcare provider     or from peers, as a direct result of health information found online. Medical      care seekers appear to be using the Internet to enhance their medical care; they       report using the information online to diagnose a problem and feel more      comfortable about their health provider's advice given the information found on      the Internet. Support seekers tend to be of slightly lower income compared to      non-support seekers. They are also significantly more likely to have searched for     information about a loved one's medical or health condition, signaling that many       of these consumers may be caretakers.

PMID- 16125999   - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the paper was to determine appropriate terminology,      criteria, implementation, and develop a theoretical framework by which      credibility in health care web sites can be depicted. Future research directions       for evaluating credibility in health care web sites was also discussed. METHOD: A      comprehensive literature review of published articles, policy papers, and grey      literature using relevant search terms was conducted. Sources for articles      reviewed included MEDLINE (from 1966 to present), PsycINFO (from 1840 to      present), ERIC (from 1966 to present), and the Association for Computing      Machinery (ACM) databases. The Web of Science citation service was continuously      searched using a subscription service from 2002 to 2004. The search engine Google      was also implemented. RESULTS: A common term, credibility, was purposed for use      in this context. A comprehensive set of credibility criteria, presented within a       theoretical framework was also developed. Implementation by means of a      browser-based graphic icon was purposed. CONCLUSIONS: Relevancy and readiness of       the purposed common terminology, criteria, and implementation within the      theoretical framework must be further researched. More knowledge of consumers'      behaviour regarding use of online health content and collaboration with others      when implementing such information should be considered in future research.

PMID- 16125455   - OBJECTIVE: As healthcare practice transitions from paper-based to computer-based       records, there is increasing need to determine an effective electronic format for     clinical narratives. Our research focuses on utilizing a cognitive science      methodology to guide the conversion of medical texts to a more structured,      user-customized presentation in the electronic medical record (EMR). DESIGN: We      studied the use of discharge summaries by psychiatrists with varying      expertise-experts, intermediates, and novices. Experts were given two      hypothetical emergency care scenarios with narrative discharge summaries and      asked to verbalize their clinical assessment. Based on the results, the      narratives were presented in a more structured form. Intermediate and novice      subjects received a narrative and a structured discharge summary, and were asked       to verbalize their assessments of each. MEASUREMENTS: A qualitative comparison of      the interview transcripts of all subjects was done by analysis of recall and      inference made with respect to level of expertise. RESULTS: For intermediate and       novice subjects, recall was greater with the structured form than with the      narrative. Novices were also able to make more inferences (not always accurate)      from the structured form than with the narrative. Errors occurred in assessments       using the narrative form but not the structured form. CONCLUSIONS: Our cognitive       methods to study discharge summary use enabled us to extract a conceptual      representation of clinical narratives from end-users. This method allowed us to      identify clinically relevant information that can be used to structure medical      text for the EMR and potentially improve recall and reduce errors.

PMID- 16125454   - Effective and appropriate use of information and communication technologies is an      essential competency for all health care professionals. The purpose of this paper     is to describe the effect of an evolving informatics for evidence-based practice       (IEBP) curriculum on nursing informatics competencies in three student cohorts in      the combined BS/MS program for non-nurses at the Columbia University School of      Nursing. A repeated-measures, non-equivalent comparison group design was used to       determine differences in self-rated informatics competencies pre- and post-IEBP      and between cohorts at the end of the BS year of the combined BS/MS program. The       types of Computer Skill competencies on which the students rated themselves as      competent (> or =3) on admission were generic in nature and reflective of basic      computer literacy. Informatics competencies increased significantly from      admission to BS graduation in all areas for the class of 2002 and in all, but      three areas, for the class of 2003. None of the three cohorts achieved competence      in Computer Skills: Education despite curricular revisions. There were no      significant differences between classes at the end of the BS year. Innovative      educational approaches, such as the one described in this paper demonstrate      promise as a method to achieve informatics competence. It is essential to      integrate routine measurement of informatics competency into the curriculum so      that approaches can be refined as needed to ensure informatics competent      graduates.

PMID- 16125453   - This paper provides results from seven major nationally representative datasets      (two in detail) from the Pew Internet and American Life Project to answer two      primary questions: (1) what influences people to seek online health information      and (2) what influences their perceived outcomes from having access to this      information? Cross-tabulations, logistic regressions, and multidimensional      scaling are applied to these survey datasets. The strongest and most consistent      influences on ever, or more frequently, using the Internet to search for health      information were sex (female), employment (not fulltime), engaging in more other       Internet activities, more specific health reasons (diagnosed with new health      problem, ongoing medical condition, prescribed new medication or treatment), and       helping another deal with health issues. Internet health seeking is consistently       similar to general Internet activities such as email, news, weather, and      sometimes hobbies. A variety of outcomes from or positive assessments of      searching for Internet health information are predicted most strongly by sex      (female), engaging in other Internet activities, Internet health information      seeking including more frequent health seeking, more specific health reasons,      belonging to an online support group sharing health interests, and helping      another deal with an illness or major health condition.

PMID- 16125452   - PURPOSE: To investigate the impacts of the first phase of Taiwan's Bureau of      National Health Insurance (TBNHI) smart card project on existing hospital      information systems. SETTING: TBNHI has launched a nationwide project for     replacement of its paper-based health insurance cards by smart cards (or NHI-IC      cards) since November 1999. The NHI-IC cards have been used since 1 July 2003,      and they have fully replaced the paper-based cards since 1 January 2004.      Hospitals must support the cards in order to provide medical services for insured      patients. METHODS: We made a comprehensive study of the current phase of the      NHI-IC card system, and conducted a questionnaire survey (from 1 October to 30      November, 2003) to investigate the impacts of NHI-IC cards on the existing      hospital information systems. A questionnaire was distributed by mail to 479      hospitals, including 23 medical centers, 71 regional hospitals, and 355 district       hospitals. The returned questionnaires were also collected by prepaid mail.      RESULTS: The questionnaire return rates of the medical centers, regional      hospitals and district hospitals were 39.1, 29.6 and 20.9%, respectively. In      phase 1 of the project, the average number of card readers purchased per medical       center, regional hospital, and district hospital were 202, 45 and 10,      respectively. The average person-days for the enhancement of existing information      systems of a medical center, regional hospital and district hospital were 175, 74      and 58, respectively. Three months after using the NHI-IC cards most hospitals      (60.6%) experienced prolonged service time for their patients due to more      interruptions caused mainly by: (1) impairment of the NHI-IC cards (31.2%), (2)      failure in authentication of the SAMs (17.0%), (3) malfunction in card readers      (15.3%) and (4) problems with interfaces between the card readers and hospital      information systems (15.8%). The overall hospital satisfaction on the 5-point      Likert scale was 2.86. Although most hospitals were OK with the project, there      was about 22% dissatisfied and strongly dissatisfied, that is twice as many      hospitals with satisfied (about 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendations for those       who are planning to implement similar projects are: (1) provide public-awareness       programs or campaigns across the country for elucidating the smart card policy      and educate the public on the proper usage and storage of the cards, (2) improve       the quality of the NHI-IC cards, (3) conduct comprehensive tests in software and       hardware components associated with NHI-IC cards before operating the systems and      (4) perform further investigations in authentication approaches and develop tools      that can quickly identify where and what the problems are.

PMID- 16125450   - OBJECTIVE: To present a smoking cessation website and a reflection on the use of       the Internet as a smoking cessation tool. METHODS: A literature review and an      Internet survey in 1506 current and former smokers. RESULTS: The Internet may be       the only form of smoking cessation support available to many smokers. There is a       competition between hundreds of smoking cessation websites, many of which have a       similar content. Smoking cessation websites are popular, but little scientific      evidence is available on their efficacy. Neither do we know which components of      these websites are most effective in motivating and helping smokers quit smoking       and avoid relapse. Groups of current and former smokers form spontaneously in      discussion forums on the Internet, this is a new feature in the field of      addiction treatment. These discussion forums have not yet been the object of much      scientific research. CONCLUSION: Research should be conducted to assess the      efficacy of smoking cessation website, to identify which of their components are       most effective, and to identify subgroups of current and former smokers for whom       websites are most effective.

PMID- 16125448   - The aim of this study was to identify the underlying semantics of health      consumers' questions and physicians' answers in order to analyze the semantic      patterns within these texts. We manually identified semantic relationships within      question-answer pairs from Ask-the-Doctor Web sites. Identification of the      semantic relationship instances within the texts was based on the relationship      classes and structure of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Semantic      Network. We calculated the frequency of occurrence of each semantic relationship       class, and conceptual graphs were generated, joining concepts together through      the semantic relationships identified. We then analyzed whether representations      of physician's answers exactly matched the form of the question representations.       Lastly, we examined characteristics of the answer conceptual graphs. We      identified 97 semantic relationship instances in the questions and 334 instances       in the answers. The most frequently identified semantic relationship in both      questions and answers was brings_about (causal). We found that the semantic      relationship propositions identified in answers that most frequently contain a      concept also expressed in the question were: brings_about, isa, co_occurs_with,      diagnoses, and treats. Using extracted semantic relationships from real-life      questions and answers can produce a valuable analysis of the characteristics of      these texts. This can lead to clues for creating semantic-based retrieval      techniques that guide users to further information. For example, we determined      that both consumers and physicians often express causative relationships and      these play a key role in leading to further related concepts.

PMID- 16122973   - BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and      Health (ICF), a classification system published in 2001 by the World Health      Organization (WHO), provides a common language and framework for describing      functional status information (FSI) in health records. METHODS: Informed by      ongoing research in coding FSI in patient records, this paper qualitatively      assesses the ICF framework with respect to the desiderata for controlled medical       vocabularies, an enumerated a list of desirable qualities for controlled medical       vocabularies proposed by Cimino [J.J. Cimino, Desiderata for controlled medical      vocabularies in the twenty-first century, Meth. Inform. Med. 37 (1998) 394-403].       RESULTS: The ICF satisfies 5 of the 12 desiderata. Five points were not satisfied      and two points could not be evaluated. CONCLUSION: The ICF is a rich source of      relevant terms, concepts, and relationships, but it was not developed in      consideration of requirements for formal terminologies. Therefore, it could serve      as a base from which to develop a formal terminology of functioning and      disability. This assessment is a key next step in the development of the ICF as a      sensitive, universal measure of functional status.

PMID- 16115795   - Various forms of electronic health records (EHRs) are currently being introduced       in several countries. Nurses are primary stakeholders and need to ensure that      their information and knowledge needs are being met by such systems information      sharing between health care providers to enable them to improve the quality and      efficiency of health care service delivery for all subjects of care. The latest      international EHR standards have adopted the openEHR approach of two-level      modelling. The first level is a stable information model determining structure,      while the second level consists of constraint models or 'archetypes' that reflect      the specifications or clinician rules for how clinical information needs to be      represented to enable unambiguous data sharing. The current state of play in      terms of international health informatics standards development activities is      providing the nursing profession with a unique opportunity and challenge. Much      work has been undertaken internationally in the area of nursing terminologies and      evidence-based practice. This paper argues that to make the most of these      emerging technologies and EHRs we must now concentrate on developing a process to      identify, document, implement, manage and govern our nursing domain knowledge as       well as contribute to the development of relevant international standards. It is       argued that one comprehensive nursing terminology, such as the ICNP or SNOMED CT       is simply too complex and too difficult to maintain. As the openEHR archetype      approach does not rely heavily on big standardised terminologies, it offers more       flexibility during standardisation of clinical concepts and it ensures open,      future-proof electronic health records. We conclude that it is highly desirable      for the nursing profession to adopt this openEHR approach as a means of      documenting and governing the nursing profession's domain knowledge. It is      essential for the nursing profession to develop its domain knowledge constraint      models (archetypes) collaboratively in an international context.

PMID- 16115794   - Ubiquitous information is currently one of the most challenging slogans in      medical informatics research. An adequate architecture for shared electronic      patient records is needed which can use data for multiple purposes and which is      extensible for new research questions. We introduce eardap as architecture for     using routine data for nationwide clinical research in a multihospital      environment. eardap can be characterized as terminology-based. Main advantage of       our approach is the extensibility by new items and new research questions. Once      the definition of items for a research question is finished, a consistent,      corresponding database can be created without any informatics skills. Our     experiences in pediatric oncology in Germany have shown the applicability of      eardap. The functions of our core system were in routine clinical use in several       hospitals. We validated the terminology management system (TMS) and the module      generation tool with the basic data set of pediatric oncology. The multiple      usability depends mainly on the quality of item planning in the TMS. High quality      harmonization will lead to a higher amount of multiply used data. When using      eardap, special emphasis is to be placed on interfaces to local hospital      information systems and data security issues.

PMID- 16115793   - OBJECTIVE: This article presents initial results from a European multi-centre      study to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of an online self-help      treatment support program for Bulimia Nervosa (BN). METHOD: The online program is      based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and consists of seven steps that      patients work through progressively. An overall sample of 141 women suffering      from BN used the program over a 6-month period. Patients were supported by three       face-to-face evaluation interviews with a therapist, and a weekly e-mail contact.      Data on general psychopathology and specific eating disorder symptoms were also      collected at the evaluation interviews. RESULTS: Initial results from the Swiss      sample (N=41) showed significant improvement of overall psychological health      (p<.001) as measured by the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R), and for all dimensions      of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2). CONCLUSION: An online Self-Help program      for BN can be used effectively to reduce eating disorder symptoms in Bulimic      patients and user feedback showed that this approach contributed to increase      patient involvement and service availability. Additional data from the other     centers will further inform the efficacy and impact of this approach.

PMID- 16112896   - This study analyzed what nurses wrote in narrative nursing notes for     cardiac-surgery patients. The nursing notes of 46 patients were analyzed based on      the nursing process. Eight patterns were extracted according to different      combinations of nursing process components, of which an assessment alone was the       most frequent nursing phrase (45.8%), followed by assessment or     diagnosis-intervention-outcome (25.9%). The content of the nursing notes was also      classified into 15 categories, of which nursing outcomes were recorded more      frequently in nursing care driven mainly by physician's order such as      disease-related symptom management, insomnia care, respiratory care, and pain      control, than in independent nursing care such as education and emotional care. A      survey on the attitudes of nurses toward the nursing record revealed that they do      not document nursing outcomes as much as they think they do. The main reasons for     this discrepancy were insufficient time for recording and lack of knowledge about      why, how, and what to evaluate. Even though there is room for improvement,      nursing notes represent a useful resource for determining nursing contributions      to patient outcomes.

PMID- 16112895   - Many health informatics organizations seem to be slow to take up the advantages      of dynamic, web-based technologies for providing services to, and interaction      with, their members; these are often the very technologies they promote for use      within healthcare environments. This paper aims to introduce some of the many      free/libre/open source (FLOSS) applications that are now available to develop      interactive websites and dynamic online communities as part of the structure of      health informatics organizations, and to show how the Open Source Nursing      Informatics Working Group (OSNI) of the special interest group in nursing      informatics of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA-NI) is      using some of these tools to develop an online community of nurse informaticians       through their website, at . Some background introduction to FLOSS applications is      used for the benefit of those less familiar with such tools, and examples of some      of the FLOSS content management systems (CMS) being used by OSNI are described.      The experiences of the OSNI will facilitate a knowledgeable nursing contribution       to the wider discussions on the applications of FLOSS within health and      healthcare, and provides a model that many other groups could adopt.

PMID- 16112894   - In this paper, we present a biomedical name recognition system, called      PowerBioNE. In order to deal with the special phenomena in the biomedical domain,      various evidential features are proposed and integrated through a mutual      information independence model (MIIM). In addition, a support vector machine      (SVM) plus sigmoid is proposed to resolve the data sparseness problem in the      MIIM. In this way, the data sparseness problem in MIIM-based biomedical name      recognition can be resolved effectively and a biomedical name recognition system       with better performance and better portability can be achieved. Finally, we      present two post-processing modules to deal with the nested entity name and      abbreviation phenomena in the biomedical domain to further improve the      performance. Evaluation shows that our system achieves F-measures of 69.1 and      71.2 on the 23 classes of GENIA V1.1 and V3.0, respectively. In particular, our     system achieves an F-measure of 77.8 on the "protein" class of GENIA V3.0. It      also shows that our system outperforms the best-reported system on GENIA V1.1 and      V3.0.

PMID- 16112893   - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The generalised assumption of health information systems       (HIS) success is questioned by a few commentators in the medical informatics      field. They point to widespread HIS failure. The purpose of this paper was      therefore to develop a better conceptual foundation for, and practical guidance      on, health information systems failure (and success). METHODS: Literature and      case analysis plus pilot testing of developed model. RESULTS: Defining HIS      failure and success is complex, and the current evidence base on HIS success and       failure rates was found to be weak. Nonetheless, the best current estimate is      that HIS failure is an important problem. The paper therefore derives and      explains the "design-reality gap" conceptual model. This is shown to be robust in      explaining multiple cases of HIS success and failure, yet provides a contingency       that encompasses the differences which exist in different HIS contexts. The      design-reality gap model is piloted to demonstrate its value as a tool for risk      assessment and mitigation on HIS projects. It also throws into question      traditional, structured development methodologies, highlighting the importance of      emergent change and improvisation in HIS. CONCLUSIONS: The design-reality gap      model can be used to address the problem of HIS failure, both as a post hoc      evaluative tool and as a pre hoc risk assessment and mitigation tool. It also      validates a set of methods, techniques, roles and competencies needed to support       the dynamic improvisations that are found to underpin cases of HIS success.

PMID- 16112892   - OBJECTIVES: In Austria, the general practitioner (GP) is the first point of      contact for persons with health problems. Depending on the severity of the      person's medical condition, a GP may refer her or him to a secondary care      hospital consultant, who reports findings back to the GP in form of a paper-based      discharge letter. Researchers report that paper-based communication of medical      documents between different health care providers is insufficient in quality,      error prone and too slow in many cases. Our aim was to develop and to realise a      strategy for a stepwise replacement of the paper-based transmission of medical      documents with a distributed, shared medical record. METHODS: In the first step      of a three-steps strategy for development of a consistent, comprehensive and      secure regional health care network, an electronic communication of discharge      letters and diagnostic results between existing information systems of different       health care providers in Tyrol, Austria, has been established: in the form of      cryptographically signed S/MIME e-mail messages and, additionally, via a secure      web portal system. In two further steps, an extension of the system by a      bi-directional communication and by improvements of the web portal system is      planned, leading to a comprehensive electronic patient record for shared care.      RESULTS: After realisation of step 1, in October 2004, about 3500 electronic      discharge letters were sent out from the Innsbruck University Hospital (IUH),      which represents about 8% of the total number of discharge letters of the IUH. In      addition, a lot of feedback was received and legal, organisational, financial and      methodical difficulties were overcome. DISCUSSION: The stepwise approach to      replace paper-based with electronic communication in the first step was helpful,       since knowledge has been gained and cooperations were formed. For the realisation      of a distributed, shared medical record (steps 2 and 3), it will not be      sufficient only to replace paper-based transmission of medical documents with      electronic communication technologies, but in the further steps, organisational      changes will become necessary. As well, legal ambiguities must be resolved before      a distributed medical record for cooperative care, used by several institutions      as well as by patients, could be established.

PMID- 16112891   - OBJECTIVES: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provided as a lifelong patient      record advance towards core applications of distributed and co-operating health      information systems and health networks. For meeting the challenge of scalable,      flexible, portable, secure EHR systems, the underlying EHR architecture must be      based on the component paradigm and model driven, separating platform-independent      and platform-specific models. METHODS: Allowing manageable models, real systems      must be decomposed and simplified. The resulting modelling approach has to follow      the ISO Reference Model - Open Distributing Processing (RM-ODP). The ISO RM-ODP      describes any system component from different perspectives. Platform-independent       perspectives contain the enterprise view (business process, policies, scenarios,       use cases), the information view (classes and associations) and the computational      view (composition and decomposition), whereas platform-specific perspectives      concern the engineering view (physical distribution and realisation) and the      technology view (implementation details from protocols up to education and      training) on system components. Those views have to be established for components      reflecting aspects of all domains involved in healthcare environments including      administrative, legal, medical, technical, etc. Thus, security-related component       models reflecting all view mentioned have to be established for enabling both      application and communication security services as integral part of the system's       architecture. Beside decomposition and simplification of system regarding the      different viewpoint on their components, different levels of systems' granularity      can be defined hiding internals or focusing on properties of basic components to       form a more complex structure. The resulting models describe both structure and      behaviour of component-based systems. RESULTS: The described approach has been      deployed in different projects defining EHR systems and their underlying      architectural principles. In that context, the Australian GEHR project, the      openEHR initiative, the revision of CEN ENV 13606 "Electronic Health Record      communication", all based on Archetypes, but also the HL7 version 3 activities      are discussed in some detail. The latter include the HL7 RIM, the HL7 Development      Framework, the HL7's clinical document architecture (CDA) as well as the set of      models from use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams up to Domain      Information Models (DMIMs) and their building blocks Common Message Element Types      (CMET) Constraining Models to their underlying concepts. CONCLUSION: The      future-proof EHR architecture as open, user-centric, user-friendly, flexible,      scalable, portable core application in health information systems and health      networks has to follow advanced architectural paradigms.

PMID- 16112609   - In the field of biomedicine, an overwhelming amount of experimental data has      become available as a result of the high throughput of research in this domain.      The amount of results reported has now grown beyond the limits of what can be      managed by manual means. This makes it increasingly difficult for the researchers      in this area to keep up with the latest developments. Information extraction (IE)      in the biological domain aims to provide an effective automatic means to      dynamically manage the information contained in archived journal articles and      abstract collections and thus help researchers in their work. However, while      considerable advances have been made in certain areas of IE, pinpointing and      organizing factual information (such as experimental results) remains a      challenge. In this paper we propose tackling this task by incorporating into IE      information about rhetorical zones, i.e. classification of spans of text in terms      of argumentation and intellectual attribution. As the first step towards this      goal, we introduce a scheme for annotating biological texts for rhetorical zones       and provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data annotated      according to this scheme. We also discuss our preliminary research on automatic      zone analysis, and its incorporation into our IE framework.

PMID- 16103007   - BACKGROUND: Existing classifications in Sweden of health care interventions used       for quality assurance issues and for decisions on resource allocation does not      capture all types of health care interventions. The work of professional groups      like nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists is partly invisible.      There is a need to develop a classification of health care interventions that      comprise all activity within the health care sector. AIM: To describe a      multi-professional collaborative work on classification development and to      provide suggestions for an organizing structure that can capture interventions in      the health care services incorporating different professional perspectives.      RESULTS: The professional groups reached a common understanding about the use of       the classification of The International Classification of Functioning, Disability      and Health (ICF) as a unifying framework in the classification of health care      interventions. Proposal was made for a revised structure of a current      classification of interventions using ICD as unifying framework. CONCLUSION: The       use of ICF as a unifying framework is seen as a fruitful way of overcoming      professional differences, and by that supporting the process of reaching a common      understanding and use of a common language when describing interventions in      health care.

PMID- 16099711   - Rigorous evaluation of informatics applications in healthcare is important so      that the impact of such systems can be understood. Although many quantitative      methods have been employed to evaluate informatics systems, there is a growing      trend to utilized qualitative methods during both the formative and summative      phases of research. Several evaluation frameworks that have been proposed      highlight the need for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods in      the development and post-implementation phases of informatics systems      development. Recommendations regarding the timing, type and use of qualitative      methods differ for each of these frameworks. This paper examines the strengths      and weaknesses of the published evaluation frameworks and enumerates the      qualitative research methods in use in each of these frameworks.

PMID- 16099202   - AIM: The new budget system for Dutch hospitals makes use of patient groups that      are highly homogeneous in terms of diagnosis and treatment combinations (diagnose      behandeling combinaties (DBC)). These DBCs are the Dutch DRG variants. The DBC      mainly concerns medical care; nursing care is almost regarded as a constant      factor. In this study the DBC is linked to the nursing minimum data set for The      Netherlands (NMDSN), to explore the degree of homogeneity in terms of nursing      care for patient groups that are homogeneous in terms of the DBC. METHOD: In nine      Dutch hospitals, patient information was collected by means of the NMDSN. To      answer the question, we performed a secondary data analysis on the NMDSN. First,       groups were formed in terms of medical diagnoses as defined in the DBC. Next,      explorative statistical analyses were used to form homogeneous groups in terms of      nursing diagnoses. These groups were compared in terms of the nursing care      interventions and in terms of medical diagnoses. FINDING: Some medical diagnoses       seem to be homogeneous, others more heterogeneous in terms of nursing care.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Limitations in the study design hinder a firm      conclusion. However, the results discourage the use of the medical DBC for     nursing care.

PMID- 16099201   - We present an evaluation of Link Grammar and Connexor Machinese Syntax, two major     broad-coverage dependency parsers, on a custom hand-annotated corpus consisting      of sentences regarding protein-protein interactions. In the evaluation, we apply       the notion of an interaction subgraph, which is the subgraph of a dependency      graph expressing a protein-protein interaction. We measure the performance of the      parsers for recovery of individual dependencies, fully correct parses, and      interaction subgraphs. For Link Grammar, an open system that can be inspected in       detail, we further perform a comprehensive failure analysis, report specific      causes of error, and suggest potential modifications to the grammar. We find that      both parsers perform worse on biomedical English than previously reported on      general English. While Connexor Machinese Syntax significantly outperforms Link      Grammar, the failure analysis suggests specific ways in which the latter could be      modified for better performance in the domain.

PMID- 16099200   - The purpose of this study was to describe the information management used by      hospital and home care nurses for patients in need of continuing care after an      episode of hospitalization. METHOD: A prospective descriptive design was used. In      total 287 hospital nurses and 220 home care nurses were asked to complete a      questionnaire before and after the hospital implemented nursing documentation      integrated in the electronic patient record (EPR). RESULTS: Discrepancies between      the policies expressed by the health care organizations and the authorities in      formal documents and the information management used by the nurses were      identified. Differences were also found between nurses in hospital and home care       with regard to how they assessed the information management during patient      admission, throughout the patient's hospital stay and at the patient's discharge.      The perceived differences decreased, however, after the hospital introduced      electronic nursing documentation. The study shows a need to contextualize and      customize the information that nurses exchange. In addition technological      problems with the lack of integrated EPR systems between the hospital and the      home health care as well as different practice models in the two organizations      entail complex information handling during a patient's trajectory through the      health system.

PMID- 16095963   - BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that medical injuries, or adverse events,      represent an important international problem, and that many are caused by errors.      Spontaneous reporting is the main tool used to detect errors and adverse events      in most countries, and reporting systems are believed to be important for     improving patient safety. Increasingly, such reporting can be done using      information systems, and information systems are widely used in Korea. However,      few data are available regarding the use of electronic medical error reporting      systems in Korea. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate      the present status of reporting system of Korean hospitals, and to compare the      current status of medical error reporting systems with that of other health      information sub systems. METHODS: The chairs of nursing departments of all 283      hospitals nationwide with more than 100 beds were surveyed using a structured      questionnaire. The response rate was 35%. In addition, two reports on the      national use of health information systems in Korea from 1999 and 2003 were      analyzed. RESULTS: Among reporting hospitals (n=99), medical errors were reported      on paper in 75 hospitals (77%), verbally in 30 hospitals (30%), using word      processing in 13 hospitals (13%), and using the hospital information system in      only three hospitals (3%). In contrast, there was widespread and increasing use      of health information technology (HIT) in areas such as medication      administration, inpatient and outpatient order entry, and radiology. CONCLUSIONS:      While HIT is increasingly widely used in Korea in many areas, it is not being      used for error reporting. Increasing the use of electronic reporting systems, and      systemically evaluating the medical errors and adverse events reported, represent      essential steps for reducing systemic errors and improving patient safety.

PMID- 16095962   - PURPOSE: Over recent years, there has been a growing interest in extracting      entities and relations from biomedical literature. There are a vast number of      systems and approaches being proposed to extract biological relations, but none      of them achieves satisfactory results. These methodologies are either     parsing-based or pattern-based, which are not competent to handle the grammatical      complexities of biomedical texts, or too complicated to be adapted. It is well      known that appositive, coordinative propositions and such grammatical structures       are extremely common in biomedical texts, particularly in full texts. However,      these problems are still untouched for most of researchers. METHODS: In this      paper, we have proposed a new approach, which is hybrid with both shallow parsing      and pattern matching, to extract relations between proteins from scientific      papers of biomedical themes. In the method, appositive and coordinative      structures are interpreted based on the shallow parsing analysis, with both      syntactic and semantic constraints. Then long sentences are splitted into      sub-ones, from which relations are extracted by a greedy pattern matching      algorithm, along with automatically generated patterns. RESULTS: Our approach is       experimented to extract protein-protein interactions from full biomedical texts,       and has achieved an average F-score of 80% on individual verbs, and 66% on all      verbs. With the help of shallow parsing analysis, pattern matching is improved      remarkably. Compared with the traditional pattern matching algorithm, our     approach achieves about 7% improvement of both precision and F-score. In contrast      to other systems, our approach achieves performance comparable to the best. A      demo system has been available at http://spies.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn.

PMID- 16095961   - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Electronic patient-provider communication promises to improve      efficiency and effectiveness of clinical care. This study aims to explore whether     a secure web-based messaging system is an effective way of providing patient care      in general practices. METHOD: We conducted a randomised controlled trail and      recruited 200 patients from the waiting area in one primary clinic in Norway.      Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received      access to a secure messaging system, or the control group receiving standard care      without such access. Primary outcome measures were number of online      consultations, telephone consultations and office visits in the two groups. Data       were derived from patient records and collected 1 year prior to (baseline), and 1      year after the intervention. RESULTS: Forty-six percent of the patients who were       given access to the messaging system (n=99) used the online communication system       on at least one occasion (ranging from 1 to 17 messages per patient per year). A       total of 147 electronic messages were sent to six general practitioners during a       1-year trial period. Eleven percent of the messages were to schedule an      appointment. In 10% of the messages, the GP was unable to respond adequately and       recommended an office visit. The reduction in office visits over time was greater     for the intervention group than for the control group (P=0.034). There was      however no significant difference in the number of telephone consultations      between the groups during the study (P=0.258). CONCLUSION: The use of a secure      electronic messaging system reduced the number of office visits at the general      practice, but not phone consultations.

PMID- 16095960   - BACKGROUND: When developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT), such       as services for the decision-making process, skilled health care professionals      with their comprehensive knowledge of patients/clients are essential contributors      to the project. Careful evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of      project management as well as to analyze the commitment of the personnel to goal       attainment. OBJECTIVE: In the course of the development of integrated maternity      care services, the commitment of project participants (n=48) was evaluated. What       factors enhanced or impaired their commitment to the project work? METHODS:      Questionnaire (n=80, response rate 60%) with quantitative analysis as well as      open-ended questions with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Positive      commitment was related to a confidential and open atmosphere during the project.       The utilization of personal skills and experience was appreciated. Differences in      the working principles and cultures between the participating organizations      complicated fluent collaboration. To encourage commitment, a lot of attention      should be paid to internal communication as well as the effective realization of       project tasks. CONCLUSION: The strength of the project was the highly innovative       and confidential atmosphere. The well-established project goals, the highly      inspired project team, and the effective co-operation between the project manager     and the core group helped to deepen overall commitment in the project.

PMID- 16087392   - Recent developments in biomedical informatics research have afforded      possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting      opportunities also present a number of challenges to the implementation and      integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf      between technologic artifacts and end users, which compromises the culture of      safety in the workplace. Because clinical practice is a human endeavor, there is       a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid      technologic advances. This, in turn, necessitates a broadening of disciplinary      boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors related to the design and use      of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science       in understanding nursing factors associated with patient safety. Cognitive      science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human      performance. Studies of clinical cognition can meaningfully inform and shape      design, development and assessment of information systems. Furthermore, they have      a decisive impact on whether information technology has a positive influence on      human performance and are especially important in understanding and promoting      safe practices. These issues are discussed in the context of clinical informatics      with a focus on nursing practice.

PMID- 16085454   - BACKGROUND: Although there are many reasons that widespread adoption of      healthcare information systems has not transpired, one reason is a failure to      take into account the cognitive needs of the users. AIM: To understand the      cognitive needs of nurses and physicians and determine how these needs should      influence the design of healthcare interfaces. DESIGN OF STUDY: A qualitative and      quantitative study that compares how nurses and physicians comprehend patient      information. SETTING: Twenty-four registered nurses and twenty-four physicians      working in the specialties of gastrointestinal or internal medicine. METHODS:      Each clinician reviewed two mock electronic medical records and summarized the      cases using a think-aloud protocol. All verbalizations were coded for medical and      conceptual information. RESULTS: The nurses included a larger mean proportion      (p<0.001) of recalls than did the physicians. As compared to the nurses, the      physicians included a statistically significant (p<0.001) larger mean proportion       of inferences, conditional statements, and interventions. The nurses concentrated      on functional problems, whereas the physicians focused on diagnosis, treatment,      and management. CONCLUSION: The main cognitive differences between the physicians      and the nurses are explained through the differences in their practice models.      Therefore, healthcare IT must develop separate interfaces for each discipline to       address their unique needs.

PMID- 16085453   - Biological databases contain facts from scientific literature that have been      curated by hand to ensure high quality. Curation is time-consuming and can be      supported by information extraction methods. We present a server software      infrastructure which allows to easily plug in modules to identify biologically      interesting pieces of text to be then presented in a web interface to the      curator. There are modules which identify UniProt, UMLS and GO terminology, gene       and protein names, mutations and protein-protein interactions. UniProt, UMLS and       GO concepts are automatically linked to the original source. The module for     mutations is based on syntax patterns and the one for protein-protein      interactions relies on chunk parsing. All modules work as separate servers      possibly distributed on different machines and can be combined into processing      pipelines as necessary. Communication is based on XML annotated text streams,      each server processing the XML elements it is designed for, and possibly adding      more information in the form of XML annotation. The server and the underlying      software are available to the public.

PMID- 16085452   - Health services literature suggests that geographic information systems (GIS) are      useful policy evaluation tools when policy success is dependent on location.      Nursing workforce distribution is an inherently local issue and nursing shortages      present serious concerns for local, state and national governments. In 1991,      Missouri enacted a nurse recruitment and retention policy targeting underserved      (HPSA-designated) counties. Following Institutional Review Board approval, policy      effectiveness was explored using a combination of GIS data visualization, spatial      and classic statistics. Results of both data visualization and statistical      methods do not demonstrate an expected trend of decreasing group differences      between HPSA and non-HPSA-designated counties over time. Only two of the five      time periods studied had significant group differences. Between 1993 and 1995,      the loss in nurse to population ratios in HPSA counties was significant (U=1020,       p<0.001); however, between 1999 and 2001, the growth in nurse to population ratio      changes in HPSA counties was significant (U=1032, p=0.001). The GIS data      visualization and statistical techniques performed suggest that current policy      definitions of underserved areas may not be effective in defining areas of      nursing shortages and the existing policy implementation may not be achieving the      stated goals.

PMID- 16085451   - Health informatics applications are advocated in many setting in many countries,       with convincing logic as to their likely benefits. But at present these visions      are being projected to rapid enforced implementation without the necessary      foundations of: empirical evidence, beta piloting or replication studies,      appreciation of the magnitude of change for health professionals and systems in      electronic working compared to paper-based systems. This is creating legal and      ethical risks that are largely avoidable, all for lack of post-piloting study and      adequate evidence-based preparation. Instead, roll-out should be facilitated by      developing good implementation practice based on empirical evidence from beta      sites, to cover the following aspects: evidence, evaluation, equipment,      education, empowerment. e-Working is an essential technology to support modern      healthcare delivery. It needs to be as evidence-based as any other health care      technology, but at present policy and parsimony are forcing it to fall short of      these standards, thus generating unethical risks.

PMID- 16084757   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare whether students' learning      outcomes would be better in a designed learning environment (WebCT) than in a      conventional web site (WWW) with similar course material but without special      learning tools. CONTEXT: Third-year medical students in an introductory course on      medical informatics at the University of Helsinki, Finland. METHODS: Students      were randomly assigned to a WebCT group (n=39) and a WWW group (n=46). The      students in the WebCT group utilized the course material in general discussion      groups, special discussions about lectures, quizzes and students' own notes. The       WWW group had access only to the course material. The learning outcome was      assessed by administering an on-line examination and the learning experience of      the students was assessed by an on-line quiz. RESULTS: The course grade was      significantly higher in the WebCT group as compared to the WWW group. This      finding was more prominent among females. The students of the WebCT group also      experienced significantly more improvement in collaboration with the use of      computers than the students in the WWW group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results,       web-based learning seems to be more effective when students are provided with      specially designed learning tools.

PMID- 16084124   - The rise of evidence-base practice (EBP) as a standard for care delivery is      rapidly emerging as a global phenomenon that is transcending political, economic       and geographic boundaries. Evidence-based nursing (EBN) addresses the growing      body of nursing knowledge supported by different levels of evidence for best      practices in nursing care. Across all health care, including nursing, we face the      challenge of how to most effectively close the gap between what is known and what      is practiced. There is extensive literature on the barriers and difficulties of      translating research findings into practical application. While the literature      refers to this challenge as the "Bench to Bedside" lag, this paper presents three      collaborative strategies that aim to minimize this gap. The Bedside strategy      proposes to use the data generated from care delivery and captured in the massive      data repositories of electronic health record (EHR) systems as empirical evidence      that can be analysed to discover and then inform best practice. In the Classroom       strategy, we present a description for how evidence-based nursing knowledge is      taught in a baccalaureate nursing program. And finally, the Bench strategy      describes applied informatics in converting paper-based EBN protocols into the      workflow of clinical information systems. Protocols are translated into reference      and executable knowledge with the goal of placing the latest scientific knowledge      at the fingertips of front line clinicians. In all three strategies, information       technology (IT) is presented as the underlying tool that makes this rapid      translation of nursing knowledge into practice and education feasible.

PMID- 16081316   - In the process of developing global health informatics education, a common      understanding of educational outcomes is required. Therefore, an educational      framework for health informatics professionals is desirable to support student      mobility, trans-national and borderless education. Nurses form a significant part      of the health workforce and need to be properly educated for their roles in      health informatics. To ascertain their perceptions of needs and priorities, we      developed a web-based questionnaire and surveyed Australian nurses on the      preferred knowledge/skills set for health informatics professionals. Among      others, the questionnaire is based on the International Medical Informatics      Association's (IMIA) set of recommendations on education and IMIA's scientific      map. Benner's five levels of competencies were applied to measure the degree of      competency required for each skill/knowledge. Altogether, 82 Australian nurses      completed the questionnaire. The nurses' perceived degree of competency required       for a total of 74 specific skills and knowledge in five skill categories is      presented in this paper as well as the overall results for each of the five      categories. Further, significant differences between the nurses' primary roles      and primary interest in health informatics are discussed. The development of a      comprehensive health informatics education framework needs to take into account      nurses as well as other health professionals. Repeating the survey in other     countries and for various professions is essential to develop an international      educational framework.

PMID- 16046276   - An online survey of deans/directors of 266 baccalaureate and higher nursing      programs in the U.S. was developed by informatics expert nurses. Participants (1)      identified nursing informatics (NI) competencies and knowledge of undergraduate      and/or graduate students in their nursing programs; (2) determined faculty      preparedness to teach NI and to use informatics tools; and (3) provided      perceptions of NI requirements of local practicing nurses. Frequency data and      qualitative responses were analyzed. Approximately half of undergraduate nursing       programs were teaching information literacy skills and required students to enter     with word-processing and email skills. Least visible informatics content at all      levels included the use of information system data standards, the Nursing      Information and Data Set Evaluation Center criteria, the unified medical language      system (UMLS), and the nurse's role in the life cycle of an information system.      Almost 50% of respondents perceived faculty as "novice" and "advanced beginners"       in teaching and using NI applications. Participants reported no future plans to      offer NI training in their region. Findings have major implications for nurse      faculty, staff developers, and program administrators who are planning continuing      education opportunities and designing nursing curricula that prepare nurses for     use of the electronic health record and 21st century professional practice.

PMID- 16043392   - OBJECTIVE: To determine use, appreciation and effectiveness of an electronic      health information support system in head and neck (H&N) cancer care. DESIGN: A      prospective evaluation study. The evaluated system has four different functions:       (1) communication amongst health care providers and between health care providers      and patients, (2) information for health care providers and patients, (3) contact      with fellow sufferers and (4) monitoring of discharged patients by means of      electronic questionnaires. Evaluation of the system was done both objectively      using automatically created log files and stored messages, and subjectively by      using paper questionnaires from patients and general practitioners (GPs).      SETTING: Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of a      tertiary health care centre in the Netherlands. The system was put at patients'      disposal for a period of 6 weeks following discharge from the hospital after     surgery for H&N cancer, and was additional to standard care. PARTICIPANTS: Head      and neck cancer patients, hospital physicians, members of a hospital-based      support team, GPs, district nurses and speech therapists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:       Actual use of the system by patients and health care providers. Patients'      appreciation for each of the system's four different functions. GPs' appreciation      for the system. Capability to detect potential patient problems with the system.       RESULTS: The system was used by 36 H&N cancer patients, 10 hospital physicians, 2      members of the support team, 8 GPs, 2 district nurses and 2 speech therapists.      The total number of patient-sessions was 982: an average of 27.3 sessions per     patient during the 6 weeks study period. In total, 456 monitoring questionnaires       were completed. The support team in hospital responded with 231 actions. In 16      cases, an extra appointment was made for a patient with the hospital physician.      Out of these cases, immediate action was considered necessary eight times.      Patients appreciated the system highly, rating it with an average score of 8.0 on      a 10-point scale. All patients used the monitoring function, and rated      'monitoring' with a mean score of 8.0 on a 10-point scale. Least used and      appreciated was the 'contact with fellow sufferers' function. Only 8 out of      possible 36 GPs used the system, rating it with an average of 5.6 on a 10-point      scale. CONCLUSIONS: The electronic health information support system was used      intensively and highly appreciated by H&N cancer patients. The system enabled the      early detection of occurring health problems that required direct intervention.      ICT can play an additional role in the management of patients, also in a      relatively elderly and computer illiterate patient population.

PMID- 16043391   - BACKGROUND: As the demands on the emergency medicine (EM) system continue to      increase, improvements in the organization of work and the access to timely      clinical and system information will be required for providers to manage their     workload in a safe and efficient manner. Information technology (IT) solutions      are beginning to find their place in the emergency department (ED) and it is time      to begin understanding how these systems are effecting physician behavior,      communication and workload. METHODS: The study used a time-in-motion, primary      task analyses to study faculty and resident physician behavior in the presence of      an electronic whiteboard. The NASA-Task Load Index (TLX) was used to measure      subjective workload and the underlying dimensions of workload at the end of each       physician observation. Work, communication and workload were characterized using       descriptive statistics and compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests. RESULTS:      Physicians in our study performed more tasks and were interrupted less than      physicians studied previously in conventional EDs. Interruptions interrupted      direct patient care tasks less than other clinical activities. Temporary      interruptions appear to be a major source of inefficiency in the ED, and likely a      major threat to patient safety. Face-to-face interruptions persist even in the      presence of advanced IT systems, such as the electronic whiteboard. Faculty      physicians exhibited lower workload scores than resident physicians. Frustration       was a significant contributing factor to workload in resident physicians. All      physicians ranked temporal demands and mental demands as major contributing      factors to workload. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the electronic      whiteboard improves the efficiency of work and communication in the ED. IT      solutions may have great utility in improving provider situational awareness and       distributing workload among ED providers. The results also demonstrate that IT      solutions alone will not solve all problems in the ED. IT solutions will probably      be most effective in improving efficiency and safety outcomes when paired with      human-based interventions, such as crew resource management. Future studies must       investigate team interaction, workload and situational awareness, and the      association of these factors to patient and provider outcomes.

PMID- 16043091   - Health care and health information have been around since the time of Hippocrates      or even before. Through the historical evolution, it is observed that the      knowledge and information that were simple and easy to learn and retain by that      time, became much more complex. This paper presents a brief reviewing on the      evolution of MEDINFO conferences, and how nursing informatics grew up and made      itself visible during all these years of IMIA conferences.

PMID- 16043090   - PURPOSE: Many criteria have been developed to rate the quality of online health      information. To effectively evaluate quality, consumers must use quality criteria      that can be reliably assessed. However, few instruments have been validated for     inter-rater agreement. Therefore, we assessed the degree to which two raters      could reliably assess 22 popularly cited quality criteria on a sample of 42      complementary and alternative medicine Web sites. METHODS: We determined the      degree of inter-rater agreement by calculating the percentage agreement, Cohen's       kappa, and prevalence- and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK). RESULTS: Our     un-calibrated analysis showed poor inter-rater agreement on eight of the 22      quality criteria. Therefore, we created operational definitions for each of the      criteria, decreased the number of assessment choices and defined where to look      for the information. As a result 18 of the 22 quality criteria were reliably      assessed (inter-rater agreement > or = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that even      with precise definitions, some commonly used quality criteria cannot be reliably       assessed. However, inter-rater agreement can be improved with precise operational      definitions.

PMID- 16043089   - Generating clear, readable, and accurate reports can be a time-consuming task for     physicians. Clinical notes, which document patient encounters, often contain a      certain set of patient information including demographics, medical history,      surgical history, examination results or the current medical condition that is      propagated from one clinical note to all subsequent clinical notes for the same      patient. To this end, we present a system, which automatically generates this      patient information for the creation of a new clinical note. We use semantic      patterns and an approximate sequence matching algorithm for capturing the      discourse role of sentences, which we show to be a useful feature for determining      whether the sentence should be repeated. Our system is shown to perform better     than a simple baseline metric using precision/recall results. We believe such a      system would allow clinical notes to be more complete, timely, and accurate.

PMID- 16043088   - In order to determine whether differences exist between housestaff and faculty      physician acceptance of an electronic health record system, we conducted a      written survey of attitudes towards new electronic medical record at the      University of Illinois at Chicago. We surveyed 330 faculty and housestaff      physicians. User acceptance of the EHR was high for both faculty physicians and      housestaff. An amount of 88.0% of the housestaff and 64.7% of the faculty      preferred the EHR over a paper record. Although both housestaff and faculty      acceptance of an EHR was high, housestaff showed greater approval ratings than      faculty. Central to acceptance of an EHR is conservation of physician time,      including improving system speed, reducing time spent waiting for a computer to      become available, and minimizing time spent documenting care.

PMID- 16043087   - The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of medication ordering and       administration functions of CPOE on doctor-nurse communications and cooperation.       We performed an extensive analysis of the work situations in several departments       of three different hospitals. One of the hospitals is still using paper-based      orders, the second one is currently implementing a patient care information      system (PCIS), but the analysis was carried out with paper-based orders. The      third hospital has a PCIS installed with available medication ordering functions.      We used standard methods from cognitive psychology to analyze physicians, and      nurses' activity, communications and cooperation. This approach was combined with      a usability analysis of both work systems, paper and computer-based. The      paper-based situation is characterized by a synchronous cooperation with a      distributed decision-making where physicians and nurses rely mostly on verbal      communications to coordinate their actions; paper order sheets are weakly      structured and poorly support the documentation task. In the computer situation,       physicians and nurses work in an asynchronous mode, and leave to the system the      coordination of their actions. Orders are exhaustively documented but some data      may be misinterpreted. Some of these problems are due to usability flaws of the      Human Computer Interface. We conclude with recommendations for usability      improvement of CPOE systems, combined with recommendations for the organization      of doctor-nurse communication when implementing such systems.

PMID- 16043086   - Natural language processing (NLP) systems have demonstrated utility in parsing      narrative texts for purposes such as surveillance and decision support. However,       there has been little work related to NLP of nursing narratives. The purpose of      this study was to compare the semantic categories of a NLP system (Medical      Language Extraction and Encoding [MedLEE] system) with the semantic domains,      categories, and attributes of the International Standards Organization (ISO)      reference terminology models for nursing diagnoses and nursing actions. All but      two MedLEE diagnosis and procedure-related semantic categories mapped to ISO      models. In some instances, we found exact correspondence between the semantic      structures of MedLEE and the ISO models. In other situations (e.g. aspects of      Site or Location), the ISO model was not as granular as MedLEE. For clinical      procedure and non-invasive examination, two ISO nursing action model components      (Action and Target) mapped to a single MedLEE semantic category. The ISO models      are applicable to NLP of nursing narratives. However, the ISO models require      additional specification of selected semantic categories for the abstract      semantic domains in order to achieve the objective of using NLP to parse and      encode data from nursing narratives. Our analysis also suggests areas for     extension of MedLEE particularly in regard to represent nursing actions.

PMID- 16043085   - As part of ongoing research to investigate the impact of patient characteristics,      organization characteristics and patient unit characteristics on safety and      quality outcomes, we used a computational modeling program, OrgAhead, to model      patient care units' achievement of patient safety (medication errors and falls)      and quality outcomes. We tuned OrgAhead using data we collected from 32 units in       12 hospitals in Arizona. Validation studies demonstrated acceptable levels of      correspondence between actual and virtual patient units. In this paper, we report      how we used OrgAhead to develop testable hypotheses about the kinds of      innovations that nurse managers might realistically implement on their patient      care units to improve quality and safety outcomes. Our focus was on unit-level      innovations that are likely to be easier for managers to implement. For all but      the highest performing unit (for which we encountered a ceiling effect), we were       able to generate practical strategies that improved performance of the virtual      units that could be implemented by actual units to improve safety and quality      outcomes. Nurse managers have responded enthusiastically to the additional      decision support for quality improvement.

PMID- 16043084   - This paper describes the architecture of the Guide Project, a proposal for     innovation of Health Information Systems, putting together medical and      organizational issues through the Separation of Concerns paradigm. In particular,      we focus on one building block of the architecture: the Guideline Management      System handling the whole life cycle of computerized Clinical Practice      Guidelines. The communication between the Guideline Management System and the      other components of the project architecture is message-based, according to      specific contracts that allow an easy integration of the components developed by       different parties and, in particular, with legacy systems (i.e. existing      electronic patient records). In turn, the Guideline Management System components       are organized in a distributed architecture: an editor to formalize guidelines, a      repository to store and publish them, an enactment system to implement guidelines      instances in a multi-user environment and a reporting system able to completely      trace any individual physician's guideline-based decision process. The repository      is organized in different levels that can be international, national, regional,      down to the specific health care organization, according to the healthcare      delivery policy of a country. Different organizations can get Clinical Practice      Guidelines from the repository, adapt and introduce them in clinical practice.

PMID- 16043083   - BACKGROUND: Evaluation studies of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have      tended to focus on assessments of system quality and clinical performance in a      laboratory setting. Relatively few studies have used field trials to determine if      CDSS are likely to be used in routine clinical settings and whether reminders      generated are likely to be acted upon by end-users. Moreover, such studies when      performed tend not to identify distinct user groups, nor to classify user     feedback. AIM: To assess medical residents' acceptance and adoption of a clinical      reminder system for chronic disease and preventive care management and to use      expressed preferences for system attributes and functionality as a basis for     system re-engineering. DESIGN OF STUDY: Longitudinal, correlational study using a      novel developmental trajectory analysis (DTA) statistical method, followed by a      qualitative analysis based on user satisfaction surveys and field interviews.      SETTING: An ambulatory primary care clinic of an urban teaching hospital offering      comprehensive healthcare services. 41 medical residents used a CDSS over 10      months in their daily practice. Use of this system was strongly recommended but      not mandatory. METHODS: A group-based, semi-parametric statistical modeling      method to identify distinct groups, with distinct usage trajectories, followed by      qualitative instruments of usability and satisfaction surveys and structured      interviews to validate insights derived from usage trajectories. RESULTS:      Quantitative analysis delineates three types of user adoption behavior: "light",       "moderate" and "heavy" usage. Qualitative analysis reveals that clinicians of      distinct types tend to exhibit views of the system consistent with their     demonstrated adoption behavior. Drawbacks in the design of the CDSS identified by      users of all types (in different ways) motivate a redesign based on current      physician workflows. CONCLUSION: We conclude that this mixed methodology has      considerable promise to provide new insights into system usability and adoption      issues that may benefit clinical decision support systems as well as information       systems more generally.

PMID- 16043082   - This paper details the results of the first phase of a project using eLearning to      support students' learning within a simulated environment. The locus was a      purpose built clinical simulation laboratory (CSL) where the School's philosophy       of problem based learning (PBL) was challenged through lecturers using      traditional teaching methods. The solution: a student-centred, problem based      approach to the acquisition of clinical skills that used high quality learning      objects embedded within web pages, substituting for lecturers providing      instruction and demonstration. This encouraged student nurses to explore, analyse      and make decisions within the safety of a clinical simulation. Learning was      facilitated through network communications and reflection on video performances      of self and others. Evaluations were positive, students demonstrating increased      satisfaction with PBL, improved performance in exams, and increased self-efficacy      in the performance of nursing activities. These results indicate that eLearning      techniques can help students acquire clinical skills in the safety of a simulated      environment within the context of a problem based learning curriculum.

PMID- 16043081   - This paper describes an innovative approach to the evaluation of a handheld      prescription writing application. Participants (10 physicians) were asked to      perform a series of tasks involving entering prescriptions into the application      from a medication list. The study procedure involved the collection of data      consisting of transcripts of the subjects who were asked to "think aloud" while      interacting with the prescription writing program to enter medications. All user       interactions with the device were video and audio recorded. Analysis of the      protocols was conducted in two phases: (1) usability problems were identified      from coding of the transcripts and video data, (2) actual errors in entering      prescription data were also identified. The results indicated that there were a      variety of usability problems, with most related to interface design issues. In      examining the relationship between usability problems and errors, it was found      that certain types of usability problems were closely associated with the      occurrence of specific types of errors in prescription of medications.      Implications for identifying and predicting technology-induced error are      discussed in the context of improving the safety of health care information      systems.

PMID- 16027034   - PURPOSE: The Web is an important source of health information for consumers. Use       of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is also increasing. Therefore, we      studied the likelihood that consumers will incidentally encounter CAM information      while searching the Web and the factors that influence retrieval of CAM      information. METHODS: We evaluated results retrieved by 10 cancer-related      searches on six common search engines. RESULTS: Of 1121 search results, 16.2%      displayed CAM information. Sponsored (i.e., paid) results were more likely to      display CAM information than non-sponsored results (38% versus 7.5%, p < 0.001).       In Overture and Google, sponsored results accounted for 51% and 39% of results on      the first page. These search engines also retrieved more CAM web pages. Search      engines distinguished sponsored and non-sponsored results, but disclosure      statements describing the differences were confusing. Cancer type used as the      search keyword did not influence the number of CAM web pages retrieved. However,       synonyms of cancer differed in their retrieval of CAM web pages (p < 0.001).      Consistent with prior studies of Web search engine overlap, we found that 28% of       CAM results were retrieved by two or more search engines. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians      should help consumers recognize sponsored results and encourage search engines to      clearly explain sponsored results.

PMID- 16024286   - OBJECTIVE: An exploratory study to examine interruptive communication patterns of      healthcare staff within an intensive care unit (ICU) during ward rounds. METHODS:      The study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia. Nine      participants were observed individually, for a total of 24 h, using the      communication observation method (COM). The amount of time spent in conversation,      the number of conversation initiating and number of turn-taking interruptions      were recorded. RESULTS: Participants averaged 75% [95% confidence interval      72.8-77.2] of their time in communication events during ward rounds. There were      345 conversation-initiating interruptions (C.I.I.) and 492 turn-taking      interruptions (T.T.I.). C.I.I. accounted for 37% [95% CI 33.9-40.1] of total      communication event time (5 h: 53 min). T.T.I. accounted for 5.3% of total      communication event time (56 min). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to      specifically examine turn-taking interruptions in a clinical setting. Staff in      this intensive care unit spent the majority of their time in communication. Turn       taking interruptions within conversations occurred at about the same frequency as      conversation initiating interruptions, which have been the subject of earlier     studies. These results suggest that the overall burden of interruptions in some      settings may be significantly higher than previously suspected.

PMID- 16024285   - Good cooperation between health care (HC) professionals, patient, and family is      indispensable during homecare as mentioned in reports and analyses from different      countries. In a French National project named coordination for the quality of      care (COQUAS), we aimed to address the problem of improving such cooperation with      current tools and techniques. We hypothesized that, as in some other domains, a      better integration of use and users in informatics systems could improve the      usefulness of the cooperative tool. The first part of this paper is devoted to      the cognitive analysis of the homecare process and highlights the requirements      which should be met according to this analysis. We describe some specific      features of asynchronous cooperation and some communication issues in the      cooperation of HC workers. We then detail the analysis of the homecare process:      methodology, description of the processes, cognitive activity analyses, and of      the requirements which flow from this analysis. The second part of this paper     proposes a framework and then describes a modular system prototype, designed to      take into account these requirements, including aspects of both cooperation and      interoperability. It uses a meta-description of actions and information derived      from a cognitive study to build dynamically the interface settings; it respects      the current trend in distributed architecture and uses XML communication of      messages, manages complex coordination with a workflow and allows mobile work.      The last part of the paper presents the evaluation which has been done with the      implemented prototype, with actual homecare users.

PMID- 16023888   - BACKGROUND: Coordinated teams with multidisciplinary team conferences are      generally seen as a solution to the management of complex health conditions.      However, problems regarding the process of communication during team conferences       are reported, such as the absence of a common language or viewpoint and the      exchange of irrelevant or repeated information. To determine the outcome of      interventions aimed at improving communication during team conferences, a      reliable and valid assessment method is needed. AIM: To investigate the      feasibility of a theory-based measurement instrument for assessing the process of      the communication during multidisciplinary team conferences in rheumatology.      METHOD: An observation instrument was developed based on communication theory.      The instrument distinguishes three types of communication: (I) grounding      activities, (II) coordination of non-team activities, and (III) coordination of      team activities. To assess the process of communication during team conferences      in a rheumatology clinic with inpatient and day patient facilities, team      conferences were videotaped. To determine the inter-rater reliability, in 20      conferences concerning 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis admitted to the      inpatient unit, the instrument was applied by two investigators independently.      Content validity was determined by analysing and comparing the results of initial      and follow-up team conferences of 25 consecutive patients with rheumatoid      arthritis admitted to the day patient unit (Wilcoxon signed rank test). RESULTS:       The inter-rater reliability was excellent with the intra-class correlation      coefficients being >0.98 for both types I and III communications in 10 initial      and 10 follow-up conferences (type II was not observed). An analysis of an      additional 25 initial and 86 follow-up team conferences showed that time spent on      grounding (type I) made up the greater part of the contents of communication (87%      S.D. 14 and 60% S.D. 29 in initial and follow-up conferences, respectively),      which is significantly more compared to time spent on co-ordination (p<0.001 and       0.02 for categories II and III, respectively). Moreover, significantly less time       spent was spent on grounding in follow-up as compared to initial team      conferences, whereas the time spent on coordination (type III) increased (both      p-values<0.001). CONCLUSION: This theory-based measurement instrument for     describing and evaluating the communication process during team conferences      proved to be reliable and valid in this pilot study. Its usefulness to detect      changes in the communication process, e.g. after implementing systems for     re-structuring team conferences mediated by ICT applications, should be further     examined.

PMID- 16023409   - OBJECTIVES: Ubiquitous computing with multiple interaction devices requires new      interface models that support user-specific modifications to applications and      facilitate the fast development of active workspaces. METHODS: We have developed       NOSTOS, a computer-augmented work environment for clinical personnel to explore      new user interface paradigms for ubiquitous computing. NOSTOS uses several      devices such as digital pens, an active desk, and walk-up displays that allow the      system to track documents and activities in the workplace. RESULTS: We present      the distributed user interface (DUI) model that allows standalone applications to      distribute their user interface components to several devices dynamically at      run-time. This mechanism permit clinicians to develop their own user interfaces      and forms to clinical information systems to match their specific needs. We      discuss the underlying technical concepts of DUIs and show how service discovery,      component distribution, events and layout management are dealt with in the NOSTOS      system. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DUIs--and similar network-based user     interfaces--will be a prerequisite of future mobile user interfaces and essential      to develop clinical multi-device environments.

PMID- 16023408   - Group work is an essential part of modern health care. Although there have been      advances in the technology of communication, these have not necessarily led to      efficient and effective communication among collaborating health-care      professionals. Instead, barriers such as varied organizational cultures,      different training backgrounds, and varied time schedules can overwhelm      technological solutions and impede efficient communication. We focus on one      particular sort of collaboration, that of group work around a clinical trial      protocol, where the collaboration is asynchronous and the participants are      geographically distributed. In this work setting, we have applied a      computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) approach in two distinct ways. First,       we used observational methods to uncover and understand a complex set of      communication behaviors and needs. Second, we used participatory design and      iterative prototyping to design a system that aims to improve communication and      work flow among these collaborators. We found that these methods work well in      tandem-our observational study helped better inform our design, and our     prototyping cycles provided additional insight into the work. More specifically,       we were able to identify a set of communication problems in the work that led us       to specify a set of design desiderata for systems that support asynchronous      collaboration around an evolving medical document.

PMID- 16023407   - A multi-site study, conducted in two English and two Danish intensive care units,      investigates the complexity of work processes in intensive care, and the      implications of this complexity for information management with regards to      clinical information systems. Data were collected via observations, shadowing of       clinical staff, interviews and questionnaires. The construction of role activity       diagrams enabled the capture of critical care work processes. Upon analysing      these diagrams, it was found that intensive care work processes consist of      'simplified-complexity', these processes are changed with the introduction of      information systems for the everyday use and management of all clinical      information. The prevailing notion of complexity surrounding critical care      clinical work processes was refuted and found to be misleading; in reality, it is      not the work processes that cause the complexity, the complexity is rooted in the      way in which clinical information is used and managed. This study emphasises that      the potential for clinical information systems that consider integrating all      clinical information requirements is not only immense but also very plausible.

PMID- 16005258   - BACKGROUND: While there may be benefits that accrue to the use of telemedicine      technology in patient care, such as decreased costs and improved access, it has      yet to be determined how telemedicine impacts patients' ability to express      themselves and accordingly, how it impacts health care providers' communication      of instructions or expressions of empathy. AIM: The aim of this study was to      examine the effect of telemedicine technology on communication by comparing the      style and content of communication between actual (i.e., face to face) and      virtual (i.e., non-face to face, telemedical) dermatology visits. The hypothesis       was that there is no difference in the content and style of communication between      actual and virtual visits in dermatology. METHODS: Face-to-face and      video-mediated dermatology sessions were observed and also audiotaped, timed and       transcribed. A content analysis was performed. RESULTS: Average duration of a      face-to-face session was 11 min (S.D. 0.08) and of a telemedical session 9 min      (S.D. 0.002). Small talk occurred in 20% of all face-to-face and 29.6% of all      telemedical visits. Clinical assessment occurred in all sessions. Patient      education occurred in 90% of face-to-face and 78% of telemedical visits. Other     themes were also identified (e.g., discussion of treatment, promotion of      compliance, psychosocial issues). In 14.8% of telemedical sessions technical      issues were raised. Findings indicate that communication patterns in the two      modes of care delivery are comparable.

PMID- 16005257   - When a person gets a cancer diagnosis the need for medical guidance often      appears. In Norway, one of the providers of medical guidelines is the Norwegian      Cancer Association where oncological nurses assist people with a cancer diagnosis      or their relatives. The nurses search through both national and internal      guidebooks and web pages. The input to this process is mostly discharge letters.       The whole process is time consuming. To serve more patients, PaSent, a web-based       intelligent oncological nurse advisor, has been developed. Through using      discharge letters as input to our neural network-based information retrieval      system PaSent, we have been able to provide relevant medical information to the      patient as well as to the health personnel themselves. The PaSent search method      uses predefined knowledge about the context, paired with the vocabulary of the      input document, to compute a relevance measure for a potential result document.      The system has been validated by oncological nurses and medical doctors. In the      reported experiments, the PaSent system is able to recommend literature, in the      top section of the search result list, that our judges also found highly      relevant.

PMID- 15996516   - INTRODUCTION: The New Zealand National Poisons Centre has developed an extensive       clinical poisons information database, TOXINZ. This resource was originally      provided on a CD-Rom, and in 2002 made accessible solely via the Internet      (www.toxinz.com). It was unknown whether users would prefer the CD-Rom or     Internet version to access the same information. METHODS: In September 2003 a      total of 100 questionnaires were mailed to the emergency departments of 15      hospitals to be answered by medical and nursing staff utilizing the Internet      version of TOXINZ. The results were then compared with a nearly identical      questionnaire conducted in the same way in the same hospitals when only the      CD-Rom database version was available. RESULTS: There was a 79% response rate      with both medical and nursing staff rating the poisons management recommendations      highly when accessed both on CD-Rom and Internet. Statistically significant      differences (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) identified the Internet accessed      database as: supplying better visual aids, being more repetitive, harder to      search, and more difficult to print. CONCLUSION: Those developing Internet      accessible databases for a healthcare environment are encouraged to incorporate      robust search functionality, mobility solutions, and an ability to integrate with      other healthcare applications.

PMID- 15996515   - PURPOSE: This paper appraises empirical studies examining the impact of clinical       information-retrieval technology on physicians and medical students. METHODS: The      world literature was reviewed up to February 2004. Two reviewers independently      identified studies by scrutinising 3368 and 3249 references from bibliographic      databases. Additional studies were retrieved by hand searches, and by searching      ISI Web of Science for citations of articles. Six hundred and five paper-based      articles were assessed for relevance. Of those, 40 (6.6%) were independently      appraised by two reviewers for relevance and methodological quality. These      articles were quantitative, qualitative or of mixed methods, and 26 (4.3%) were      retained for further analysis. For each retained article, two teams used content       analysis to review extracted textual material (quantitative results and      qualitative findings). RESULTS: Observational studies suggest that nearly      one-third of searches using information-retrieval technology may have a positive       impact on physicians. Two experimental and three laboratory studies do not reach       consensus in support of a greater impact of this technology compared with other     sources of information, notably printed educational material. Clinical      information-retrieval technology may affect physicians, and further research is      needed to examine its impact in everyday practice.

PMID- 15990357   - Despite the growing interest in adopting information technology (IT) in      healthcare, the degree of technology sophistication varies among healthcare      organizations. Changes in the health care sector and continuous pressure to      improve the quality of care have driven the evolution of IT in hospitals. This      paper provides an overview of clinical IT sophistication in a sample of U.S.      hospitals, and compares clinical IT capacities in this sample with a sample of      Canadian hospitals. The instrument used for the comparison measures three      clinical dimensions of IT sophistication: functional sophistication,      technological sophistication and integration level. Clinical areas that were      considered include patient management, patient care activities and clinical      support activities. The comparison between hospitals in Iowa and Canada shows      differences in clinical IT sophistication between the two settings. Hospitals in       Iowa appear to have more technologies but fewer computerized processes and      integration of patient management activities. Technological sophistication      however, was low in both samples. Our findings confirm the construct validity of       the measurement instrument and show initial evidence of its generalizability.      More initiatives using the instrument would lead to enhancement in IT assessment       tools that can be used for evaluation of IT in relation to patient management and      quality outcomes.

PMID- 15985385   - PURPOSE: To determine whether physician experience with and attitude towards      computers is associated with adoption of a voluntary ambulatory prescription      writing expert system. METHODS: A prescription expert system was implemented in      an academic internal medicine residency training clinic and physician utilization      was tracked electronically. A physician attitude and behavior survey (response      rate=89%) was conducted six months after implementation. RESULTS: There was wide       variability in system adoption and degree of usage, though 72% of physicians      reported predominant usage (> or =50% of prescriptions) of the expert system six       months after implementation. Self-reported and measured technology usage were      strongly correlated (r=0.70, p<0.0001). Variation in use was strongly associated       with physician attitude toward issues of system efficiency and effect on quality,      but not with prior computer experience, level of training, or satisfaction with      their primary care practice. Non-adopters felt that electronic prescribing was      more time consuming and also more likely to believe that their patients preferred      hand-written prescriptions. CONCLUSION: A voluntary electronic prescription      system was readily adopted by a majority of physicians who believed it would have      a positive impact on the quality and efficiency of care. However, dissatisfaction      with system capabilities among both adopters and non-adopters suggests the      importance of user education and expectation management following system      selection.

PMID- 15979937   - INTRODUCTION: This paper discusses some of the issues and challenges of      implementing appropriate and coordinated District Health Management Information      System (DHMIS) in environments dependent on external support especially when      insufficient attention has been given to the sustainability of systems. It also      discusses fundamental issues which affect the usability of DHMIS to support      District Health System (DHS), including meeting user needs and user education in       the use of information for management; and the need for integration of data from       all health-providing and related organizations in the district. METHODS: This      descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in three DHSs in Kenya. Data      was collected through use of questionnaires, focus group discussions and review      of relevant literature, reports and operational manuals of the studied DHMISs.      RESULTS: Key personnel at the DHS level were not involved in the development and       implementation of the established systems. The DHMISs were fragmented to the      extent that their information products were bypassing the very levels they were      created to serve. None of the DHMISs was computerized. Key resources for DHMIS      operation were inadequate. The adequacy of personnel was 47%, working space 40%,       storage space 34%, stationery 20%, 73% of DHMIS staff were not trained,      management support was 13%. Information produced was 30% accurate, 19% complete,       26% timely, 72% relevant; the level of confidentiality and use of information at       the point of collection stood at 32% and 22% respectively and information      security at 48%. Basic DHMIS equipment for information processing was not      available. This inhibited effective and efficient provision of information      services. CONCLUSIONS: An effective DHMIS is essential for DHS planning,      implementation, monitoring and evaluation activities. Without accurate, timely,      relevant and complete information the existing information systems are not      capable of facilitating the DHS managers in their day-today operational      management. The existing DHMISs were found not supportive of the DHS managers'      strategic and operational management functions. Consequently DHMISs were found to      be plagued by numerous designs, operational, resources and managerial problems.      There is an urgent need to explore the possibilities of computerizing the      existing manual systems to take advantage of the potential uses of microcomputers      for DHMIS operations within the DHS. Information system designers must also      address issues of cooperative partnership in information activities, systems      compatibility and sustainability.

PMID- 15967710   - The success of treatment of patients with cancer depends on establishing an      accurate diagnosis. To this end, we have built a system called GEMS (gene      expression model selector) for the automated development and evaluation of      high-quality cancer diagnostic models and biomarker discovery from microarray      gene expression data. In order to determine and equip the system with the best      performing diagnostic methodologies in this domain, we first conducted a      comprehensive evaluation of classification algorithms using 11 cancer microarray       datasets. In this paper we present a preliminary evaluation of the system with      five new datasets. The performance of the models produced automatically by GEMS      is comparable or better than the results obtained by human analysts.      Additionally, we performed a cross-dataset evaluation of the system. This      involved using a dataset to build a diagnostic model and to estimate its future      performance, then applying this model and evaluating its performance on a      different dataset. We found that models produced by GEMS indeed perform well in      independent samples and, furthermore, the cross-validation performance estimates       output by the system approximate well the error obtained by the independent      validation. GEMS is freely available for download for non-commercial use from      http://www.gems-system.org.

PMID- 15964780   - The research questions, strategies, and results of a 7-year qualitative study of       computerized physician order entry implementation (CPOE) at successful sites are       reviewed over time. The iterative nature of qualitative inquiry stimulates a      consecutive stream of research foci, which, with each iteration, add further     insight into the overarching research question. A multidisciplinary team of      researchers studied CPOE implementation in four organizations using a      multi-method approach to address the question "what are the success factors for     implementing CPOE?" Four major themes emerged after studying three sites; ten      themes resulted from blending the first results with those from a fourth site;      and twelve principles were generated when results of a qualitative analysis of      consensus conference transcripts were combined with the field data. The study has      produced detailed descriptions of factors related to CPOE success and insight      into the implementation process.

PMID- 15963757   - BACKGROUND: Internet use is growing rapidly in Iran. However, little is known      about the rate of Internet access and Internet use habits of gastroenterology      patients and their health information preferences in the country. METHODS: A      two-part questionnaire was presented to a convenience sample of 401 consecutive      outpatients (mean age: 43.7 years) of a referral gastroenterology clinic in      Tehran from February 21 to March 13, 2004. RESULTS: Of all literate patients      (92%), 62% self-estimated their disease-related knowledge as nothing to little.      The most common sources of information were media (62%) and printed materials      (58%). Printed material (57%) and media (35%) were the most preferred means of      receiving health information; the Internet was the most preferred means among      Internet users and almost all of them were interested in getting online medical      services. The cause (65%) and treatment (56%) of disease were the most favorite      knowledge topics. Of all patients 28% could use Internet. Males, more educated      and younger subjects were more likely to use the Internet. Of the Internet users,      37% had already performed at least one search for medical information.      CONCLUSION: Though Internet is not yet a popular means of patient education in      Iran, considering the speedy growth of Internet use and its undeniable advantages      and prospects in a young country like Iran, it seems wise for private and public       health sectors to start more vigorous planning to develop web-based patient      education systems run by trusted bodies and encourage and cultivate its use among      patients.

PMID- 15955732   - Automated signal generation is a growing field in pharmacovigilance that relies      on data mining of huge spontaneous reporting systems for detecting unknown      adverse drug reactions (ADR). Previous implementations of quantitative techniques      did not take into account issues related to the medical dictionary for regulatory      activities (MedDRA) terminology used for coding ADRs. MedDRA is a first      generation terminology lacking formal definitions; grouping of similar medical      conditions is not accurate due to taxonomic limitations. Our objective was to      build a data-mining tool that improves signal detection algorithms by performing       terminological reasoning on MedDRA codes described with the DAML+OIL description       logic. We propose the PharmaMiner tool that implements quantitative techniques      based on underlying statistical and bayesian models. It is a JAVA application      displaying results in tabular format and performing terminological reasoning with      the Racer inference engine. The mean frequency of drug-adverse effect      associations in the French database was 2.66. Subsumption reasoning based on      MedDRA taxonomical hierarchy produced a mean number of occurrence of 2.92 versus       3.63 (p < 0.001) obtained with a combined technique using subsumption and      approximate matching reasoning based on the ontological structure. Semantic      integration of terminological systems with data mining methods is a promising      technique for improving machine learning in medical databases.

PMID- 15941669   - This paper describes a new technique for clustering short time series of gene      expression data. The technique is a generalization of the template-based      clustering and is based on a qualitative representation of profiles which are      labelled using trend Temporal Abstractions (TAs); clusters are then dynamically      identified on the basis of this qualitative representation. Clustering is      performed in an efficient way at three different levels of aggregation of      qualitative labels, each level corresponding to a distinct degree of qualitative       representation. The developed TA-clustering algorithm provides an innovative way       to cluster gene profiles. We show the developed method to be robust, efficient      and to perform better than the standard hierarchical agglomerative clustering      approach when dealing with temporal dislocations of time series. Results of the      TA-clustering algorithm can be visualized as a three-level hierarchical tree of      qualitative representations and as such easy to interpret. We demonstrate the      utility of the proposed algorithm on a set of two simulated data sets and on a      study of gene expression data from S. cerevisiae.

PMID- 15936246   - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a multimedia video CD (VCD) of      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and test its effects on pain knowledge and      pain relief in patients receiving surgery. This multimedia VCD of PCA was created      to convey fundamental knowledge to both patients and their family members and      help patients properly utilize PCA devices to relieve pain and improve recovery.       The content of multimedia VCD of PCA included pre-admission pain education,      introduction of PCA, nursing care procedures, and questions and answers. METHODS:      This study used a quasi-experimental research design to test effects of the      multimedia education program in the experimental group of 30 subjects compared to      the control subjects of equal number (without the multimedia VCD of PCA).      RESULTS: (1) The intervention of multimedia VCD of PCA resulted in a      statistically significant difference in pain knowledge between the experimental      and control groups. (2) Subjects in the experimental group obtained a better     outcome of pain relief compared to control subjects. (3) Subjects in the      experimental group indicated that the multimedia VCD of PCA indeed helped them      effectively operate their PCA devices to relieve surgery pain. CONCLUSIONS: The      clinical application of the multimedia VCD of PCA could help patients improve      knowledge on pain, learn how to use PCA devices, achieve proper pain relief, and       increase effectiveness of recovery activities.

PMID- 15921954   - Despite initiatives to standardize methods for the development of clinical      guidelines, several barriers hinder their integration in daily clinical practice:      failure to fulfil quality criteria, poor effectiveness of their dissemination.      Computerization of guidelines can favor their dissemination. The initial step of       computerization is the knowledge specification from the text of the guideline. We      describe the method of knowledge specification, which is used in EsPeR     (Personalized Estimate of Risks), a web-based decision support system in      preventive medicine, which allows, for a given person, to estimate risks and      access recommendations, based on clinical profile. This method is based on a      structured and systematic analysis of text allowing detailed specification of a      decision tree. We use decision tables to validate the decision algorithm and      decision trees to specify this algorithm, along with elementary messages of      recommendation. Editing tools are used to facilitate the process of validation      and the workflow between expert physicians and computer scientists. Applied to      eleven different guidelines, the method allows a quick and valid computerization       and integration in the EsPeR system. The method used for computerization could      help to define a framework usable at the initial step of guideline development in      order to produce guidelines ready for electronic implementation.

PMID- 15921953   - PURPOSE: OpenSDE is an application intended to support structured data entry in a      variety of settings, such as routine care and clinical research. The past years      development has focused on data entry to support expressiveness and flexibility.       The focus is now shifting to data extraction: what are the possibilities for     extracting the data and does the adopted strategy pose limitations? METHODS: Data      extraction is supported by presenting the concepts for extraction in the same      tree structure as for data entry. Users can select all or a sub selection of      these concepts for extraction. Selected concepts are extracted and converted to a      table format that can be queried using conventional tools. RESULTS: The      extraction tool (entity export) provides a successful technical solution for data      extraction. Using the extracted data, however, leads to obstacles that are a      result of a fundamental design principle of OpenSDE.

PMID- 15914080   - The paper provides detailed descriptions of general practitioners (GPs')      interactions, both with their computers and their patients, with the aim of      facilitating the detailed understanding of how GPs use their computers while in      consultation with patients. The focus is on the coordinated activities of the      doctor and patient and the multitasking that is required during consultation. The      data consists of primary care doctor-patient consultations for asthma and angina       where clinical scenarios, supported by dummy electronic and paper records for use      by the doctor, were played out. Although not 'naturally occurring', the mock      scenario is a traditional medical training technique. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This      paper describes and demonstrates a data transcription methodology, involving      seven discrete levels of activities, developed to account for the intricate      multitasking that occurs in a GP consultation. The transcription method,      developed to support the evaluation of a prototype medical prescribing decision      support system (Prodigy) for use by general practitioners in consultation with      patients, builds on data description techniques from conversation analysis (CA)      and video analysis (VA). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the methodology      described could also be applicable to other scenarios involving the observation      of human-computer-human interaction.

PMID- 15897005   - Current approaches to word sense disambiguation use (and often combine) various      machine learning techniques. Most refer to characteristics of the ambiguity and      its surrounding words and are based on thousands of examples. Unfortunately,      developing large training sets is burdensome, and in response to this challenge,       we investigate the use of symbolic knowledge for small datasets. A naive Bayes      classifier was trained for 15 words with 100 examples for each. Unified Medical      Language System (UMLS) semantic types assigned to concepts found in the sentence       and relationships between these semantic types form the knowledge base. The most       frequent sense of a word served as the baseline. The effect of increasingly      accurate symbolic knowledge was evaluated in nine experimental conditions.      Performance was measured by accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation. The best       condition used only the semantic types of the words in the sentence. Accuracy was      then on average 10% higher than the baseline; however, it varied from 8%      deterioration to 29% improvement. To investigate this large variance, we      performed several follow-up evaluations, testing additional algorithms (decision       tree and neural network), and gold standards (per expert), but the results did      not significantly differ. However, we noted a trend that the best disambiguation       was found for words that were the least troublesome to the human evaluators. We      conclude that neither algorithm nor individual human behavior cause these large      differences, but that the structure of the UMLS Metathesaurus (used to represent       senses of ambiguous words) contributes to inaccuracies in the gold standard,      leading to varied performance of word sense disambiguation techniques.

PMID- 15893502   - OBJECTIVE: To develop terminology for documenting perioperative nursing      interventions. METHOD: Nursing documentation of 250 patients was explored by      content analysis. The study was conducted to validate further the Perioperative      Nursing Data Set (PNDS) in Finland. The data included 3442 terms that were      clustered into 104 nursing interventions. A Delphi-panel (N=5) evaluated the      relevance of each term on a scale from 1 to 4. The structure of each nursing      intervention was checked to meet the minimum requirements of the ISO reference      terminology model for nursing action concepts. Finally, the nursing interventions      were compared with the original PNDS-interventions. RESULTS: The Delphi-panel      accepted 98 nursing interventions with Content Validity Index from 0.88 to 1.0.      Of the 133 nursing interventions in the PNDS, 60% (n=80) were covered by nursing       interventions identified in this study. A notable portion of the nursing      interventions related to preventive aspects of perioperative care and the      patients' coping with perioperative experience. CONCLUSION: The findings      supported the need for cross-cultural validation of a nursing language prior to      clinical implementation. The ISO reference terminology model is recommended as      framework in constructing concepts for nursing interventions in a regular form.

PMID- 15893264   - Wide adoption of mobile computing technology can potentially improve information       access, enhance workflow, and promote evidence-based practice to make informed      and effective decisions at the point of care. Handheld computers or personal      digital assistants (PDAs) offer portable and unobtrusive access to clinical data       and relevant information at the point of care. This article reviews the      literature on issues related to adoption of PDAs in health care and barriers to      PDA adoption. Studies showed that PDAs were used widely in health care providers'      practice, and the level of use is expected to rise rapidly. Most care providers      found PDAs to be functional and useful in areas of documentation, medical      reference, and access to patient data. Major barriers to adoption were identified      as usability, security concerns, and lack of technical and organizational      support. PDAs offer health care practitioners advantages to enhance their     clinical practice. However, better designed PDA hardware and software      applications, more institutional support, seamless integration of PDA technology       with hospital information systems, and satisfactory security measures are      necessary to increase acceptance and wide use of PDAs in healthcare.

PMID- 15893263   - OBJECTIVE: Development of a Semantic Web technology based system for the      formalization of the gross description. METHOD: A system is developed using the      Java-2 platform. It is based on a light-weight version of the Galen top level      ontology. Web technologies like XML, SAX en DOM have been used. RESULT: Three      system components have been developed to support the semantic, the object and the      syntax layers of the PathOnt architecture. CONCLUSION: The PathOnt approach      provides a tool for the communication among clinicians and technicians involved      in pathology examinations. This tool also provides a foundation for linking the      specimen-specific data with the controlled medical ontology so that the stored      information can be used in different circumstances.

PMID- 15893262   - A hospital is a type of system, yet healthcare information technology (IT) has      largely failed to view it as such. The failure to view the hospital as a system      has contributed to the practice of inefficient and ineffective clinical      documentation. This paper seeks to address how current clinical documentation      practices reflect and reinforce inefficiency and poor patient care. It also      addresses how rethinking clinical documentation and IT together may improve the      entire healthcare process by promoting a more integrated and patient-centered      healthcare information paradigm. Rethinking IT in support of clinical      documentation from a system-oriented perspective may help improve patient care      and provider communication.

PMID- 15893261   - OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of specific information in electronic patient      records and the consequences of sub-optimal data quality on automated information      retrieval. METHODS: Patient records were evaluated with respect to accuracy of      data relevant for retrieval according to a source-oriented, time-oriented and      concept-oriented view of the record. Retrieval effectiveness was estimated using       various methods based on record structure, text based retrieval and combinations       of these. RESULTS: 98.1% of record documents were consistent regarding author,      99.8% regarding department of origin and 90.9% regarding document date. Document       type was definitely not consistent in 8% of the documents. Estimated recall was      97% with 50% precision for document retrieval on the basis of date, and varying      from 31 to 100% for retrieval based on document type. Retrieval based on manually      supplied semantic tags performed better than simple string-based methods and      improved when combined with string-matching mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Data      attributes central for automated document retrieval in electronic patient records      showed variable accuracy, with potentially negative consequences for basic record      navigation. Text-based retrieval was inferior to methods based on data      representing record structure. Quality of specific information elements suffered       from lack of precise definitions and adequate mechanisms for quality assurance.

PMID- 15893260   - AIMS: The present study was undertaken to quantify the impact of computerized      drug order entry system (CDOE) connected to the patients' database, on the      incidence and type of prescription errors (PEs) in the medical service, and to      delineate the causes for remaining errors. METHODS: Drug orders were reviewed      daily by a physician-reviewer, in a department of internal medicine that used for     more than 3 years a CDOE (CDOEdept), and in a similar department in which drug      orders were handwritten (HWdept). PEs were divided into those not related to the       individual patient (type 1 PEs), and PEs resulting from drug-laboratory,      drug-disease, and drug-allergy interactions (type 2 PEs). RESULTS: Ten thousand      and two hospitalization days were evaluated. The incidence of type 1 PEs was 5.21      and 1.36 per 100 hospitalization days in the HWdept and CDOEdept, respectively      (p<0.0001). Type 2 PEs were more common, 7.20 and 3.02 per 100 hospitalization      days in the HWdept and CDOEdept, respectively (p<0.0001), and about 75% of them      were due to few drug-laboratory interactions. Most of the remaining errors in the      CDOEdept were due to inadequate adjustment of drugs and doses to renal function,       or failure to perform adequate changes when new laboratory results became      available. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that linking the CDOE with few, specific,      laboratory results has a large impact on the prevention of PEs. Combining the      CDOE with a drug-laboratory alert system is expected to further reduce the      incidence of PEs.

PMID- 15893259   - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a semi-automatic data extraction from the electronic      medical record (EMR) of general practitioners (GPs) through a comparison with a      paper sheets data collection simultaneously used in a primary care research      project on the quality of prescribing for osteoarthritis in the elderly.      SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty-two GPs using five different EMR-software systems      participated with the semi-automatic data extraction from the EMR and 233 GPs      collected data with paper registration sheets. METHODS: The proportion of      patients with respectively a drug prescription, paracetamol, a non-steroidal      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and ibuprofen were compared between the      semi-automatic extraction and the paper data collection and among the      EMR-software systems. RESULTS: Using the semi-automatic data extraction, a      significantly lower proportion of patients on drugs was obtained compared to the       paper data collection (adjusted OR: 0.31; 95% CI 0.25-0.39). However, the      proportion of patients on a specific type of drug was comparable. Within the      results from the semi-automatic extraction, the results were heterogeneous among       the different EMR-software systems. CONCLUSIONS: The semi-automatic data      extraction with multiple EMR-software systems proposed in this study seems      suitable for quality of prescribing assessment in primary care. However, it may      be less reliable when only a single EMR-software is used.

PMID- 15893258   - BACKGROUND: We undertook this investigation to understand the effect of using a      computer in a primary care setting on attitudes toward using computers to improve      health services delivery. METHODS: In this analysis, we compared the      acceptability data from the group of primary care patients from 10      community-based practices who did not use a computer program, and answered the      questions hypothetically, with data from a group of patients who actually used a       program such as one proposed in the survey taken by the first group of patients.       Attitudes toward three uses of the program, screening, counseling and changing      treatments were measured, as well as attitudes toward specific aspects of the      program, such as security. RESULTS: The great majority of patients who used the      program believed that the program was not too long (80.1%), was easy to use      (82.3%) and that the questions were not hard to answer (75.7%). Also, on average       only 20% of patients had concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of using       the program. Patients who had used the computer program were significantly less      likely to favor its use for screening [odds ratio (OR)=0.09, 95% confidence      interval (CI)=0.04-0.19], counseling [OR=0.13 (95% CI=0.05-0.31)] and changing      treatments for chronic conditions, such as hypertension [OR=0.12 (95%      CI=0.07-0.23)]. Patients who felt that the computer took too long to use were      less likely to favor its use for each of the three uses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite      acceptability ratings that were high and consistent with ratings observed in      other studies, exposure to the program significantly diminished support for using      it in routine care. These findings highlight the need for measuring overall      program acceptability in the context of a realistic use scenario and for     correlating overall acceptability with acceptability of individual program      components and attitudes, as a means for identifying opportunities for program      improvement.

PMID- 15893257   - Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in      sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting      care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for     quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana       and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national      referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western      Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS      care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and      treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into      a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate      testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal      Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who      understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor     settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than       4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the      development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that      include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based      platform.

PMID- 15890558   - PURPOSE: This description focuses on the expressiveness and flexibility of      OpenSDE: an application that supports recording of structured narrative data.      METHODS: OpenSDE enables data entry with (customizable) forms based on trees of      medical concepts. The relevant scope for data entry can be tailored per medical      domain by construction of a domain-specific tree. OpenSDE is intended for     structuring narrative data to make these available for both care and research.      RESULTS: The OpenSDE application is currently in use at several departments in      our academic hospital, including radiology, neurology, pediatrics, and child      psychiatry. OpenSDE is available for all in open source.

PMID- 15694640   - Today, the economic and regulatory environment, involving activity-based and      prospective payment systems, healthcare quality and risk analysis, traceability      of the acts performed and evaluation of care practices, accounts for the current       interest in clinical and hospital information systems. The structured gathering      of information relative to users' needs and system requirements is fundamental      when installing such systems. This stage takes time and is generally misconstrued      by caregivers and is of limited efficacy to analysts. We used a modelling      technique designed for manufacturing processes (IDEF0/SADT). We enhanced the      basic model of an activity with descriptors extracted from the Ishikawa      cause-and-effect diagram (methods, men, materials, machines, and environment). We      proposed an object data model of a process and its components, and programmed a      web-based tool in an object-oriented environment. This tool makes it possible to       extract the data dictionary of a given process from the description of its      elements and to locate documents (procedures, recommendations, instructions)      according to each activity or role. Aimed at structuring needs and storing      information provided by directly involved teams regarding the workings of an      institution (or at least part of it), the process-mapping approach has an      important contribution to make in the analysis of clinical information systems.

PMID- 15694639   - DICOM 3 is a very elaborate standard for the communication between medical image       devices. It is published in several parts by the National Electrical      Manufacturers Association (NEMA). To adequately visualize the data structure      defined in parts 3, 5 and 6 of the DICOM standard, we implemented the web based      Dicom Search Engine (DicoSE). It allows for querying the DICOM standard data      dictionary for defined data fields and visualizes the topology of the data which       is inherently present in DICOM datasets. For the administration of the underlying      data a web based administration interface is provided. The service is entirely      based on freely available software.

PMID- 15694638   - Bio-medical knowledge bases are valuable resources for the research community.      Original scientific publications are the main source used to annotate them.      Medical annotation in Swiss-Prot is specifically targeted at finding and      extracting data about human genetic diseases and polymorphisms. Curators have to       scan through hundreds of publications to select the relevant ones. This workload       can be greatly reduced by using bio-text mining techniques. Using a combination      of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and statistical classifiers, we      achieve recall points of up to 84% on the potentially interesting documents and a      precision of more than 96% in detecting irrelevant documents. Careful analysis of      the document pre-processing chain allows us to measure the impact of some steps      on the overall result, as well as test different classifier configurations. The      best combination was used to create a prototype of a search and classification      tool that is currently tested by the database curators.

PMID- 15694637   - Since clinical management of patients and clinical research are essentially      time-oriented endeavours, reasoning about time has become a hot topic in medical       informatics. Here we present a method for prognosis of temporal courses, which      combines temporal abstractions with case-based reasoning. It is useful for     application domains where neither well-known standards, nor known periodicity,      nor a complete domain theory exist. We have used our method in two prognostic      applications. The first one deals with prognosis of the kidney function for     intensive care patients. The idea is to elicit impairments on time, especially to      warn against threatening kidney failures. Our second application deals with a      completely different domain, namely geographical medicine. Its intention is to      compute early warnings against approaching infectious diseases, which are      characterised by irregular cyclic occurrences. So far, we have applied our     program on influenza and bronchitis. In this paper, we focus on influenza      forecast and show first experimental results.

PMID- 15694636   - In most hospital medical units, multidisciplinary committees meet weekly to      discuss their patients' cases. The medical experts base their decisions on three       sources of information. First, they check if their patient complies with existing      guidelines. Failing these, the medical experts will base their therapeutic      decisions on the cases of similar patients that they have treated in the past. We      propose a multi-modal reasoning decision-support system based on both guideline      and case series, which will automatically compare the patient's case to the      corresponding guideline, then to other cases, and retrieve similar cases. The      general structure of the system is presented here, the domain of application      being oncology. As the patients' records are not currently stored in a database      in a format which is directly accessible, an object-oriented model is proposed,      which includes prognosis factors currently tested in clinical trials,      well-established ones, and a description of the illness episodes. The system is      designed to be a data warehouse. Such a system does not exist in the literature.       Future work will be needed to define the similarity measures, and to connect the       system to the current database.

PMID- 15694635   - We present BITOLA, an interactive literature-based biomedical discovery support      system. The goal of this system is to discover new, potentially meaningful      relations between a given starting concept of interest and other concepts, by      mining the bibliographic database MEDLINE. To make the system more suitable for     disease candidate gene discovery and to decrease the number of candidate      relations, we integrate background knowledge about the chromosomal location of      the starting disease as well as the chromosomal location of the candidate genes      from resources such as LocusLink and Human Genome Organization (HUGO). BITOLA can      also be used as an alternative way of searching the MEDLINE database. The system       is available at http://www.mf.uni-lj.si/bitola/.

PMID- 15694634   - Communication and co-operation in healthcare and welfare require a certain set of      trusted third party (TTP) services describing both status and relation of      communicating principals as well as their corresponding keys and attributes.      Additional TTP services are needed to provide trustworthy information about      dynamic issues of communication and co-operation such as time and location of      processes, workflow relations, and system behaviour. Legal and ethical      requirements demand securely stored patient information and well-defined access      rights. Among others, electronic signatures based on asymmetric cryptography are       important means for securing the integrity of a message or file as well as for     accountability purposes including non-repudiation of both origin and receipt.      Electronic signatures along with certified time stamps or time signatures are      especially important for electronic archives in general, electronic health      records (EHR) in particular, and especially for typical purposes of long-lasting       storage. Apart from technical storage problems (e.g. lifetime of the storage      devices, interoperability of retrieval and presentation software), this paper     identifies mechanisms of e.g. re-signing and re-stamping of data items, files,      messages, sets of archived items or documents, archive structures, and even whole      archives.

PMID- 15694633   - Most healthcare data is narrative text and often not accessible and easy to find       at the clinical workstation. XML related standards (XML schema, XForms, XSL,      Topic Maps, etc.) provide an infrastructure that might change the situation. Yet,      it is up to the application developers to combine the given standards and tools      into a running system. The cost of development is often underestimated and may      explain the absence of comprehensive XML applications. Our goal is the clinical      application of these standards. We have, therefore, implemented the idea of      "plug-and-play XML", i.e. the development of new applications by means of XML      standards. This paper will communicate our experience using such an approach at      the example of a clinical drug information system.

PMID- 15694632   - Privacy includes the right of individuals and organisations to determine for     themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to      others. The growing need of managing large amounts of both clinical and genetic      data raises important legal and ethical challenges. This paper introduces some of      the privacy-protection problems related to classical and genomic medicine, and      highlights the relevance of trusted third parties and of privacy-enhancing      techniques (PETs) in the context of data collection, e.g., for research.      Practical approaches based on two pseudonymisation models, for both batch data      collection and interactive data storage, are presented. The actual application of      the described techniques today proves the possible benefits for medicine that      innovative privacy-enhancing techniques can provide. Technical PET solutions can       unlock valuable data sources, otherwise not available.

PMID- 15694631   - PROBLEM: Although electronic communication of clinical data between various      actors in the healthcare domain seems crucial for a cost-effective patient      treatment, it is mostly restricted to paper based documents. In order to meet the      growing need for improved data communication, it is necessary to overcome the      barriers of software heterogeneity and lack of standards, especially in      cross-institutional shared care communication. HL7's clinical document      architecture (CDA) is a new and promising tool to exchange any clinical document.      In this paper we show how CDA can be used to (1) share electronic discharge      letters and other clinical data generated and stored in the hospitals electronic       patient record (EPR) with general practitioners and (2) to transfer these      clinical data to a personal electronic health record (EHR). The latter scenario      is in routine use. Ease-of-use and data security and integrity were the main      design principles in both scenarios. METHODS: Within the electronic patient      record a data extraction and exporting mechanism has been built. For both      scenarios appropriate data processing and transmission methods have been      developed, and the receiving information systems have been prepared for the CDA      based data input. RESULTS: Although there still remain technical and      organizational issues to be solved, this is a promising method in order to      enhance data exchange between hospital and primary care and to move towards an      electronic patient record (EPR) and an electronic health record (EHR) crossing      institutional borders. This paper describes the design and current implementation      and discusses our experiences.

PMID- 15694630   - INTRODUCTION: The PropeR EHR system (PropeRWeb) is a multidisciplinary electronic      health record (EHR) system for multidisciplinary use in extramural patient care      for stroke patients. DESIGN: The system is built using existing open source      components and is based on open standards. It is implemented as a web application      using servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP's) with a CORBA connection to the      database servers, which are based on the OMG HDTF specifications. PropeRWeb is a       generic system which can be readily customized for use in a variety of clinical      domains. EVALUATION: The system proved to be stable and flexible, although some      aspects (a.o. user friendliness) could be improved. These improvements are      currently under development in a second version.

PMID- 15694629   - The Danish EHR-Observatory has monitored Danish EHR projects for several years      with respect to a number of parameters such as diffusion, diffusion rate,      barriers and limitations, and experience gained. The results of the 2002      monitoring reveal that investment in IT is relatively low and the diffusion rate       is below the estimated level. The EHR projects gain a lot of valuable experience,      but the coordination of evaluation results should be improved.

PMID- 15694628   - Development of the electronic health record architecture at the EuroMISE Center     was inspired by existing European standards and several European projects. The      developed EHR named MUDR implements a 3-layer architecture, using XML for     communication between application layer and clients. A decision support module      implementing the "1999 WHO/ISH Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension" is       part of an application layer. Universal graph structure is used both to represent      the set of medical concepts in the EHR and to represent the collected data.      Advanced methods of interaction between EHR and its user are studied, software      prototypes of client applications are developed and their effectiveness      evaluated.

PMID- 15694627   - The Danish Health IT strategy [Danish Ministry of Interior and Health, National      Strategy for IT in the Health Sector 2003-2007, Copenhagen, 2003 (in Danish).      http://www.im.dk/publikationer/itstrategi/itstrategi.pdf. notes that integration       between electronic health records (EHR) systems has a high priority. A      prerequisite for real integration and semantic interoperability is agreement of      the data content and the information models. The National Board of Health is      working on a common model for EHR, and its adoption is now being promoted through      pilot projects. At the same time, several development and implementation projects      are taking place at a regional level. These EHRs are built on information models       from different vendors and are based on different integration platforms. The      Danish EHR observatory, which has been monitoring the development of EHRs in      Denmark since 1998, has analysed the challenges of using different information      models and integration platforms. This paper also maps the development in Denmark      to the new paradigms in modelling techniques and integration technology.

PMID- 15694626   - This paper describes a comparative evaluation of two applications delivering a      multimedia course: a conventional web server (WS) and an integrated e-learning      platform in the form of a virtual campus (VC). We used a qualitative method for     comparing their acceptance of the on-line course provided by the two different      interfaces. The two groups were globally satisfied. However, a decrease in      satisfaction was noted at the end of the experimentation in the VC group. This      may be explained by a more complex graphic user interface of the VC and some      constraints which do not exist with the WS. Students from both groups also had      limitations about the multimedia environment.

PMID- 15694625   - The objective of this paper is to describe our experience in developing a tool      based on web technologies, for storing, managing and providing medical courses      written by professors in the medical university of Rennes. The increasing number       of documents sent by professors leaded us to build a specific resource management      system. We created a relational database, containing all meta information about      each available document. Professors provide their courses in various formats. We       use natural language parsing techniques to extract information from the text, and      provide a proper semantic indexation which will be used by a medical-specific      search engine. Then the content of our database is dynamically displayed on a web      interface. A user's directory identifies teachers and students, controls the      access, tracks the students' navigation and allows an on-line discussion forum.      This portal contains 524 courses and we had more than 3,000,000 connections on it      last year. We are now integrating its content using the semantic web approach in       a larger project: the French Virtual Medical University.

PMID- 15694624   - In recent years, the concept of "global cardiovascular risk assessment" has grown      in interest for its role in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.      Interventions for reducing the risk of relapse for persons with cardiovascular     past history are well agreed-on. But for persons without such a history, the risk      of a first attack varies greatly and this variability implies a range in the      intensity of interventions. In several countries, guidelines for general      practitioners have been diffused about pharmaceutical prescriptions in the      different risk classes. In particular, in Italy, a governmental drug management      commission has established that Statins, the most used cholesterol lowering      medicines, can be refunded by the National Healthcare System only if they are      prescribed to hyper-cholesterol patients with a global risk greater than 20%. The      question is: how to calculate the risk? We performed a review of both the web and      the literature and we found a lot of different "risk calculators". By means of a       simulation study, we showed that these tools, when used for the same person, may       lead to very different results. We estimated the economic impact of using one or       another calculator.

PMID- 15694623   - This paper describes a multi-dimensional assessment method to support the choice       and acquisition process for Clinical Information Systems. The method addresses      three different dimensions: (1) Quality management, which evaluates the      fulfillment of Users Requirements, and the Users' satisfaction with the existing       functions; (2) Usability assessment, which includes a Usability inspection, and a      Usability test; (3) Performance evaluation, which assesses the exhaustiveness and      quality of documentation. The method is illustrated using the case study of a      Clinical Information System (CIS) acquisition for anaesthesiology. It proved      efficient and promising as a support for the decision process, for enhancing      users' involvement in the project, and for initiating the necessary      re-engineering of the Human Computer Interface.

PMID- 15694622   - Digitalization of audiovisual resources and network capability offer many      possibilities which are the subject of intensive work in scientific and      industrial sectors. Indexing such resources is a major challenge. Recently, the      Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) has developed MPEG-7, a standard for     describing multimedia content. The goal of this standard is to develop a rich set      of standardized tools to enable efficient retrieval from digital archives or the       filtering of audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet. How could this kind of      technology be used in the medical context? In this paper, we propose a simpler     indexing system, based on the Dublin Core standard and compliant to MPEG-7. We      use MeSH and the UMLS to introduce conceptual navigation. We also present a      video-platform which enables encoding and gives access to audiovisual resources      in streaming mode.

PMID- 15694621   - Recent advances in automatic speech recognition and related technologies allow      computers to carry on conversations by telephone. We developed an intelligent      dialogue system that interacts with hypertensive patients to collect data about      their health status. Patients thus avoid the inconvenience of traveling for     frequent face to face visits to monitor the clinical variables they can easily      measure at home; the physician is facilitated in acquiring patient information      and cardiovascular risk, which is evaluated from the data according to noted      guidelines. Controlled trials to assess the clinical efficacy are under way.

PMID- 15694620   - Patient education is a significant factor in the provision of health care      services, contributing to improved disease management and health care outcomes.      Personalization has been suggested as a means for increasing patient education      effectiveness and computer-based approaches have been explored as a possible      means of achieving this goal. The success and capabilities of the resulting      applications have been restricted by the absence of a direct link to patient data      and the reliance on locally produced written material, which is expensive to      produce, update and tailor. In our research project STructured Evaluated      Personalized Patient Support (STEPPS), we are investigating the potential of a      novel strategy for personalized or tailored patient education, based on the      integration of electronic patient record data and material derived from online      health information resources. In this paper we present an overview of the      pertinent technical issues and the way we have addressed them in the context of      our development work in the domain of burn care. Further, we discuss how the      choices made in the design of the system interrelate with the considerations for       its implementation in health care practice settings.

PMID- 15694619   - Internet as source of information is increasing in preeminence in numerous      fields, including health. We describe in this paper the CISMeF project (acronym      of Catalogue and Index of French-speaking Medical Sites) which has been designed       to help the health information consumers and health professionals to find what      they are looking for among the numerous health documents available online. The      catalogue is founded on two standards: a set of metadata and a terminology based       on the MeSH thesaurus which has the same structure and use as an ontology of the       medical domain. The structure of the catalogue allows us to place the project at       an overlap between the present Web, which is informal, and the forthcoming      Semantic Web. Many features of information retrieval and navigation through the      catalogue were developed. These features take into account the kind of the      end-user (health professional, medical student, patient). The CISMeF-patients      catalogue is a sub-catalogue of CISMeF and is dedicated to the patients and the      general public. It shares the same model as CISMeF whereas MEDLINE and      MedlinePlus do not. We also propose to couple two approaches (morphological      processing and data mining) to help the users by correcting and refining their     queries.

PMID- 15694618   - OBJECTIVES: To model and implement web portals providing access to certified and       high-quality information in the domain of health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The      Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge sources of the U.S. National      Library of Medicine and principles of implementation resulting from the previous       ARIANE project are described. The XML technology that allows files      transformations by the means of XSLT is briefly presented. RESULTS: The design      and implementation of software modules that exploit knowledge sources, operate      the translation of a user's query to selected information sources, and wrap      obtained results are detailed. Querying documentary and factual medical databases      are presented. DISCUSSION: Current implementation and wrapping perspectives are      discussed in terms of integration and interoperability of health information and       data resources.

PMID- 15694617   - Semantic distance and semantic similarity are two important information retrieval      measures used in word sense disambiguation as well as for the assessment of how      relevant concepts are with respect to the documents in which they are found. A      variety of calculation methods have been proposed in the literature, whereby      methods taking into account the information content of an individual concept      outperform those that do not. In this paper, we present a novel recursive      approach to calculate a concept's information content based on the information      content of the concepts to which it relates. The method is applicable to      extremely large ontologies containing several million concepts and relationships       amongst them. It is shown that a concept's information content as calculated by      this method provides additional information with respect to an ontology that      cannot be approximated by hierarchical edge-counting or human insight. In      addition, it is suggested that the method can be used for quality control within       large ontologies and that it can give you an impression on the structure and the       quality of the ontology.

PMID- 15694616   - Medical Informatics has a constant need for basic medical language processing      tasks, e.g. for coding into controlled vocabularies, free text indexing and      information retrieval. Most of these tasks involve term matching and rely on      lexical resources: lists of words with attached information, including inflected       forms and derived words, etc. Such resources are publicly available for the      English language with the UMLS Specialist Lexicon, but not in other languages.      For the French language, several teams have worked on the subject and built local      lexical resources. The goal of the present work is to pool and unify these      resources and to add extensively to them by exploiting medical terminologies and       corpora, resulting in a unified medical lexicon for French (UMLF). This paper     exposes the issues raised by such an objective, describes the methods on which      the project relies and illustrates them with experimental results.

PMID- 15694615   - Healthcare organizations are facing growing pressures to adopt intelligent      technology to promote quality and safety care in public and private hospitals. In      2000, the Institute of Medicine report also indicated that an estimated 44,000 to      98,000 Americans die annually as a result of preventable medical errors and it      appears that information management in hospitals can help the organization to      improve the quality level. This paper aims to present an experience in the      management of events not compliant with the best practice by monitoring these      events in a hospital. We used ISO standard to implement general quality process      and quality management. This project consists in proposing the possibility of      declaring different dysfunctions and incidents by a simple form integrated into      the intranet services of the hospital for the medical, nursing and administrative      staff. This should lead to quality management of the medical units.

PMID- 15694614   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the PropeR project is to investigate the impact of Active      Computerized Protocol Support (ACPS) on daily care processes in different      settings (home care and hospital care). ACPS consists of an active Protocol      Support System (PSS) that is linked to an Electronic Patient Record system. The      aim of this paper is to describe how we have taken the organizational and social       aspects into account in the hospital setting and the consequences of this      approach for the design of the PSS. METHODS: Socio-technical approaches have been      applied. Observations and interviews with various health care providers were      performed at the hematology and oncology department of the University Hospital      Maastricht. Ten extensive sessions with a specialist physician and research nurse      took place to further elaborate a study protocol and to discuss how it is      integrated in daily practice. The knowledge editor component of Gaston was used      to build a computer interpretable version of the selected protocol. RESULTS AND      CONCLUSIONS: To support the representation of a study protocol integrated in      routine clinical care, a Three-Layer Model was developed. This model      distinguishes the protocol description, local adaptations to the protocol and      communication as three separate layers. These layers have been incorporated into       the knowledge acquisition tool Gaston. The Three-Layer Model makes easy updating       possible, and also supports transferability of computerized (study) protocols to       other organizations.

PMID- 15694613   - Despite the availability of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in most      countries, patients with chronic diseases are still generally inadequately      managed. One difficulty lies in the optimal synchronization of a patient with the      guideline therapeutic strategy, especially when the history of her past      treatments does not follow the recommended sequence of therapies. We propose a      formal model to represent guideline-based therapeutic strategies as a two-level      decision tree. The clinical level is used to identify a patient-specific clinical      situation, on the basis of key elements of clinical examination (complication of       hypertension, associated diseases). The therapeutic level is derived from the      formalization of guideline-based strategies first represented as bidimensional      matrices structured in lines of therapy and levels of therapeutic intention. A      revised version based on the ordering of levels of therapeutic combination is      then developed. The aim is to dynamically provide the best next step of treatment      from the patient's therapeutic-history-based customization of the general      therapeutic sequence established in the guideline for the corresponding clinical       situation. A preliminary in vitro evaluation of the system on actual clinical      cases showed a positive impact on physician compliance with a significant      increase from 16 to 57%.

PMID- 15694612   - Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are being developed as a tool to promote best      practice in medicine. However, the diffusion of paper guidelines has been shown      to only have a limited impact. This is why computerization of CPGs has recently      been suggested as a means to improve their dissemination as well as physicians'      compliance. The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) has been proposed to facilitate      the encoding of CPGs and support the automatic processing of marked-up documents.      In this paper, we explore the automatic generation of a rule base from a textual       guideline using GEM. In this study, we propose an extension of the GEM model that      introduces additional levels of structuring centered on decision variables. This       allows a more efficient representation of the decision processes, which supports       the automatic generation of decision rules from textual guidelines. The 1999      Canadian recommendations for the management of hypertension have been marked-up      as a GEM-encoded instance of our extended DTD. We derived a rule base using an      XML parser to extract the relevant elements to instantiate the IF and THEN      clauses of decision rules. The rule base automatically generated compares      favourably with the manual generation of decision rules in the ASTI project. This      approach is an interesting case study in the computerization of CPGs, as it      illustrates processing steps that are relevant to the various aspects of CPGs      life-cycle, from production to consultation and use.

PMID- 15626637   - OBJECTIVE: The National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System      (UMLS) is a rich source of knowledge in the biomedical domain. The UMLS is used      for research and development across wide range of different applications. In this      paper, we evaluated the coverage of UMLS as compared with medical terms extracted      from Korean medical records and identified differences in concept representation       between two terminology sets. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENT: We measured the concept      coverage of the UMLS. For this study, we mapped the clinical terms extracted from      the discharge records of Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) to the UMLS.      RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of the entry terms used in chief complaint of SNUH      were conceptually matched with the UMLS 'Sign or Symptom' concepts. Fifty-eight      percent of the terms were found to be matched with the UMLS 'Disease or Syndrome'      concept rather than the 'Sign or Symptom' concept. The remaining 7% were not      found in the UMLS concepts. We then analyzed some of different expression      patterns used by the two term sets and addressed issues to be taken into      consideration. CONCLUSION: We found out that the UMLS was comparable with Korean       medical records, since most of concepts of Korean medical records were covered      with the UMLS concepts.

PMID- 15626636   - OBJECTIVES: Systematic information management in hospitals demands for a      strategic information management plan (SIM plan). As preparing a SIM plan is a      considerable challenge we provide a practical guideline that is directly      applicable when a SIM plan is going to be prepared. METHODS: The guideline      recommends a detailed structure of a SIM plan and gives advice about its content       and the preparation process. It may be used as template, which can be adapted to       the individual demands of any hospital. RESULTS: The guideline was used in      several hospitals preparing a SIM plan. Experiences showed that the SIM plans      could be prepared very efficiently and timely using the guideline, that the      proposed SIM plan structure suited well, that the guideline offers enough      flexibility to meet the requirements of the individual hospitals and that the      specific recommendations of the guideline were very helpful. CONCLUSIONS:      Nevertheless, we must strive for a more comprehensive theory of strategic      information management planning which -- in the sense of enterprise architecture       planning -- represents the intrinsic correlations of the different parts of a SIM      plan to a greater extent.

PMID- 15626635   - OBJECTIVE: The number of acute hospital beds is determined by health authorities       using methods based on ratios and/or target bed occupancy rates. These methods      fail to consider the variability in hospitalization demands over time. On the      other hand, the implementation of sophisticated models requires the decision      concerning the number of beds to be made by an expert. Our aim is to develop a      new method that is as simple to use as the ratio method while minimizing the      roundabout approaches of these methods. METHOD: A score was constructed with      three parameters: number of transfers due to lack of space, number of days with      no possibility for S unscheduled admissions and number of days with at least a      threshold of U unoccupied beds. The optimal number of beds is the number for     which both the mean and the standard deviation of the score reach their minimum.       We applied this method to two internal medicine departments and one urological      surgery department and we compared the solutions proposed by this method with      those put forward by the ratio method. RESULTS: The solutions proposed by this      method were intermediate to those calculated by the local and national length of       Stays ratio methods. Simulating an unusual increase in admission requests had no       consequence on the bed number selected, indicating that the method was robust.      CONCLUSION: Our tool represents a real alternative to the ratio methods. A      software has been developed and is now available for use.

PMID- 15626634   - INTRODUCTION: There has been no comprehensive evaluation of the district health      management information systems (DHMISs) since the establishment of these systems       by the Ministry of Health (MoH), in Kenya. This is partly due to lack of defined       criteria for evaluating the systems. The objective of this study is to design      evaluation criteria for assessing the viability, sustainability and ultimate      contribution of DHMIS in the management of the district health system (DHS) in      Kenya. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken in three      DHSs in Kenya. Empirical evidence was collected through interviews, complemented       by a comprehensive review of relevant literature, reports and operational manuals      of various health information systems in Kenya. RESULTS: A set of evaluation      criteria for DHMISs in Kenya was designed for each of the three phases of      implementation: phase one-pre-implementation evaluation criteria (categorized as       policy and objectives, technical feasibility, financial viability, political      viability and administrative operability) to be applied at the design stage;      phase two-concurrent (operational) implementation evaluation criteria to be      applied during implementation of the new system; phase three-post-implementation       evaluation criteria (classified as internal-quality of information;      external-resources and managerial support; ultimate-systems impact) to be applied      after operating the implemented system for at least 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: In      designing a DHMIS model there is need to have built-in these three sets of      evaluation criteria which should be used in a phased manner. Pre-implementation      evaluation criteria should be used to evaluate the system's viability before more      resources are committed to its implementation; concurrent (operational)      implementation evaluation criteria should be used to ascertain the status of the       on-going implementation with the view to either fine-tune or abandon it      altogether before more resources are used on it; and post-implementation      evaluation criteria should be used to assess its overall effectiveness (if it has      achieved its hypothesized benefits) towards the management of DHS.

PMID- 15626633   - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess patients' willingness to       use e-mail to obtain specific test results, assess their expectations regarding      response times, and identify any demographic trends. METHODS: A cross-sectional      survey of primary care patients was conducted in 19 clinics of a large      multi-specialty group practice associated with an 186,000-member Health      Maintenance Organization. The outcome measures were proportion of patients with      current e-mail access, their willingness to use it for selected general clinical       services and to obtain specific test results, and their expectations of      timeliness of response. RESULTS: The majority of patients (58.3%) reported having      current e-mail access and indicated strong willingness to use it for     communication. However, only 5.8% reported having ever used it to communicate      with their physician. Patients were most willing to use e-mail to obtain      cholesterol and blood sugar test results, but less willing to use it to obtain      brain CT scan results. Patients' expectations of timeliness were generally very      high, particularly for high-stakes tests such as brain CT scan. Significant      differences of willingness and expectations were found by age group, education,      and income. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that most patients are willing      to use e-mail to communicate with their primary care providers even for specific       test results and that patients will hold providers to high standards of      timeliness regarding response. The implication is that integration of e-mail      communications into primary care ought to assure prompt and accurate patient      access to a plethora of specific clinical services.

PMID- 15626632   - OBJECTIVE: To find and assess quality-rating instruments that can be used by      health care consumers to assess websites displaying health information. DATA      SOURCES: Searches of PubMed, the World Wide Web (using five different search      engines), reference tracing from identified articles, and a review of the of the       American Medical Informatics Association's annual symposium proceedings. REVIEW      METHODS: Sources were examined for availability, number of elements, objectivity,      and readability. RESULTS: A total of 273 distinct instruments were found and      analyzed. Of these, 80 (29%) made evaluation criteria publicly available and 24      (8.7%) had 10 or fewer elements (items that a user has to assess to evaluate a      website). Seven instruments consisted of elements that could all be evaluated      objectively. Of these seven, one instrument consisted entirely of criteria with      acceptable interobserver reliability (kappa> or =0.6); another instrument met      readability standards. CONCLUSIONS: There are many quality-rating instruments,      but few are likely to be practically usable by the intended audience.

PMID- 15626631   - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have many unanswered questions during clinical encounters       which may impact on the quality and outcomes of decisions made. Provision of      online evidence at the point of care is one strategy that provides clinicians      with easy access to up-to-date evidence in clinical settings to support      evidence-based decision-making. AIM: To determine if and when general      practitioners use an online evidence system in routine clinical practice, the      type of questions for which clinicians seek evidence and the extent to which the       system provides clinically useful answers. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective cohort       study which involved a 4-week clinical trial of Quick Clinical, an online      evidence system specifically designed around the needs of general practitioners.       SETTING: Two hundred and twenty-seven clinicians who had a computer with Internet      access in their consulting rooms. METHODS: Computer logs and survey analysis.      RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three general practitioners used the online      evidence system to conduct on average 8.7 searches/month. The majority of these      (81%) were conducted from consulting rooms and carried out between 9a.m. and      7p.m. (83%). The most frequent searches conducted related to diagnosis (40%) and       treatment (35%). 83% of clinicians believed that Quick Clinical (QC) had the      potential to improve patient care, and one in four users reported direct      experience of improvements in care. In 73% of queries with clinician feedback      participants reported that they were able to find clinically useful information      during their routine work. CONCLUSION: General practitioners will use an online      evidence retrieval system in routine practice, and report that its use improves      the quality of patient care.

PMID- 15491931   - All over the world, countries more and more take part in the international      society and economy. To meet the stringent requirements of this globalization      asks for internationally oriented and well-educated graduates. A major challenge       of academia thus lies in qualifying graduates for international positions in this      new world. A crucial element in the training and education of tomorrow's medical       informatics specialists is exposure to health care systems across national      borders. In this contribution, we report on the international aspects of and      experiences with an inter-university course for medical informatics students on      hospital information systems, in particular on their strategic information      management. From 2001 onwards, this course was offered jointly for students of      the University of Amsterdam, the University of Heidelberg/University of Applied      Sciences Heilbronn and the University of Health Informatics and Technology, Tyrol      (UMIT). Based on our experiences, future establishment of international courses      in the medical and health informatics field is recommended.

PMID- 15491930   - PURPOSE: This survey among an interdisciplinary group of clinicians was conducted      to obtain their opinions about the usefulness of decision support systems (DSS)      for evidence- and patient preference-based illness management, factors important       to their implementation, and criteria for evaluating their effectiveness.      METHODS: A questionnaire was sent by mail or electronically to a convenience      sample of 184 nurses, physicians and other health care professionals. RESULTS:      The DSS ability to provide information about potential benefits and harms of      intervention options and reports on patient outcomes of symptom relief,      functional status and preference achievement was considered most useful among DSS      features. Nurses rated the usefulness of the DSS higher than physicians did. Ease      of use, no increase in workload, and timely, precise information were rated as      the most important factors for successful implementation. The most frequently      selected patient, care process/provider and system outcomes rated as indicators      for DSS effectiveness were: patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life,      symptom relief, functional status, and alignment of patient preferences with      realistic expectations; congruence between patient preferences and patient care;       clinician time use; quality of patient documentation and cost-effectiveness.      CONCLUSION: This survey provided crucial information to successfully develop DSS       for evidence- and patient preference-based illness management that are perceived       helpful by their potential users.

PMID- 15491929   - OBJECTIVES: Clinical use of computer systems has been hampered by their poorly      designed user interfaces. The objective of this study was to design a user     interface for a pediatric oncologists' computerized patient record with great      consideration of their working behavior and of human computer interfacing      principles so as to contribute to oncologists' efficiency and satisfaction in      interaction with the system. METHODS: The think aloud method was used in      combination with video recording to get a deep understanding of the way in which       four pediatric oncologists searched through the paper-based patient record in      preparing a patient visit. Protocol and video analyses was used to develop a      cognitive task model reflecting pediatric oncologists' task behavior. This model       was input for a prototype user interface, which was subsequently evaluated by      eight other pediatric oncologists. RESULTS: The resulting computerized medical      record system proved to meet pediatric oncologists' information needs and task      behavior patterns. The design of the user interface minimized pediatric      oncologists' work load and was highly efficient in supporting the pediatric      oncologists in preparing their patient visits. The pediatric oncologists were      very much satisfied with the computer system. CONCLUSIONS: It is argued that      early involvement of cognitive engineering methods in the system design process      may be of great help in designing systems that fully support health care      professionals' work practices. The think aloud method, if applied under     prescribed conditions, is a valuable information source of human task-behavior     and as such a useful technique for requirements analysis in designing clinical      computer systems.

PMID- 15491928   - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to use a heuristic evaluation      methodology to uncover design and interface deficiencies of infusion pumps that      are currently in use in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Because these infusion      systems cannot be readily replaced due to lease agreements and large-scale      institutional purchasing procedures, we argue that it is essential to      systematically identify the existing usability problems so that the possible      causes of errors can be better understood, passed on to the end-users (e.g.,      critical care nurses), and used to make policy recommendations. DESIGN: Four     raters conducted the heuristic evaluation of the three-channel infusion pump      interface. Three raters had a cognitive science background as well as experience       with the heuristic evaluation methodology. The fourth rater was a veteran      critical care nurse who had extensive experience operating the pumps. The      usability experts and the domain expert independently evaluated the user     interface and physical design of the infusion pump and generated a list of      heuristic violations based upon a set of 14 heuristics developed in previous      research. The lists were compiled and then rated on the severity of the      violation. RESULTS: From 14 usability heuristics considered in this evaluation of      the Infusion Pump, there were 231 violations. Two heuristics, "Consistency" and      "Language", were found to have the most violations. The one with fewest      violations was "Document". While some heuristic evaluation categories had more      violations than others, the most severe ones were not confined to one type. The      Primary interface location (e.g., where loading the pump, changing doses, and      confirming drug settings takes place) had the most occurrences of heuristic      violations. CONCLUSION: We believe that the Heuristic Evaluation methodology      provides a simple and cost-effective approach to discovering medical device      deficiencies that affect a patient's general well being. While this methodology      provides information for the infusion pump designs of the future, it also      identifies important insights concerning equipment that is currently in use in      critical care environments.

PMID- 15491926   - PURPOSE: The aim of this project was to design and evaluate a system that would      produce tailored information for stroke patients and their carers, customised      according to their informational needs, and facilitate communication between the       patient and health professional. METHOD: A human factors development approach was      used to develop a computer system, which dynamically compiles stroke education      booklets for patients and carers. Patients and carers are able to select the      topics about which they wish to receive information, the amount of information      they want, and the font size of the printed booklet. The system is designed so      that the health professional interacts with it, thereby providing opportunities      for communication between the health professional and patient/carer at a number     of points in time. RESULTS: Preliminary evaluation of the system by health      professionals, patients and carers was positive. A randomised controlled trial      that examines the effect of the system on patient and carer outcomes is underway.

PMID- 15491925   - BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis carinii is the leading opportunistic pulmonary infection      in HIV-infected patients. Invasive diagnostic procedures might be avoided if      available electronic data can accurately identify patients with Pneumocystis      pneumonia (PCP). METHODS: We extracted data from electronic hospital records,      emergency department records, and a pathology database for 299 HIV-infected      patients with pneumonia who underwent bronchoscopy. We identified independent      indicators of confirmed PCP using logistic regression analysis on a random half      of the patients and validated the predictive power of the resulting model on the       other half. RESULTS: Bronchoscopy confirmed pneumocystis carinii in 111 patients       (37%). Five of the seven significant independent predictors of PCP came from      patients' electronic medical records: infiltrate on chest radiograph, male      gender, lower red cell distribution width, lower serum creatinine, and a prior     positive HIV test. The other two (duration of illness and presence of dyspnea)      came from the emergency department record. A simple index found 43% of patients      at low risk (18% with pneumocystis), 37% at moderate risk (36% with      pneumocystis), and 20% at high risk (74% with pneumocystis). CONCLUSIONS: Data      from electronic medical records can help quantify the risk of PCP among      HIV-infected patients. However, the model failed to identify 18% of patients with      PCP in the low risk group, and empiric therapy would erroneously treat 26% of      patients classified as high risk. Bronchoscopy is needed to accurately diagnose      PCP among HIV-infected patients with pneumonia. However, if bronchoscopy is not      available, the model can help with initial decisions about antibiotic therapy.

PMID- 15325330   - In order to increase the number of practical and discussion classes offered to      students in the traditional-curriculum scenario, while decreasing the      lecture-based ones and to create an online community to share knowledge on      surgery, we developed and assessed the first online course for undergraduate      medical students on experimental surgery at the Federal University of Sao      Paulo-UNIFESP, Brazil. The purposes of the present study are: describe and      discuss the process and the lessons learned involved in developing an      undergraduate web-based course and analyze the students' attitude towards this      educational environment. A group of medical students was taught online during 5      weeks on the theory of experimental surgery through video quizzes, required      readings, collaborative activities using discussion board and asynchronous      communication. The students' knowledge gain, their web session variables and the       results of the course evaluation were used to support our study. The students      have significantly improved their knowledge on experimental surgery after the      course. Among factors in the online course that could possibly have contributed      to this gain, the interactive activities (video quizzes), key element in our     online material, seemed to be promising for candidates. The evaluation results      demonstrated high levels of course functionality, effectiveness of its online      content and acceptance among medical students. This study indicated that a      web-based course for undergraduate students may be successfully developed and      implemented in medical settings and the students seem to be quite supportive. We       encourage undergraduate medical learning strategies involving the Web.

PMID- 15325329   - OBJECTIVES: To (1) discover the types of errors most commonly found in clinical      notes that are generated either using automatic speech recognition (ASR) or via      human transcription and (2) to develop efficient rules for classifying these      errors based on the categories found in (1). The purpose of classifying errors      into categories is to understand the underlying processes that generate these      errors, so that measures can be taken to improve these processes. METHODS: We      integrated the Dragon NaturallySpeaking v4.0 speech recognition engine into the      Regenstrief Medical Record System. We captured the text output of the speech      engine prior to error correction by the speaker. We also acquired a set of human       transcribed but uncorrected notes for comparison. We then attempted to error     correct these notes based on looking at the context alone. Initially, three      domain experts independently examined 104 ASR notes (containing 29,144 words)      generated by a single speaker and 44 human transcribed notes (containing 14,199      words) generated by multiple speakers for errors. Collaborative group sessions      were subsequently held where error categorizes were determined and rules      developed and incrementally refined for systematically examining the notes and      classifying errors. RESULTS: We found that the errors could be classified into      nine categories: (1) announciation errors occurring due to speaker     mispronounciation, (2) dictionary errors resulting from missing terms, (3) suffix      errors caused by misrecognition of appropriate tenses of a word, (4) added words,      (5) deleted words, (6) homonym errors resulting from substitution of a      phonetically identical word, (7) spelling errors, (8) nonsense errors,      words/phrases whose meaning could not be appreciated by examining just the      context, and (9) critical errors, words/phrases where a reader of a note could      potentially misunderstand the concept that was related by the speaker.      CONCLUSIONS: A simple method is presented for examining errors in transcribed      documents and classifying these errors into meaningful and useful categories.      Such a classification can potentially help pinpoint sources of such errors so      that measures (such as better training of the speaker and improved dictionary and      language modeling) can be taken to optimize the error rates.

PMID- 15325328   - OBJECTIVE: There is a worldwide consensus to use the diagnosis related groups      (DRG) to consider hospital activity. This tool leads to the production of tables       with numbers (case mix), the interpretation of which is difficult. The issue is      to translate these tables of numbers into an image named Case view. METHOD: It      assimilates, in a way, each DRG to a "pixel", the set of the DRGs being an image,      the case view. The methods consist of two phases: the first one is to define the       reference set while the second one is to visualize data through the reference      set. The "DRG-pixels" which constitute the reference set should be organized      according to three criteria: medical/surgical, nosological and economic. RESULTS:      This method is used to answer theoretical questions or to visualize activity at      the level of a hospital or at the level of a department. It generates information      of synthetic nature and ought to be used as a complement to existing methods.      DISCUSSION: An important advantage of this method compared to the existing ones      (DRGs listing, DRGs clustering, histograms em leader ) is that it presents data      simultaneously at a global level (sets of DRGs) and at a local level (the DRG).      CONCLUSION: We hope this method to be a supplementary step toward the creation of      tools capable of eliciting the semantic content hidden in the medical data banks.      The purpose of this paper is to explain the underlying general principles that      define the graphic representation and to illustrate this model with the use of      the French reference set.

PMID- 15325327   - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of an automated test ordering and feedback system       (named GRIF) in daily practice. The system produces recommendations to general      practitioners (GPs) to improve the application of accepted practice guidelines      for test ordering. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with balanced block      design was carried out in general practices in two regions of the Netherlands      from August 2000 to July 2001. We implemented the GRIF system on the workstations      at the offices of the participating GPs. The GPs (n=11) were asked to use GRIF      during patient consultation instead of filling in the paper request form. The      system displayed critical comments about their non-adherence to the guidelines as      apparent from the request forms. RESULTS: The median time of producing the      comments plus the response time of the GP was 13s. Of the 2780 presented      recommendations, 4.3% were accepted. Advice of the GRIF system that presents a      concrete test to request in a particular situation is adhered to most frequently.      Finally, there seems to be a decrease of accepted comments over the trial period.      CONCLUSION: Computerised recommendations should contain, if possible, suggestions      for alternative tests to improve the application of these recommendations.      Furthermore, creative solutions must be developed to avoid that GPs get used to      the recommendations of critiquing systems and to stimulate a better adherence to       these recommendations.

PMID- 15325326   - OBJECTIVES: To apply and evaluate the effects of a program for computer generated      physician reminders, integrated with an electronic patient record (EPR) system,      for opportunistic health screening in elderly patients. DESIGN: A pilot study      designed as a 20-month clinical trial with a control group and a 20-month      non-intervention follow-up using a computer reminder program that selects      patients for screening in five intervention areas (diabetes, hypertension,      cobalamin deficiency, hypothyroidism and anaemia). SETTING: Four primary health      care (PHC) centres in suburban Stockholm. SUBJECTS: The intervention was designed      for patients 70 years or older from one health care centre who visited a general       practitioner (GP) during the first 20-month period. Patients from the three      remaining centres served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of      patients who underwent the tests, who had pathological test results, new      diagnoses and new pharmacological treatments in both patient groups. RESULTS: In       total, 602 patients underwent screening and 1989 were controls. There was a      statistically significant, moderate or marked increase (13-75%) in the number of       patients who were tested in all five intervention areas. An increase in      pathological test results (1-8%) was found in two areas: hypertension and      cobalamin deficiency. There was an increase in the number of patients with the      diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency during the study. At follow-up a decrease in      new diagnoses for anaemia was found. CONCLUSION: The system seems to be      associated with a moderate to large increase in laboratory and manual screening      tests for both established and new screening areas. The effect on clinical      outcomes was found mainly in a not-yet-established screening area (cobalamin      deficiency), indicating that the system may be clinically useful when introducing      new screening services.

PMID- 15325325   - PURPOSE: The web, a widely accessed medium for patients to obtain health      information, has special relevance for patients with diabetes. This paper     critiques the publicly available web sites for diabetes, and it establishes      criteria for excellence in these sites. METHODS: A web search for diabetes      mellitus based on Google, Yahoo, and the directory Mendosa provided the basis for     the study. We defined and evaluated three major categories for each site:      usability, content, and reliability. Usability was defined by design, ease of      navigation, interactivity, and internal search capability. Content was based on      the quality of general information about diabetes, discussions about monitoring      blood glucose, meal planning, exercise, complications, medications, alternative      therapies, resources, and support systems. Reliability was defined by the      presence of the HON code, identification of an author, and the availability of      experts. RESULTS: The focused Mendosa search produced 47 web sites. The majority       were published by commercial organizations. Five sites were found to have the      best usability. Other sites were cluttered or inundated with distracting      information from advertisements. Content was generally excellent but limited by      an absence of specific advice and information about controlling associated risk      factors for cardiovascular disease. Only 17% of sites met all criteria for     reliability. The sites that best met the criteria for quality were the American      Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) and the Joslin Diabetes Center     (www.joslin.org). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large numbers of publicly available      web sites for diabetes, only a few met criteria for quality. The physician's      input and ongoing evaluation of these quality measures are essential to assure      that patients get meaningful and relevant information from the web about managing      diabetes.

PMID- 15325324   - Infectious diseases pose a great danger to public health internationally. The      outbreak of SARS has exposed China's fragile public health system and its limited      ability to detect and respond to emergencies in a timely and effective manner. In      order to strengthen its capability of responding to future public health      emergencies, China is developing a public health emergency response information      system (PHERIS) to facilitate disease surveillance, detection, reporting, and      response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ongoing development of       China's PHERIS. This paper analyzes the problems of China's existing public      health system and describes the design and functionalities of PHERIS from both      technical and managerial aspects.

PMID- 15325323   - Computer-based software to record histories, physical exams, and progress or     procedure notes, known as computer-based documentation (CBD) software, has been      touted as an important addition to the electronic health record. The      functionality of CBD systems has remained static over the past 30 years, which      may have contributed to the limited adoption of these tools. Early users of this       technology, who have tried multiple products, may have insight into important      features to be considered in next-generation CBD systems. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS:       We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of the clinical working group      membership of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) to generate a      set of features that might improve adoption of next-generation systems. The study      was conducted online over a 4-month period; 57% of the working group members      completed the survey. RESULTS: As anticipated, CBD tool use was higher (53%) in      this population than in the US physician offices. The most common methods of data      entry employed keyboard and mouse, with agreement that these modalities worked      well. Many respondents had experience with pre-printed data collection forms      before interacting with a CBD system. Respondents noted that CBD improved their     ability to document large amounts of information, allowed timely sharing of      information, enhanced patient care, and enhanced medical information with other     clinicians (all P < 0.001). Respondents also noted some important but absent      features in CBD, including the ability to add images, get help, and generate      billing information. CONCLUSIONS: The latest generation of CBD systems is being      used successfully by early adopters, who find that these tools confer many      advantages over the approaches to documentation that they replaced. These users      provide insights that may improve successive generations of CBD tools. Additional      surveys of CBD non-users and failed adopters will be necessary to provide other     useful insights that can address barriers to the adoption of CBD by less computer     literate physicians.

PMID- 15246046   - Measures of functional levels, commonly used to assess the safety and quality of       life of individuals and populations, have not yet been derived from a fuzzy      framework. The aim of this study is to estimate the degree of disability      associated with varying functional levels, through a model based on fuzzy sets      theory. A fuzzy linguistic model was developed to measure varying levels of      functional disability, in accordance with the definitions of an individual's      social and physical activities and mobility. One year of an adult's life whose      mobility, social and physical activities were somewhat limited, was judged to be       equivalent to 0.575 years free of functional disability. Results obtained from      the fuzzy model approach those obtained with the quality of well-being scale      (QWB), used as a conceptual framework. Such findings are encouraging, since the      QWB is considered a consistent and valid approach for disability assessment and      quality-of-life evaluation.

PMID- 15246045   - A computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system can provide an efficient means       of retrieving and consolidating order lists from multiple electronic clinical      practice standards and protocols. However, the consolidated order list may      contain exact duplicate or overlapping orders. Benner's framework for levels of      nursing expertise can be used to explicate the variability of the nurse's      responses to redundancies in order lists and the potential compromise to patient       safety. An exploratory case method was performed to consolidate 74 orders from 11      sources. The consolidated order list contained 35% fewer orders after the      redundant orders were removed. Our work has shown that many redundant orders may       arise by consolidating order lists from multiple electronic standards. It is      imperative that consolidated electronic order lists be manageable by the nurse      according to their level of clinical and computer expertise, and that redundant      orders are resolved before being displayed to the nurse.

PMID- 15246044   - Evidence suggests that inadequate access to information and ineffective      communication are proximal causes of errors and other adverse events in-patient      care. Within the context of reducing these proximal causes of errors, we explore       the use of novel information-based approaches to improve information access and      communication in health care settings. This paper describes the approaches for     and the design of extensions to a clinical information system used to improve      information access and communication at the point of care using information-based      handheld wireless applications. These extensions include clinical and information      resources, event monitoring, and a virtual whiteboard (VWB).

PMID- 15246043   - AIM: Develop a compositional terminology model for nursing orders that would      conform to the existing standard health level seven (HL7) messaging standard for       clinical orders. Develop and evaluate the set of attributes needed for a      pre-coordinated concept for a single nursing order, using a replicable three-step      modeling process. RESULTS: A terminology model for nursing orders was developed      using empirical data. The model was validated against nursing research and      standards literature, and evaluated using 609 nursing orders that were      successfully mapped to the structure. The representative services came from 20      Intermountain Health Care (IHC) hospitals, demonstrating the generalizability of       the model and its attributes across many care settings.

PMID- 15246042   - AIM: Establish an organizational infrastructure to foster the delivery of quality      clinical care through the development of interdisciplinary patient care standards      that are evidenced-based and consistent throughout IHC. DESIGN: Develop a process      for document development, review, and approval that includes best evidence from      research and input from clinical experts. RESULTS: After six years of      development, the electronic reference InfoBase (a searchable online reference      manual which provides easy access to standards for clinical practice throughout      the organization) contains over 700 interdisciplinary patient care standards      (e.g., protocols, procedures, standards of care) and over 1000 "information      chunks" (e.g., assessments, instructions, scales, tables, graphics) that support       consistency in care delivery. All documents have been written, based on the best       evidence available from research and reviewed by a group of clinicians at IHC      facilities and approved for use throughout the company. An example of how      standardization of interdisciplinary standards can improve patient safety in the       area of falls is also included.

PMID- 15246041   - When people become patients, they place their trust in their health care      providers. As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment,       patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their     safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make       it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may      prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in       this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and      health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority.      Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and      delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving      safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an      international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and      discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.

PMID- 15246040   - One of the fundamental rights of patients is to have their privacy protected by      health care organizations, so that information that can be used to identify a      particular individual is not used to reveal sensitive patient data such as      diagnoses, reasons for ordering tests, test results, etc. A common practice is to      remove sensitive data from databases that are disseminated to the public, but      this can make the disseminated database useless for important public health      purposes. If the degree of anonymity of a disseminated data set could be      measured, it would be possible to design algorithms that can assure that the      desired level of confidentiality is achieved. Privacy protection in disseminated       databases can be facilitated by the use of special ambiguation algorithms. Most      of these algorithms are aimed at making one individual indistinguishable from one      or more of his peers. However, even in databases considered "anonymous", it may      still be possible to obtain sensitive information about some individuals or     groups of individuals with the use of pattern recognition algorithms. In this      article, we study the problem of determining the degree of ambiguation in      disseminated databases and discuss its implications in the development and      testing of "anonymization" algorithms.

PMID- 15246039   - Redefinition of roles and functions in the healthcare systems of the future      requires embracing to the value of continuing education. Within this framework      healthcare professional education and continuing education, there are several      core competencies described by Institute of Medicine (IOM) [A.C. Greiner, E.      Knebel (Eds.), Health Professionals Education: Bridge to Quality, IOM, available       at, May 2003] that form the foundation for practice for nurses and other     healthcare professionals. An overarching sentence in the document says "All      health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as      members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice,      quality improvement approaches, and informatics" (p. 45). These IOM core      competencies are: (1) Common value for respecting patients' differences, values,       preferences and expressed needs. (2) Ability to cooperate, collaborate,      communicate and integrate care using interdisciplinary teams. (3) Knowledge of      and willingness to employ evidence-based practice principles. (4) Capability to      apply quality and safety improvement approaches in care. (5) Understand, value      and use informatics to all areas of health care, to reduce errors, manage      knowledge and information, and make decisions and communicate. In enveloping      these core competencies in basic and continuing education, it is necessary to      build an evidence base for education itself, demand that faculty are prepared for     the future. A crucial need is for healthcare professional students (including      nursing students) learn interdisciplinary collaboration in the education of      patients. A global strategy, using these competencies for preparing faculty is      necessary; and some models already exist that can be further developed to meet      future needs that are informatics driven in our increasingly technological future      care systems.

PMID- 15246038   - The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in America      identified the critical role of information technology in designing safe and      effective health care. In addition to technical aspects such as regional or     national health information infrastructures, to achieve this goal, healthcare      professionals must receive the requisite training during basic and advanced      educational programs. In this article, we describe a two-pronged strategy to      promote patient safety through an informatics-based approach to nursing education      at the Columbia University School of Nursing: (1) use of a personal digital      assistant (PDA) to document clinical encounters and to retrieve patient      safety-related information at the point of care, and (2) enhancement of      informatics competencies of students and faculty. These approaches may be useful       to others wishing to promote patient safety through using informatics methods and      technologies in healthcare curricula.

PMID- 15246037   - The purpose of this paper is to identify the information that nurses in hospitals      exchange with nurses in home health care (HHC), and what nurses perceive to be      the most significant information to exchange. METHOD: Nurses have an obligation      to support and ensure continuity of patient care and to prevent an information      gap when patients are transferred from one organizational of health care delivery      to another organizational level, for example, from hospital to home health care.       In an ongoing prospective study, nurses' pre-electronic nursing discharge note      and their assessment of the information it was necessary to exchange at the same       time was audited and analyzed. The results show variation in the completeness and      content of the nursing discharge note. Nurses' understanding of the scope and      content of information to be transmitted varies widely according to the context      and the organizational health care level they work within. The implementation of       an electronic nursing discharge note creates the opportunity to identify the      accurate information elements that must be documented and exchanged between the      nurses to ensure patient safety and inter-organizational continuity of care.

PMID- 15246036   - The science development and technology application improvement in all areas of      knowledge, including health care, represent an advance in patient care. The      health care providers face challenges to accomplish complex procedures and      treatments, which demand infrastructure, defined framework, constant process      establishment and redesign of nursing care, based on a continuous outcomes      evaluation. Therefore, this development requires nurses with advanced knowledge      and skills. As the main health care provider in Brazilian hospitals, the nursing       staff perform and control the majority of direct patient care procedures, and as       such, nursing professionals can be responsible for triggering adverse events that      can compromise patient safety. Research conducted in Brazil showed that the      quality of health care delivery system and the results of care have significant      variation nationwide. Health care professionals should be valued as the one who      can promote patient safety, providing high quality care within cost-effective      services. Technology is a key element to support and enhance the professional's      performance. However, it is also important to promote and facilitate its      implementation and development to retain a creative, engaged, skilled, satisfied,      competent, and accountable professional capable of identifying and using      technology resources in order to assure the quality of care for the population.

PMID- 15246035   - The Institute of Medicine's landmark report asserted that medical error is seldom      the fault of individuals, but the result of faulty healthcare policy/procedure      systems. Numerous studies have shown that information technology (IT) can shore      up weak systems. For nursing, IT plays a key role in eliminating nursing      mistakes. However, managing IT is a function of managing the people who use it.      For nursing administrators, successful IT implementations depend on adroit      management of the three 'P's: People, processes and (computer) programs. This      paper examines critical issues for managing each entity. It discusses the      importance of developing trusting organizations, the requirements of process      change, how to implement technology in harmony with the organization and the      significance of vision.

PMID- 15246034   - This paper describes how informatics tools can support shared decision making and      risk communication and thereby play an important role in enhancing patient      safety. Using preference elicitation techniques and knowledge on risk      communication, such tools can help patients understand their treatment options      and associated short- and long-term benefits and risks, assist in the elicitation      of patient preferences, and help patients and clinicians in making treatment      choices with the highest likelihood of achieving desired patient outcomes.      Important features of such tools are proposed, including: (1) Interactive      tutorials to improve risk comprehension and prepare patients and clinicians for     the decision making task; (2) choices between different presentation modes to      meet patients' individual reading levels and presentation preferences; (3) risk      calculations that account for individual risk profiles; (4) performance of      necessary calculations to reach the actual decision; (5) automatic updates of      evidence; and (6) the use of different preference-elicitation techniques.

PMID- 15246033   - Patients appear in the patient safety agenda in three important places: first and      foremost as the individual most likely to experience the positive benefits of      good care or negative consequences of unsafe care; second, as surveyors of      quality of care indicators; and finally, through their presence as patient      representatives on institutional safety committees. However, patient safety      programs largely address provider-interests, and many times overlook patient      preferences and needs. Active engagement of the patient in all aspects of the      patient safety agenda is necessary for its success. Patient safety, then,      requires: a comprehensive agenda informed by patient preferences and experiences;      an informed and motivated populace; mechanisms integrate safe practices and      patient preferences, and investment in safety-enhancing devices and care      strategies.

PMID- 15171987   - In high-critical medical fields instant information delivery is essential.      Task-flow analyses within the transplantation unit of the Technische Universitat       Munchen revealed that valuable time could be saved in pre-transplantation      management being able to retrieve data of organ receivers ubiquitously. Inspired       by this clinical scenario, a mobile application was designed and implemented      providing surgeons with decision-relevant information on potential organ      receivers. It assists them in considering the prospects of forthcoming organ      transplantations and facilitates decision making and documentation with regard to      high security demands. The described system services three organ receiver lists      and is used by the surgeons in every transplantation procedure. After a 6-month      period of clinical usage, the system has been evaluated in terms of handling,      clinical benefit and total time savings. Intuitive, ubiquitous access to      decision-relevant patient data and authenticated documentation were the major     improvements with average total time savings of 50 min in comparison to the old      system.

PMID- 15171986   - INTRODUCTION: We developed a computerized antimicrobial guidance program based on      the last 5 years of our laboratory culture data augmented by expert infectious      disease logic. The program is designed to assist physicians with the targeting of      empiric antimicrobials for hospitalized patients by tracking pathogenic bacteria       and their evolving antimicrobial resistance profiles. Costs, toxicities, and      environmental impact of antimicrobial use also influence the final      recommendations. We undertook the following analysis to verify its potential      safety and efficacy in hospitalized patients with a bloodstream infection.      METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled all inpatients with a positive blood culture      for a previously undetermined pathogen during the first 6 months of 2002 and      determined the empiric therapy initiated within the 12h before and after the time      of culture. Antimicrobial recommendations from the microbiologic decision support      tool were then determined by matching specimen (blood), hospital unit, community-      versus hospital-acquired category, age category, and gender. Generated      antimicrobial recommendations were tailored to patient allergies, age category,      and presence of pregnancy, lactation, or hepatic impairment. RESULTS: The      microbiology laboratory recorded 226 unique patient/pathogen blood cultures      during the study period. Physicians initiated effective empiric therapy in 150 of      the 226 cases, for an effectiveness rate of 66%. The computer-guided therapy was       effective in 195 of the 226 cases for a rate of 86%. A contingency table analysis      showed 55 cases where the computer recommendation was effective but the      physicians' selection was not, and eight cases where the physicians'      antimicrobials were effective but the computer's were not (P < 0.0001).      DISCUSSION: For patients with a bloodstream infection, we found that our     computer-guided statistically-derived antimicrobial therapy would potentially      improve the rate of effectiveness of empirically chosen antimicrobials.

PMID- 15171985   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care databases form a unique source of      population-based clinical information on the prevalence and management of      diagnosed disorders. Historically such databases have lacked individual level      socio-economic markers. We describe the development of the Doctors' Independent      Network (DIN) database for epidemiological and health services research. DIN      includes a socio-economic marker (ACORN) based on postcode linkage at individual       patient level. The validity of DIN is assessed against the General Practice      Research Database (GPRD). METHODS: External validity is assessed by comparing the      demographic structure and prevalence rates for treated ischemic heart disease      (IHD) and treated hay fever with those from the GPRD. We assess the utility of a       socio-economic measure (ACORN) based on postcode-linkage at individual patient      level by examining the trend in prevalence rates of IHD and hay fever by ACORN      index. RESULTS: 142 practices providing high quality data were selected, with      1827361 fully registered patients contributing data between 1992 and 2001,      representing an identical age-sex structure to that for England & Wales and GPRD.      Regionally adjusted prevalence of treated IHD (7.29 and 5.37%, respectively for     men and women aged 35+ in 1998) in DIN was highly comparable to GPRD (7.27 and      5.42%). In DIN, the odds ratio of IHD was 1.37 (95% CI 1.30-1.44) in subjects      living in "striving" compared to "thriving" areas. The prevalence of treated hay       fever prevalence was similar across databases, with inverse associations seen      with ACORN in DIN (higher rates in "thriving" areas). CONCLUSIONS: DIN provides      comparable period prevalence rates to GPRD for two common conditions, with social      trends as expected. Primary care databases such as these have the potential to      replace the decennial national morbidity surveys carried out in UK general      practices, with DIN having the important advantage of including a socio-economic       index.

PMID- 15171984   - Computerized provider order entry systems can improve patient care by integrating      clinical decision support. Decision support is most effective when its content      and delivery are acceptable. The authors report the results of a multifaceted      survey of the attitudes of housestaff and medical student users of a provider     order entry system with integrated decision support at an academic medical      center. The survey contained 16 items covering four themes: efficiency, quality      of care, results reporting and embedded guidelines. Responses were captured using      a five point Likert scale, and were compared using ANOVA and Bartlett's testing.       Out of 491 housestaff and 128 medical students, response rates were 47 and 29%,      respectively. Among respondents, 72% agreed or strongly agreed that the provider       order entry system improves the quality of care that they provide, 54% that the      decision support usually help them to provide quality patient care, and 62% that       it improves the efficiency of order entry. Respondents were least likely to agree      that the display of prior laboratory results influenced their decision to order a      subsequent test. There were no significant differences between subspecialties and      by advancing years of training among housestaff. Respondents agreed that the      integrated clinical decision support enhanced their medical training.

PMID- 15171983   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We performed a follow-up survey to document changes in      the level of computerization among physicians in Hong Kong between 2000 and 2001,      specifically examining whether their self-reported intention to computerize      various clinical or administrative tasks actually translated into computerization      of these tasks 1 year later. Determining such a relationship will indicate the      reliability, and thus the utility of questions regarding self-reported intention       to computerize clinical practice. METHODS: A self-completed follow-up postal      questionnaire was sent to all 949 physicians who responded to the original      questionnaire. Pairwise repeated dichotomous responses from 2000 and 2001 on the       computerization of specific functions were compared using McNemar test. Wilcoxon       sign-ranked test was employed to compare the total number of tasks computerized      in the 2 years. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was carried out to      determine predictors for the translation of intention to computerize into actual       computerization. RESULTS: The response rate was 77.0%. There was a significant      increase in the number of tasks computerized for both "corporate" and      "individual" practices between 2000 and 2001. The proportion of physicians who      intended to computerize and actually computerized ranged from 7.7 to 51.0% for     different tasks. For five clinical tasks, more than 50% respondents in corporate       practices translated the intention to implementation, compared to fewer than 20%       in individual practices. Predictors found to be associated with the translation      of intention to computerize into actual computerization included higher number of      tasks intended to computerize, higher number of tasks already computerized, and      more positive physicians' attitudes on the impact of computerization to clinical       practice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that physicians' self-reported intention to      computerize the clinical practice 12 months previously was moderately associated       with actual implementation, with varying degrees of concordance for different      clinical and administrative tasks. The identified predictors for the translation       of intention to actual computerization may be useful in targeting specific      strategies to promote computerization of clinical practice.

PMID- 15171982   - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We evaluated factors associated with physicians'      perceptions towards the effects of computers on health care and on current levels      of computerization in their practice. We also performed a contingent valuation to      quantify physicians' perceived benefits from computerization in a hypothetical      ambulatory, solo clinic. METHODS: We surveyed 949 representative physicians in      Hong Kong by post. Factor analysis was performed to summarize similar items into       categories. Multivariable log-linear regression models were employed to assess      the relationships between different factor scores and the number of functions      computerized. We elicited their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for three defined      computer systems using contingent valuation techniques. WTP values were estimated      using econometric modeling by both, parametric and geometric methods.      Sociodemographic, attitudinal, and practice-related predictors of WTP were      estimated through regression analyses. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed a      three-factor solution which explained 53% of total variance. The overall mean      score (mean = 3.51 +/- 0.45) showed a generally positive attitude towards the      effects of computers on health care. Respondents with a higher level of computer       knowledge had significantly higher mean overall (P = 0.002) and factor scores for     all three factors (P < 0.01). Higher factor scores on the effects of computers on      patient care and clinicians (P = 0.006) and on the health system (P = 0.032) were      associated with a higher number of functions computerized. The parametric median       WTP values for computerizing administrative, clinical, and both sets of functions      were HK dollars 21205 (US dollars 2719), HK dollars 34231 (US dollars 4389), and       HK dollars 45720 (US dollars 5862), respectively, which were lower than the      estimates obtained from demand curves using the geometric method [HK dollars      43286 (US dollars 5549), HK dollars 59570 (US dollars 7637), and HK dollars 84623      (US dollars 10849), respectively]. Doctors with higher incomes were willing to      pay more to computerize the clinic, with strong dose-response gradients      demonstrated. Those who worked in corporate settings were also more likely to      accept higher WTP values. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that better knowledge      about computers is contributory to a more positive attitude towards the effects      of computers on health care, which is in turn significantly associated with      higher levels of actual computerization in clinical practice. WTP values      represent the likelihood, in monetary terms, of translating doctors' perceived      benefits from computerization into investment action.

PMID- 15171981   - Speech and language therapists (SLTs) are faced daily with a diversity of speech       and language disabilities, which are associated with a variety of conditions      ranging from client groups with overall cognitive deficits to those with more      specific difficulties. It is desirable that those working with such a range of      problems and with such a demanding workload, plan care efficiently. Therefore,      the introduction of methodologies, reference models of work and tools, which      significantly improve the effectiveness of therapy, are particularly welcome.      This paper describes the first web-based tool for diagnosis, treatment and      e-Learning in the field of language and speech therapy. The system allows SLTs to      find the optimum treatment for each patient, it also allows any non-specialist      user-SLT, patient or helper (relative etc.)-to explore their creativity, by      designing their own communication aid in an interactive manner, with the use of      editors such as: configuration and vocabulary. The system has been tested and      piloted by potential users in Greece and the UK.

PMID- 15171980   - BACKGROUND: The authors have been conducting text mining analyses (extraction of       useful information from text) of Medline records, using Abstracts as the main      data source. For literature-based discovery, and other text mining applications      as well, all records in a discipline need to be evaluated for determining prior     art. Many Medline records do not contain Abstracts, but typically contain Titles       and Mesh terms. Substitution of these fields for Abstracts in the non-Abstract      records would restore the missing literature to some degree. OBJECTIVES:      Determine how well the information content of Title and Mesh fields approximates       that of Abstracts in Medline records. Approach: Select historical Medline records      related to Raynaud's Phenomenon that contain Abstracts. Determine the information      content in the Abstract fields through text mining. Then, determine the      information content in the Title fields, the Mesh fields, and the combined      Title-Mesh fields, and compare with the information content in the Abstracts.      RESULTS: Four metrics were used to compare the information content related to      Raynaud's Phenomenon in the different fields: total number of phrases; number of       unique phrases; content of factors from factor analyses; content of clusters from      multi-link clustering. The Abstract field contains almost an order of magnitude      more phrases than the other fields, and slightly more than an order of magnitude       more unique phrases than the other fields. Each field used a factor matrix with      14 factors, and the combination of all 56 factors for the four fields represented      27 separate, but not unique, themes. These themes could be placed in two major     categories, with two sub-categories per major category: Auto-immunity      (antibodies, inflammation) and circulation (peripheral vessel circulation,      coronary vessel circulation). All four sub-categories included representation      from each field. Thus, while the focus of the representation of each field in      each sub-category was moderately different, the four sub-category structure could      be identified by analyzing the total factors in each field. In the cluster     comparison phase of the study, the phrases used to create the clusters were the      most important phrases identified for each factor. Thus, the factor matrix served      as a filter for words used for clustering. While clusters were generated for all       four fields, the Title hierarchy tended to be fragmented due to sparsity of the      co-occurrence matrix that underlies the clusters. Therefore, the Title clusters      were examined at only the lower levels of aggregation. The Abstract, Mesh, and      Mesh + Title fields had the same first level taxonomy categories, auto-immunity      and circulation. At the second level, the Abstract, Mesh, and Mesh + Title fields      had the autoimmune diseases and antibodies sub-category in common. The Abstract      and Mesh fields shared fascia inflammation as the other auto-immunity      sub-category, while the other Mesh + Title sub-category focuses on vinyl chloride      poisoning from industrial contact, and consequences of antineoplastic agents.      However, in both cases, even though the words may be different, inflammation may       be the common theme. CONCLUSIONS: For taxonomy generation, especially at the      higher levels, each of the four fields has a similar thematic structure. At very       detailed levels, the Mesh and Title fields run out of phrases relative to the      Abstract field. Therefore, selection of field (s) to be employed for taxonomy      generation depends on the objectives of the study, particularly the level of      categorization required for the taxonomy. For information retrieval, or     literature-based discovery, selection of the appropriate field again depends on      the study objectives. If large queries, or large numbers of concepts or themes      are desired, then the field with the largest number of technical phrases would be      desirable. If queries or concepts represented by the more accepted popular     terminology is adequate, then the smaller fields may be sufficient. Because of      its established and controlled vocabulary, the Mesh field lags the Title or Abss       the Title or Abstract fields in currency. Thus, the Title or Abstract fields      would retrieve records with the most explicitly stated current concepts, but the       Mesh field would capture a larger swath of fields that contained a concept of      interest but perhaps had a wider range of specific terminology in the Abstract or     Title text. In addition, this study provides the first validated estimate of the       disparity in information retrieved through text mining limited to Titles and Mesh      terms relative to entire Abstracts. As much of the older biomedical literature      was entered into electronic databases without associated Abstracts,      literature-based discovery exercises that search the older medical literature may      miss a substantial proportion of relevant information. On the basis of this      study, it may be estimated that up to a log order more information may be      retrieved when complete Abstracts are searched.

PMID- 15171979   - OBJECTIVES: The use of IT in health care has merged advanced knowledge and skills      for health care professionals. Former studies indicate that basic skills in      computer use are no more than comprehensive competencies to manage electronically      stored information in health care. The purpose of this paper is to review the      literature focusing on the concept information literacy in the field of health,      nursing and medical informatics. The target is to find out how information      literacy is defined, in what kind of context it is presented and who are the      focus of interest. METHODS: An automated literature search was performed on-line       to Medline and by using the EndNote Bibliographic Software. All together the      number of papers analyzed was 97 or 78% of the total literature search result.      RESULTS: The survey indicates that the concept information literacy does not      exist as such in the literature, but it can be found as a synonym to 'computer     literacy' or even more obscure concepts such as 'informatics awareness' or     'computer experience'. The definitions of these concepts varied considerably. A      variety of descriptions of educational programs were also found, none were based       on the IMIA recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: In international cooperation such as      that of IMIA WG1, a wide range of efforts still needs to be carried out to      compile educational programmes in health informatics to enhance knowledge and      skills in computer use among health care professionals.

PMID- 15171978   - Integrated hospitals need a central planning and control system to plan patients'      processes and the required capacity. Given the changes in healthcare one can ask       the question what type of information systems can best support these healthcare      delivery organizations. We focus in this review on the potential of enterprise      resource planning (ERP) systems for healthcare delivery organizations. First ERP       systems are explained. An overview is then presented of the characteristics of      the planning process in hospital environments. Problems with ERP that are due to       the special characteristics of healthcare are presented. The situations in which       ERP can or cannot be used are discussed. It is suggested to divide hospitals in a      part that is concerned only with deterministic processes and a part that is      concerned with non-deterministic processes. ERP can be very useful for planning      and controlling the deterministic processes.

PMID- 15171977   - BACKGROUND: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that      the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous      opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated       with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the      quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in      the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to      enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and      practice. OBJECTIVE: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of      getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary      exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the      Exploratory Workshop on "New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health      Information Systems" (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health      Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April      2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The      overall program was structured in three main parts: (a). discussion of problems      and barriers to evaluation; (b). defining our visions and strategies with regard       to evaluation of health information systems; and (c). organizing short-term and      long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. RESULTS: The workshop      participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see ), comprising four     observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health      information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as      the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. CONCLUSION:      The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a      network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information      systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from      different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on      further research on information systems' evaluation.

PMID- 15171976   - OBJECTIVES: To inform the medical informatics community on the rational, goals,      evolution and present contents of the Medical Information Sciences program of the      University of Amsterdam and our achievements. METHODS: We elaborate on the      history of our program, the philosophy, contents and organizational structure of       the present-day curriculum. Besides, we describe the various didactic approaches       in the program and the rational for these. Finally, we analyze the contents of      our program in respect to the IMIA recommendations for dedicated programs in      health and medical informatics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Since its foundation in       1987, the program has undergone several major modifications. From a degree      program following medical school it developed into a full-fledged, dedicated      4-year program on medical information sciences training high-school graduates for     a master degree. The curriculum has been based from its outset within the      University of Amsterdam-Faculty of Medicine. This organizational structure leaves      ample opportunity for integration of the informatics-oriented components with the      medical and health care-oriented components in the program. Student-centered      approaches are heavily employed in the program, emphasizing students' critical      appraisal and a style of life-long learning. Overall, our program follows the      IMIA recommendations with slightly more focus on medicine and health care      organization.

PMID- 15135758   - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of a state health department policy to provide      allied health professional staff with access to a point-of-care, 24h, online      evidence system in terms of awareness, use and clinical impact of the system on      clinical practice; to identify perceived barriers to use, and differences in      measures between seven professional groups (physiotherapists, occupational      therapists, speech pathologists, dieticians, clinical psychologists, pharmacists       and social workers). METHOD: A convenience sample of 790 allied health      professionals from 65 randomly selected hospitals in New South Wales, Australia.       A self-administered questionnaire was distributed. Rates of use, frequency and      types of resources accessed were calculated. Comparisons between professional      groups were undertaken using Chi-square analyses and t-tests. RESULTS: The      results showed that 82% of allied health professionals had heard of the online      evidence system, and of those 76% had used it. Pharmacists had the highest rates       of use and social workers the lowest. Of users, 90% agreed that use of the system      had the potential to improve patient care and 45% reported direct experience of      this. Computer skills and easy access were significantly associated with use and       frequency of use. Among non-users, lack of specific training in the use of the      online evidence system and lack of time were the most frequently reported reasons      for not using the system. However, among users there was no relationship between       this training and the frequency or effectiveness of use, i.e. the ability to find      the information required. CONCLUSIONS: Allied health professionals will use an      online evidence system when it is provided, however there are marked differences       in use by professional groups. General training aimed at improving computer     skills appears more important in encouraging use of an online evidence system,      than specific system-based training. Perceptions of organisational and      professional support for allied health professionals to use online evidence as a       legitimate part of their work play an important role in influencing system use.

PMID- 15135757   - There is increasing evidence that patient safety can be improved by the      introduction of an integrated computer-based medical care system in hospital      settings. In this paper, we describe an integrated pharmaceutical information      system (IPIS) in which a patient's profile including his/her medication records      and prescriptions are collected from physician order entry systems and      pharmaceutical systems along with the history of patient care in the hospital.      Based on an individual patient's profile the IPIS can provide pharmaceutical      education information specifically to meet the patient's needs. The IPIS has been      developed and installed at Taipei Medical University Wanfang Hospital (TMUWFH)      since July 2002. Evaluation of the system showed that it can help patients to      effectively acquire drug information. This enables them to have a much better     understanding of the pharmacological properties of the medicines they are taking,      including adverse drug reactions and side-effects. In our opinion the system has       the potential to improve both patient safety and treatment outcomes.

PMID- 15135756   - With 773 beds and 3696 employees, the Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de      Medicina de Ribeirao Preto (HCFMRP)-Universidade de Sao Paulo, is one of the      largest medical institutions in Latin America. The complete process of      prescribing and distributing medication at HCFMRP involves the following stages:       prescribing (physicians); ordering (infirmary); separating and dispensing (main      drugstore); verifying and administering (infirmary). This was a manual process,      normally taking place in the morning. Bottlenecks were inevitable and the risk of      errors was elevated. An information system (IS) was devised and implemented with       a view to controlling such problems. This article addresses the construction of      this system and reports on a survey in which different groups of users have      evaluated the project.

PMID- 15135755   - OBJECTIVES: Hospitals have started to migrate their paper-based records to      computerized patient records (CPR). The majority of today's CPR systems are      stationary, which means that physicians use a clinical workstation to access CPR       information. But health care professionals need to request and enter information       at different locations, for example, on their daily ward round. This suggests the      use of mobile computers, enabling an ubiquitous access to needed data. Different       studies show that health care professionals are reluctant to use poorly designed       mobile CPR systems, as the work at the point of care is very time-pressured and      hectic. To design a system with high acceptance, it is essential to obtain      empirical insight into the work practices and context in which the mobile CPR     system will be used. METHOD: We investigated the physicians' work with the      patient record during their daily round. With the help of a compact notation      method, the physicians' interaction with the information system was recorded in      real time. Fourteen physicians from three different departments (internal      medicine, surgery, and geriatrics) of a middle-sized Swiss hospital participated       in our study. RESULTS: Physicians have clear access preferences when they      interact with the patient record during their daily round. There exists a clear     profile of access frequencies and patterns, respectively. As an example,      approximately 50% of all patient record accesses concern information about      medications, vital signs and lab test results. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: A CPR     system which is designed to reflect the access frequencies and patterns should      improve the efficiency of data entry and retrieval and thus result in a system      with high acceptance among physicians in the demanding environment during      hospital rounds.

PMID- 15135754   - INTRODUCTION: Computerised decision support systems are increasingly important in      primary care for the practice of evidence-based medicine and the development of      shared GP-patient decision making. However, despite their emergence, such systems      have not been entirely embraced by GPs. There is little qualitative research      exploring practical barriers to the adoption of decision support systems in this       setting. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with 15 GPs in the West Midlands.      RESULTS: Several practical barriers were identified to the use of computerised      support systems in primary care consultations. These included limitations of      practitioners' IT skills, problems for GPs in understanding the risk output of      systems and GP concerns about communicating risk sufficiently well to patients.      Concerns over the time implications of using a system in a consultation was also       identified as a barrier. CONCLUSION: Designers of decision support systems for     use in primary care consultations must account for the practical needs of users      when developing computerised support systems. Systems must be acceptable to the      format of a consultation, include definitions of what output means, and help      facilitate dialogue between the GP and the patient.

PMID- 15135753   - BACKGROUND: There are significant gaps in understanding what sources of patient      information physicians utilize in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).      OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study of physicians' self-report of      information-seeking behaviors in the NICU of an academic medical center. METHODS:      The study used a survey design to assess resident and faculty physicians'      perceptions of their utilization of written and verbal sources of patient      information. Faculty and resident responses were compared by t-tests to assess      how perceptions of information-seeking behavior might differ between these two      groups. RESULTS: Of the options listed in our survey, the three most commonly      reported information sources were: (1) the bedside flowsheet; (2) conversations      with resident physicians; and (3) conversations with nurses. Notes written by      physicians-especially resident notes-were the least reported source of patient      information. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' preference to use verbal communication is      consistent with prior studies. This study identifies that the bedside flowsheet      is also an important source of information, while other written      sources-especially resident notes-appear not to be utilized as frequently.      Understanding why physicians use or fail to use different sources of patient      information may shed light on ways to improve information exchange and reduce      medical error in complex settings such as the NICU.

PMID- 15135752   - OBJECTIVE: We examined the effectiveness of a one-on-one training strategy for     advanced proficiency in computer information systems (CIS) by clinicians in a      large Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). Specifically, this study assessed      the level of self-reported improvement in CIS efficiency following one-on-one      training, and assessed the perceived value of one-on-one training compared to      other teaching methods. DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study using a      paper-based survey of 129 clinicians practicing in the HMO. MEASUREMENTS: We used      a multi-item satisfaction index to measure clinician satisfaction with the      one-on-one training. We measured whether clinicians thought they were more      efficient using the system after training. RESULTS: The one-on-one method was      significantly preferred over other teaching methods. Compared to other CIS      components, use of the electronic medical record (EMR) improved most following      one-on-one training. Sixty-one percent of the clinicians reported major     improvements (i.e., >3 on a 5-point Likert scale; five being the highest score)      in using the EMR. CONCLUSION: Perceived effectiveness of one-on-one training and       overall satisfaction were ranked high by clinicians. The findings support the      assumption that clinicians value one-on-one training and value this training      method above other methods.

PMID- 15135751   - BACKGROUND: Few studies have explicitly addressed how e-mail technology may      affect non-physician clinic staff, even though these staff typically manage tasks      well suited to e-mail communication such as requests for prescription renewals,      laboratory and test results, and referral authorizations. GOAL: We conducted a      survey of staff members at 10 primary care clinics in Boston to further evaluate       non-physician staff attitudes towards e-mail use with patients. We subsequently      re-surveyed staff at three of these clinics after the implementation of Patient      Gateway, an application designed to facilitate secure electronic communication      between patients and the clinics. RESULTS: Before Patient Gateway implementation,      88% of surveyed staff were already using e-mail at least once a day for     work-related communication. Many of these staff members (24%) were already using       e-mail with patients. Forty-eight percent of staff members thought that      increasing e-mail use with patients could improve the quality of care their     practices delivered. However, staff reported having some hesitations about      increasing e-mail use with patients, mostly relating to security,      confidentiality, and workload. After Patient Gateway implementation, users      reported high satisfaction with the application and staff in general (users and      non-users of Patient Gateway) felt more enthusiastic about increasing e-mail use       with patients. CONCLUSIONS: In order to maximize the potential of staff-patient      e-mail, it is important that concerns relating to security, confidentiality, and       workflow are addressed, and patients must be given guidelines for the appropriate      use of e-mail. Secure applications designed with these issues in mind are likely       to be well received by staff members, and in turn physicians.

PMID- 15066565   - Because of its wide distribution and ease of use, the mobile phone, as a reliable      personal communications channel, offers an excellent basis for the provision of      reliable electronic communications services. In Finland, ca. 75% of the citizens       have a mobile phone and, at present and most likely also in the future, it is the      most widely spread service channel allowing reliable electronic communications.      Despite the restricted functions of the mobile phone, the citizens can use the      phone also as a communications medium. In 2001, the Finns sent over 1 billion SMS      messages. In Finland, TeliaSonera Finland Oyi and the Population Register Centre       (PRC) have closed a co-operation agreement with the aim of creating a mobile      phone service for the electronic identification of a person. The co-operation      launched is a significant development project from the perspective of the      citizens. As a result, the consumers will have a new alternative for reliable      electronic communications and commerce in data networks in addition to the      electronic identification card. In the future, it will be possible to use the      services of both public administration and the private sector by means of a      mobile phone more reliably than before, without a physical visit, e.g. to a      health centre or to another provider of healthcare services. The possibility of      identification and signature by a mobile phone allows an easier provision of      versatile services irrespective of time and place, because, in addition to voice,      text message, and WAP functions, the service can be utilised also in      communications services through the Internet, in which case, the mobile phone      acts like a card reader. From the perspective of reliable personal mobile      communications, the healthcare sector is one of the most significant and      challenging application areas.

PMID- 15066564   - To enhance medical cooperation between the hospitals and clinics around Osaka      local area, the healthcare network system, named Osaka Community Healthcare      Information System (OCHIS), was established with support of a supplementary      budget from the Japanese government in fiscal year 2002. Although the system has       been based on healthcare public key infrastructure (PKI), there remain security      issues to be solved technically and operationally. An experimental study was      conducted to elucidate the central and the local function in terms of a      registration authority and a time stamp authority in contract with the Japanese      Medical Information Systems Organization (MEDIS) in 2003. This paper describes      the experimental design and the results of the study concerning message security.

PMID- 15066563   - Several hereditary and other chronic diseases necessitate continuous and      complicated health care procedures, typically offered in different, often      distant, health care units. Inevitably, the medical records of patients suffering      from such diseases become complex, grow in size very fast and are scattered all      over the units involved in the care process, hindering communication of      information between health care professionals. Web-based electronic medical      records have been recently proposed as the solution to the above problem,      facilitating the interconnection of the health care units in the sense that      health care professionals can now access the complete medical record of the      patient, even if it is distributed in several remote units. However, by allowing       users to access information from virtually anywhere, the universe of ineligible      people who may attempt to harm the system is dramatically expanded, thus severely      complicating the design and implementation of a secure environment. This paper     presents a security architecture that has been mainly designed for providing      authentication and authorization services in web-based distributed systems. The      architecture has been based on a role-based access scheme and on the      implementation of an intelligent security agent per site (i.e. health care unit).      This intelligent security agent: (a). authenticates the users, local or remote,      that can access the local resources; (b). assigns, through temporary      certificates, access privileges to the authenticated users in accordance to their     role; and (c). communicates to other sites (through the respective security      agents) information about the local users that may need to access information      stored in other sites, as well as about local resources that can be accessed      remotely.

PMID- 15066562   - In recent years, major and widely accepted information security understandings      and achievements confirm that the problem is complex. They clarify that      technologies are fundamental tools, but management processes have even bigger     relevance, as also prestigious international magazines dossier clearly explained       recently. Such a magazine attention outlines the wide impact that the subject has      on watchful decision makers. ISO17799 is an emerging standard in information      security. In principle there are no reasons for considering it not applicable to       the health care sector. In practice, because of both the just conceptual level of      the standard and the peculiarities of the health care data and institutions, a      lot of analysis and design work need to be invested any time a health care      institution decides to deal with the subject. CEN/ENV 12924 is another emerging      standard certainly more on the spot of the health care. Nevertheless, it also      asks for evident further investigation. The practical case of information      security design, implementation, management, and auditing inside a      multi-specialty provincial Italian hospital will be described.

PMID- 15066561   - During the past decade, there have been many regional, national and European      projects focused on the development of platforms for secure access and sharing of      distributed patient information. A platform is needed because present local or     enterprise-wide information systems are typically not intended for     cross-organisational secure access of patient data. Most of the present secure      platforms are local or regional. Commonly used platform types in the health care       environment vary from secure point-to-point communication systems to      internet-based portals. This paper defines an enhanced cross-security platform      which makes it possible for different kinds of local, regional, and national      health information systems to communicate in a secure way. The proposed      evolutionary way interconnects regional or national security domains with the      help of a cross-platform zone. A more revolutionary model based on peer-to-peer     Grid like networks and dynamic security credentials is also discussed. The      proposed evolutionary model uses cross-domain security and interoperability      services to ensure secure communication and interoperability between different      security domains. The platform supports both communication defined beforehand and      adhoc dynamic access to distributed electronic health records (EHRs). The      internet is proposed as the "glue" between different regional or national      security domains.

PMID- 15066560   - A regional health information infrastructure is being developed in an internally       self-governing country which is a dependent territory of the British Crown, is      not part of the United Kingdom but is a member of the British Commonwealth. This       country of about 70000 inhabitants (and significant numbers of visitors) within      the British Isles shares many functions with the United Kingdom-from the      perspective of this paper the key shared functions relate to the infrastructure      of the departments of social security, social services, central registry, all      health care services and national insurance systems. Although it remains      independent in various other respects, for the most part it endeavours to achieve      an harmonious legislative relationship with the UK, and with the EU. One primary       goal of the information infrastructure development project is to provide links      between community, primary and secondary healthcare services and thereby to      ensure integrity of information as it refers to each individual receiving care      services. A second goal has been to integrate this environment with various other     government functions including the issuing and checking of NHS ID numbers and of       national insurance ID numbers, the payment of social welfare benefits, and      perhaps with other functions where access to a common list of names and addresses      is a significant factor. This paper outlines some of the issues that have arisen       in endeavouring to meet the often conflicting wishes and needs of different      groups as regards a health information infrastructure within a general public      sector information service.

PMID- 15066559   - In this paper, a range of issues influencing and affecting NHS information      governance policy and practice will be considered. The expansion of electronic      information services within the NHS and with its other information partners has      reinforced the need for effective security and confidentiality arrangements to      apply at multiple levels and in a variety of different business contexts. Added      to these, the need to consistently address issues of data protection, records      management and data quality, has resulted in a NHS information governance      initiative. This initiative is intended to provide approved tools, methods and      guidance that may be applied consistently throughout the NHS and that will be      underpinned through appropriate support and helpdesk services. This paper     emphasises the need to consider a range of applicable topics when determining a      responsible and extensible approach to the governance of information collected,      used and shared by healthcare organisations.

PMID- 15066558   - In a multi-speciality rehabilitation centre, where child neuropsychiatrists,      neurologists, physical rehabilitators, psychologists, nurses, therapists and      other health care professionals actively care for patients, the moment will      arrive when information security takes high priority on the chief medical officer     (CMO) agenda. This has happened at the La Nostra Famiglia Institution. Local push      to high priority arose from several concurrent forces, like privacy both on the      patient and on the doctor side, legal and ethical aspects. Recommendations on the      protection of medical data require appropriate technical and organisational      measures to be taken to protect personal data against unauthorised access,      alterations or any other form of inappropriate processing. In the same time quick      and easy access to patient information should be granted to authorised personnel       to ensure proper and in time treatment of patients. A long lasting sequence of      co-operative negotiation meetings between the CMO and the chief information      officer (CIO) led to appropriate outline of policies. We developed a suitable and      modular architecture for designing systems that can simultaneously manage an      increasing number of healthcare actors, objects and related access levels taking       into account temporal conditions. Actions for keeping the prototype in use on an       everyday basis are directly taken by the CMO.

PMID- 15066557   - The Electronic Health Record (EHR) will become a major support tool in health      care delivery. This leads to heavy requirements for its quality and security. The      EHR not only has to present the medical data of the patient as they are at the      present time, we can anticipate that in situations of medical audit, law suits,      quality control and self-assessment it may be necessary to be able to replay the       EHR output as it was or would have been at a certain moment in the past. This      facility could be required in order to be able to judge whether the behaviour of       the health care practitioner was adequate in view of the information in the EHR     as it was presented or could have been obtained from the EHR. First the need for       such facility is discussed. Next the question is posed how sufficient interest      for this aspect of the EHR can be raised and what role IMIA might play here. The       technical consequences of the implementation of such facility are explored and      they are found to be huge. The conclusion is that for a successful implementation      of an EHR that (at least partly) replaces the paper record the facility is a      must. However, in order to implement it, significant investments have to be made       especially in development and adaptation of software. If we do not take action      now the facility will not be available in time and the lack of such facility will      become a road-block for EHR implementation.

PMID- 15066556   - Challenges to the development of appropriate yet adaptable policy and tools for     security of the individual patient electronic health record (EHR) are proving to       be significant. Compounding this is the unique capability of e-health to      transgress all existing geo-political and other barriers. Initiatives to develop       and advance policy, standards, and tools in relation to EHR access control and      authorisation management must address this capability. Currently policy      development initiatives take place largely in an isolated manner. This      jeopardises the potential of e-health because decisions made in one jurisdiction       might hamper, even prevent, an e-health opportunity in another. This paper places      access and authorisation issues in an overall policy context through describing      current Canadian initiatives. The National Initiative for Telehealth (NIFTE)      Guidelines project is developing a framework of national guidelines for     telehealth. The Policy and Peer Permission (PPP) project is developing a unique      tool that provides persistent protection of data. The new corporate body      'Infoway' is developing a pan-Canadian electronic health record solution.      Finally, the Glocal e-Health Policy initiative is developing a tool with which to      identify and describe the inter-relationships of e-health issues amongst policy      levels, themes, and actors.

PMID- 15066555   - Enabling the shared care paradigm, centralised or even decentralised electronic      health record (EHR) systems increasingly become core applications in hospital      information systems and health networks. For realising multipurpose use and reuse      as well as inter-operability at knowledge level, EHR have to meet special      architectural requirements. The component-oriented and model-based architecture      should meet international standards. Especially in extended health networks      realising inter-organisational communication and co-operation, authorisation      cannot be organised at user level anymore. Therefore, models, methods and tools      must be established to allow formal and structured policy definition, policy      agreements, role definition, authorisation and access control. Based on the      author's international engagement in EHR architecture and security standards      referring to the revision of CEN ENV 13606, the GEHR/open EHR approach, HL7 and      CORBA, models for health-specific and EHR-related roles, for authorisation      management and access control have been developed. The basic concept is the      separation of structural roles defining organisational entity-to-entity      relationships and enabling specific acts on the one hand, and functional roles      bound to specific activities and realising rights and duties on the other hand.      Aggregation of organisational, functional, informational and technological      components follows specific rules. Using UML and XML, the principles as well as      some examples for analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of policy and       authorisation management as well as access control have been practically      implemented.

PMID- 15066554   - We conducted a drastic change in our hospital information system to support      patient participatory health care provided in the New Hiroshima University      Hospital (HUH). The new information system in HUH (HU-MIND II-Hiroshima      University Hospital Medical Intelligence and Notice Delivery system II) is      designed as "clinical management system" (CMS). The core of this CMS is the      electronic health record (EHR), which aims to assure both the patients' right to       know, and the attendants' accountability. It is evident that the team practice      including patients requires close communication. Data in the EHR are written not       only by physicians, but also by all coworkers, which will enable them to realize       the team communication and the ordering in a reliable way and to leave the      evidence of conducted practices. Moreover, the bedside information systems were      set-up at all 700 beds. Patients can access their anamnesis and future clinical      care procedures themselves. Based on the demand outlined above, the new      regulations of HUH are composed of 21 requirements, conditions of information      collection, accumulation and use. Our focus was how to make patients' right      compatible with attendants' accountability. As the data owners, patients have the      facility to access their own data at their bedsides. They can view their own      health condition and treatment program and can control the data flow.

PMID- 15066552   - Access rules to electronic patient records (EPR) have been issued by the Belgian       Council of Physicians. Access to identifiable data of the EPR is restricted to      anyone responsible for diagnosis, treatment and continuity of care of the      patient. By delegation, associated personnel, like secretaries, can also be      authorised to have access. A new perspective is given by the availability in 2003      of a national identification card allowing electronic signature of patients. It      could not only authorise but also forbid some accesses. A law in 2002 gives right      to patients to access to their own record. Health personnel can also be      identified by cards but the system is not yet implemented. In the meantime, local      measures have been made. We describe practical solutions that have been taken as       priorities in a University Hospital. It was felt more important to allow access      to lifesaving EPR data than to restrict its access by too strictly theoretical      rules. A pilot study (S3 project) is also in progress for interinstitutional      communication in Belgium, using the unique identification number of the patient      and a "third server".

PMID- 15066551   - Various codes of ethics, and in particular the IMIA Code of Ethics for Health      Information Professionals (HIPs), stipulate that the subject of an electronic      health record (EHR) has a series of security rights with respect to her/his EHR,       and that to some degree these rights center in the notion of informed consent.      This paper examines the ethical basis of this position, outlines its implications      for professionals, institutions and society in general, and identifies its      limits. Further issues that will be discussed include who carries the      responsibility for informed consent, what nature it should take, whether     web-based EHRs present ethically unique problems, and related security      implications.

PMID- 15066550   - Telehealth refers to the integration of information, telecommunication,      human-machine interface technologies and health technologies to deliver health      care, to promote the heath status of the people and to create health. The      Malaysian Telehealth Application will, on completion, provide every resident of      the country an electronic Lifetime Health Record (LHR) and Lifetime Health Plan      (LHP). He or she will also hold a smart card that will contain a subset of the      data in the Lifetime Health Record. These will be the means by which Malaysians      will receive "seamless continuous quality care" across a range of health      facilities and health care providers, and by which Malaysia's health goal of a      nation of "healthy individuals, families and communities" is achieved. The      challenges to security and privacy in providing access to an electronic Lifetime       Health Record at private and government health facilities and to the electronic      Lifetime Health Plan at homes of consumers require not only technical mechanisms       but also national policies and practices addressing threats while facilitating      access to health data during health encounters in different care settings.      Organisational policies establish the goals that technical mechanisms serve. They      should outline appropriate uses and access to information, create mechanisms for       preventing and detecting violations, and set sanctions for violations. Some      interesting innovations have been used to address these issues against the      background of the launching of the multimedia supercorridor (MSC) in Malaysia.

PMID- 15063381   - This paper reports outcomes of a national survey of health informatics (HI)      education and training carried out in the UK. A questionnaire to elicit details      of HI and IT skills teaching was derived from a national consensus document      (Learning to Manage Health Information, LtMHI). Forms were sent to all      pre-qualification medical and nursing schools and to a stratified sample of      postgraduate and post-registration programmes. Three case studies were carried      out in acute hospital trusts to gain insight into opportunities for continuing      professional development in health informatics and IT. Our evidence suggests that      in the UK, health informatics is not yet integrated into the clinical curriculum.      Nearly all the pre-qualification courses made some provision for teaching IT      skills. Nonetheless, many respondents felt that students did not receive      sufficient training. There was considerable variation in the amount of HI      teaching provided in the different educational sectors. The case studies      suggested very little HI training was provided for clinical staff and take-up of       provision was not monitored. A number of factors are holding up progress, the      most important being a lack of staff with the knowledge and skills to provide      academic leadership. The paper outlines some steps that need to be taken to      ensure health informatics is embedded in all clinical curricula.

PMID- 15063380   - This paper describes a methodology to assess health/medical informatics      graduate-level education curricula. The authors used the Certified Professional      in Healthcare Information Management Systems (CPHIMS) exam objectives published      by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) as the basis      for their assessment. The authors compared the 69 CPHIMS exam objectives against       four health/medical informatics program course objectives as stated in the      selected program's online graduate catalog. Results showed that the two programs       with management as a focus addressed the majority (67 and 59%) of the CPHIMS      objectives within core and elective courses combined. Overall, the other two      programs addressed closer to a third of the CPHIMS objectives (36 and 32%). This       methodology could prove to be useful in assisting students interested in      graduate-level training programs with a tool by which to measure the congruence      of the curricula of different programs with the mission of the programs and with       their own professional interests.

PMID- 15063379   - Asynchronous distance learning programs in health informatics are becoming more      prevalent, but there is little research on the best practices of asynchronous      learning technologies. There are virtually no data on the value of video of the      instructor compared to an audio slide presentation. We conducted a randomized      controlled trial in which we showed the same slide presentation to two groups of       students. One group saw a video of the instructor giving the lecture and the      other group saw the same presentation with audio only. Our results show that      adding video to an audio presentation does not lead to greater satisfaction or     greater learning. Students may think they want the video, but those who have it      are not uniformly pleased with it. These results demonstrate that despite the      intuitive appeal of streaming video, the addition of a video to an audio      presentation may not be worth the extra expense and effort.

PMID- 15063378   - This study assessed health informatics student satisfaction with two subsequent      versions of Prometheus, a web-based courseware system. Prometheus versions 4 and       5 were assessed to gauge the effect of modifications to improve the usability of       the system. The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS, version      7.0) was administered at the end of fall semester 2001 (in which Prometheus      version 4 was used) and again at the end of Spring 2002 (in which Prometheus      version 5 was used). QUIS contains measures of user satisfaction of the overall      system and 11 specific dimensions, including screen, terminology and system      information, learning, system capabilities, manuals and online help, multimedia,       and teleconferencing. In general, students had favorable judgments of Prometheus,      and their satisfaction level remained relatively stable across the two versions.       However, usability enhancements incorporated into version 5 produced no      significant differences in student satisfaction ratings. The results of this      study provide a benchmark for comparing the relative usability of alternative      courseware systems and demonstrate the utility of user satisfaction surveys for     assessing and improving courseware systems. With increases in the need for     compliance education and the education of clinicians with 'just in time      knowledge', courseware systems will become an integral part of the clinical      information systems, increasing the importance of usability studies such as this       one.

PMID- 15063377   - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect on learner satisfaction of introducing a      technology-enabled problem-based learning (PBL) approach into a health      informatics curriculum. Course redesign was undertaken to prepare students for     three 4-month work terms and a rapidly changing professional environment upon      graduation. METHODS: Twenty-six Canadian undergraduate students of a redesigned      course in biomedical fundamentals completed a midterm questionnaire in 2002.      Eight of these students participated in a focus group. RESULTS: Students agreed      that seven of nine functions provided by the web-based online course management      system enhanced their learning: private email (92.3%), calendaring (88.5%),      course notes (88.5%), discussion forums (84.5%), online grades (84.5%) assignment      descriptions (80.8%) and online quizzes (80.8%). Although students agreed that      two PBL activities enhanced learning (learning to present information) (84.5%)      and learning to identify information needed (73.1%), the majority of students      (69.2%) expressed a preference for the traditional lecture approach over the PBL       approach. Students reported feeling uncertain of what was required of them and      related anxiety accounted for most of the negative feedback. CONCLUSION: These      findings give us clear goals for improvement in the course beginning with a      comprehensive, carefully guided introduction to the processes of PBL. The      positive trends are encouraging for the use of web-enabled courseware and for the      further development of the PBL approach.

PMID- 15063376   - The project VISION2003 consists of several partners with different professions      ranging from medicine to medical informatics, from computer science to didactics.      Its aim is the development, testing, introduction and a long-time maintenance of       an open, web-based, intelligent and adaptive teaching and learning system for     medical education. The system is expected to enhance the acceptance and      efficiency of conventional ways of learning by supplementing and supporting them       and creating new methods for imparting knowledge ["VISION2003, Lehr-und      Lernsysteme in der Medizin: Intelligente und Multimediale, Internetbasierte      adaptive und intelligente Autorensysteme fur kooperatives Training in der     Medizin", (last valid on 17 January 2003) and Ein offenes sprachkonzept fur     verteilte wissensverarbeitung in der medizin, Tagungsabstract XVI International      Congress of the European Federation for Medical Informatics MIE, September 2000].      This is done exemplarily in the specific fields of oncology, accident-surgery and      cardiology in consideration of actual standards and didactical measures. The      range of possible applications is wide, from electronically accessible scripts      through example cases to complex simulations. The main focus of the project is      the creation of an open and flexible internet platform for delivering      multimedia-based learning units and the development of adaptive and intelligent      authoring systems.

PMID- 15063375   - In the context of a program in Health Information Science at the University of      Victoria in Victoria, BC, Canada, we have over the past 20 years made progress      and gained experience in delivering a number of courses in a project-based      experiential learning mode which links professionals and students in real world      projects. As we are moving towards distance education, we are facing the      challenge of translating these achievements into distance mode. The paper reviews      the principles which make project-based educational mode involving collaboration       with professionals desirable. We then review the experience with two specific      courses, in which local students work with distant and local representatives of      health institutions, respectively, on projects defined in the professional      environment. This experience showed that the approach is of mutual interest and      benefit to both the students and the professionals involved, but that a long lead      time, and considerable detail in the preparation are required to lead such      endeavors to success. We then discuss three alternatives to translating the      principles of these approaches into distance mode. Among the alternatives,      conducting a local project, closely affiliated with the teaching institution, or       relying on a mock project which is based on recorded examples from previous      projects, seem to be the most promising options. The alternative of having every       student pursuing a different project, which may be local for the student but      distant for the educational institution, is less attractive if faculty are      expected to assume responsibility for successful project completion. It may,      however, be the preferred solution if students are health professionals residing       at distant health care institutions. All three alternatives have drawbacks that      may limit the feasibility of project-based experiential learning in distance      mode.

PMID- 15063374   - The effectiveness and quality of health informatics systems' support to      healthcare delivery are largely determined by two factors-the suitability of the       system installed, and the competence of the users. However, the profile of users       of large-scale clinical health systems is significantly different from the      profile of end-users in other enterprises such as the finance sector, insurance,       travel or retail sales. Work with a mental health provider in Ireland, who was      introducing a customized electronic patient record (EPR) system, identified the      strong legal and ethical importance of adequately skills for the health      professionals and others, who would be the system users. The experience      identified the need for a clear and comprehensive generic user qualification at a      basic but robust level. The European computer driving license (ECDL) has gained      wide recognition as a basic generic qualification for users of computer systems.       However, health systems and data have a series of characteristics that      differentiate them from other data systems. The logical conclusion was the      recognition of a need for an additional domain-specific qualification-an "ECDL      Health Supplement". Development of this is now being progressed.

PMID- 15063373   - The purpose of this paper is to propose a case-based approach to instruction      regarding ethical issues raised by the use of information technology (IT) in      healthcare. These issues are rarely addressed in graduate degree and continuing      professional education programs in health informatics. There are important      reasons why ethical issues need to be addressed in informatics training. Ethical       issues raised by the introduction of information technology affect practice and      are ubiquitous. These issues are frequently among the most challenging to young      practitioners who are ill prepared to deal with them in practice. First, the      paper provides an overview of methods of moral reasoning that can be used to      identify and analyze ethical problems in health informatics. Second, we provide a      framework for defining cases that involve ethical issues and outline major issues      raised by the use of information technology. Specific cases are used as examples       of new dilemmas that are posed by the introduction of information technology in      healthcare. These cases are used to illustrate how ethics can be integrated with       the other elements of informatics training. The cases discussed here reflect      day-to-day situations that arise in health settings that require decisions.      Third, an approach that can be used to teach ethics in health informatics      programs is outlined and illustrated.

PMID- 15063372   - The core curriculum in the education of medical informaticians remains a topic of      concern and discussion. This paper reports on a survey of medical informaticians       with Master's level credentials that asked about computer science (CS) topics or       skills that they need in their employment. All subjects were graduates or     "near-graduates" of a single medical informatics Master's program that they      entered with widely varying educational backgrounds. The survey instrument was      validated for face and content validity prior to use. All survey items were rated      as having some degree of importance in the work of these professionals, with      retrieval and analysis of data from databases, database design and web      technologies deemed most important. Least important were networking skills and      object-oriented design and concepts. These results are consistent with other work      done in the field and suggest that strong emphasis on technical skills,      particularly databases, data analysis, web technologies, computer programming and      general computer science are part of the core curriculum for medical informatics.

PMID- 15063371   - Based on the recommendations of the International Medical Informatics Association      (IMIA, ) on education in health and medical informatics and on experiences in      founding a new school, the University for Health Informatics and Technology Tyrol      (UMIT, ), at Innsbruck, Austria, questions on education in health informatics,      medical informatics, and biomedical informatics are discussed. Suggestions are      made on (1). appropriate approaches for specialized educational programs in      biomedical and health informatics at the university level, on (2). resources and       infrastructures needed for running such programs at a high-quality level, and on       (3). strategies to be considered for the future development of such educational      programs. UMIT strives for an international top position in education and      research. It entirely concentrates on areas in research and education in      biomedicine and the health sciences. UMIT started in the academic year 2001/2002       with two educational programs. They lead to a B.Sc. degree (3 years) and a M.Sc.       degree (1.5-2 years) in medical informatics. In parallel Ph.D. students work in      research projects.

PMID- 15063369   - Master Classes arose within the performing arts and are now being offered in      system sciences. The IPhiE group of faculty from six universities in Europe and      the United States has offered Master Classes in health informatics to provide an       integrative forum for honors students. Featured are international views of health      systems, varied opportunities for student interaction and promotion of      informatics professionalism. Five years of experience indicate the success of      this concept and suggest changes that will be considered for the future.

PMID- 15063368   - PURPOSE: We are witnessing a paradigm shift in higher education as a result of      technological advances, adoption of on-line learning and a greater participation       in e-commerce by higher education providers. Given the dearth of academics with      high-level expertise in health informatics in many countries, we need to explore       how best to use our scarce resources to have the greatest possible impact      regarding the preparation of health professionals such that they can make the      best possible use of available informatics technologies to support health service      delivery. METHODS: The International Medical Informatics Association's (IMIA)      education working group together with its institutional (academic members) is      exploring how best to provide global and collaborative health informatics      education and research. Central Queensland University (CQU), one of these      members, is also working with the Health Level Seven (HL7) organisation to      provide specific standards education internationally using flexible delivery      methods. RESULTS: A number of issues requiring further exploration and      resolutions have been identified. An overview of these is provided.

PMID- 15063367   - We report on a course for medical informatics students on hospital information      systems, especially on its strategic information management. Starting as course      at the Medical Informatics Program of the University of Heidelberg/University of       Applied Sciences Heilbronn, it is now organized as international course in the      framework of the International Partnership for Health Informatics Education      (http:// www.iphie.org) jointly for medical information science students from the      University of Amsterdam, medical informatics students, as well as health      information management students from the Universities of Heidelberg/Heilbronn. In      2002, medical informatics students from the Master of Science program of the      newly founded University for Health Informatics and Technology Tyrol (UMIT) at      Innsbruck, Austria, joined. We report about the aim of this course, its audience,      and the educational programs involved, about its content and structure, as well      as about our experiences gained so far.

PMID- 15036081   - OBJECTIVES: To address the problem of alignment of health information systems to       healthcare processes, which is a major challenge in healthcare organizations; to       present a layered approach for system evolution and adaptation based on an      application framework and rapid application development; to accomplish a      demand-driven system evolution by embedding the software engineering process in      business process optimization projects and by closely involving end users to      improve their own work practices. METHODS: We have used a holistic health      information system as a core application framework. System functionality is      incrementally improved using an integrated "generator tool" for rapid application      development. We have developed an iterative and participatory software      engineering process, adapted to the conditions of the generator tool. The      documentation techniques provided by the Unified Modeling Language (UML) were      modified to achieve a straight forward documentation covering the whole      development cycle from the business process model to generator-based computer     applications. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The layered approach for system evolution      did provide an environment in which a flexible and participatory software      development process could be established. Today, generator-based applications are      used in all clinical departments of our 1200-bed University Hospital. We expect      that tools for rapid application development will be further improved and will      play an increasingly important role to establish responsive IT-infrastructures      where the application developer can concentrate on business process alignment      instead of coding and debugging.

PMID- 15036080   - Store-and-forward telemedicine, using e-mail to send clinical data and digital      images, offers a low-cost alternative for physicians in developing countries to      obtain second opinions from specialists. To explore the potential usefulness of      this technique, 91 chest X-ray images were photographed using a digital camera      and a view box. Four independent readers (three radiologists and one      pulmonologist) read two types of digital (JPEG and JPEG2000) and original film      images and indicated their confidence in the presence of eight features known to       be radiological indicators of tuberculosis (TB). The results were compared to a      "gold standard" established by two different radiologists, and assessed using      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. There was no statistical       difference in the overall performance between the readings from the original      films and both types of digital images. The size of JPEG2000 images was      approximately 120KB, making this technique feasible for slow internet      connections. Our preliminary results show the potential usefulness of this      technique particularly for tuberculosis and lung disease, but further studies are      required to refine its potential.

PMID- 15036079   - INTRODUCTION: CISMeF is a Quality Controlled Health Gateway using a terminology      based on the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus that displays medical      specialties (metaterms) and the relationships existing between them and MeSH      terms. Objective: The need to classify the resources within the catalogue has led      us to combine this type of semantic information with domain expert knowledge for       health resources categorization purposes. Material and METHODS: A two-step      categorization process consisting of mapping resource keywords to CISMeF      metaterms and ranking metaterms by decreasing coverage in the resource has been      developed. We evaluate this algorithm on a random set of 123 resources extracted       from the CISMeF catalogue. Our gold standard for this evaluation is the manual      classification provided by a domain expert, viz. a librarian of the team.      RESULTS: The CISMeF algorithm shows 81% precision and 93% recall, and 62% of the       resources were assigned a "fully relevant" or "fairly relevant" categorization      according to strict standards. DISCUSSION: A thorough analysis of the results has      enabled us to find gaps in the knowledge modeling of the CISMeF terminology. The       necessary adjustments having been made, the algorithm is currently used in CISMeF      for resource categorization.

PMID- 15036078   - Several studies have found that consumers report a high level of satisfaction      with the Internet as a health information resource. Belied by this positive      attitude, however, are other studies reporting that consumers were often      unsuccessful in searching for health information. In this paper, we present an      interview and observation study in which we asked health consumers to search for       health information on the Internet after first stating their search goals. Upon      the conclusion of the session they were asked to evaluate their searches. We      found that many consumers were unable to find satisfactory information when      performing a specific query, while in general the group viewed health information      retrieval (HIR) on the Internet in a positive light. We analyzed the observed      search sessions to determine what factors accounted for the failure of specific      searches and positive attitudes, and also discussed potential informatics      solutions.

PMID- 15036077   - The major criticisms and limitations of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) appearing      in the literature over the past decade can be summarized and categorized into      five recurring themes. The themes include: reliance on empiricism, narrow      definition of evidence, lack of evidence of efficacy, limited usefulness for     individual patients, and threats to the autonomy of the doctor/patient      relationship. Analysis of EBM according to these themes leads to the conclusion      that EBM can be a useful tool, but has severe drawbacks when used in isolation in      the practice of individual patient care. Modern medicine must strive to balance      an extremely complex set of priorities. To be an effective aid in achieving this       balance, the theory and practice of EBM must expand to include new methods of      study design and integration, and must adapt to the needs of both patients and      the health care system in order to provide patients with the best care at the      lowest cost.

PMID- 15036076   - Health care professionals need information delivery tools for accessing      information at the point of patient care. Personal digital assistants (PDAs), or       hand-held devices demonstrate great promise as point of care information devices.      An earlier study [The Constellation Project: experience and evaluation of      personal digital assistants in the clinical environment, in: Proceedings of the      19th Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, 1995, 678] on the      use of PDAs at the point of care found that hardware constraints, such as memory       capability limited their usefulness, however, they were used frequently for     accessing medical references and drug information [The Constellation Project:      experience and evaluation of personal digital assistants in the clinical      environment, in: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Symposium on Computer     Applications in Medical Care, 1995, 678]. Since this study was completed in 1995,      hand-held computer technology has advanced rapidly, and between 26 and 50% of      physicians currently use PDAs [Physician's use of hand-helds increases from 15%      in 1999 to 26% in 2001: Harris interactive poll results, Harris Poll. 8-24-2002      (electronic citation); ACP-ASIM survey finds nearly half of U.S. members use      hand-held computers: ACP-ASIM press release, American College of Physicians,      9-3-2002 (electronic citation)]. This use appears higher among residents, with      one recent study finding that over two-thirds of family practice residencies use       hand-held computers in their training programs [J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 9 (1)       (2002) 80]. In this study, we systematically evaluate PDA usage by residents in      our institution using quantitative and qualitative methods. Our evaluation      included a brief on-line survey of 88 residents in seven residency programs      including primary care and specialty practices. The surveys were completed      between 26 October 2001 and 30 April 2002. Follow-up interviews with 15 of the      surveyed residents were then conducted between 24 April 2002 and 13 May 2002. The      original contributions of this study are the evaluation of residents in primary      and specialty programs and evaluation of both medical application software and      the conventional personal organizational software (such as calendars and to-do      lists). This evaluation was also conducted using significantly advanced hardware       and software compared with previous studies [The Constellation Project:      experience and evaluation of personal digital assistants in the clinical      environment, in: Proceedings of the 19th Annual Symposium on Computer     Applications in Medical Care, 1995, 678]. Results of our survey and follow-up      interviews of residents showed most residents use PDAs daily, regardless of      practice or whether their program encourages PDAs. Uses include commercial      medical references and personal organization software, such as calendars and      address books. Concerns and drawbacks mentioned by these residents included      physical size of the PDA and the potential for catastrophic data loss. Another     issue raised by our results suggests that security and Health Information      Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance need to be addressed, in      part by resident education about securing patient data on PDAs. Overall, PDAs may      become even more widely used if two issues can be addressed: (a) providing secure      clinical data for the current patients of a given resident, and (b) allaying      concerns of catastrophic data loss from their PDAs (e.g. by educating residents      about procedures to recover information from PDA backup files).

PMID- 15036075   - Content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR) or content-based image      retrieval (CBIR) has been one on the most vivid research areas in the field of      computer vision over the last 10 years. The availability of large and steadily      growing amounts of visual and multimedia data, and the development of the      Internet underline the need to create thematic access methods that offer more      than simple text-based queries or requests based on matching exact database      fields. Many programs and tools have been developed to formulate and execute      queries based on the visual or audio content and to help browsing large      multimedia repositories. Still, no general breakthrough has been achieved with      respect to large varied databases with documents of differing sorts and with      varying characteristics. Answers to many questions with respect to speed,      semantic descriptors or objective image interpretations are still unanswered. In       the medical field, images, and especially digital images, are produced in      ever-increasing quantities and used for diagnostics and therapy. The Radiology      Department of the University Hospital of Geneva alone produced more than 12,000      images a day in 2002. The cardiology is currently the second largest producer of       digital images, especially with videos of cardiac catheterization ( approximately      1800 exams per year containing almost 2000 images each). The total amount of      cardiologic image data produced in the Geneva University Hospital was around 1 TB      in 2002. Endoscopic videos can equally produce enormous amounts of data. With      digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM), a standard for image      communication has been set and patient information can be stored with the actual       image(s), although still a few problems prevail with respect to the      standardization. In several articles, content-based access to medical images for       supporting clinical decision-making has been proposed that would ease the      management of clinical data and scenarios for the integration of content-based      access methods into picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) have been       created. This article gives an overview of available literature in the field of      content-based access to medical image data and on the technologies used in the      field. Section 1 gives an introduction into generic content-based image retrieval      and the technologies used. Section 2 explains the propositions for the use of      image retrieval in medical practice and the various approaches. Example systems      and application areas are described. Section 3 describes the techniques used in      the implemented systems, their datasets and evaluations. Section 4 identifies      possible clinical benefits of image retrieval systems in clinical practice as      well as in research and education. New research directions are being defined that      can prove to be useful. This article also identifies explanations to some of the       outlined problems in the field as it looks like many propositions for systems are      made from the medical domain and research prototypes are developed in computer     science departments using medical datasets. Still, there are very few systems      that seem to be used in clinical practice. It needs to be stated as well that the      goal is not, in general, to replace text-based retrieval methods as they exist at      the moment but to complement them with visual search tools.

PMID- 14644308   - Real time collaboration systems, in which participants share multimedia data and       applications in real time, have attracted many researchers in recent years. A      teleradiology consultation system based on the real time collaboration technology      is presented in this paper. Under the platform-independence consideration, Java      technologies are employed to construct the system. Applying this system, an      off-duty on-call radiologist can make diagnoses and report easily by viewing the       transferred images at home. Owing to the accessibility of image, all users can      examine and manipulate images consistently such that a secluded hospital can be      assisted to hold remote consultation. To reduce the network transmission time,      the command-passing and local command execution techniques are utilized to      achieve the screen synchronization. A pointer function is also developed to      maintain the cursor consistency in a more efficient manner during consultation      when a detail indication of the examined image is needed. Besides, a dialog      window is also designed for on-line conversation. Since Java programs can run on       heterogeneous platforms, the need for system maintenance and user training can be      substantially reduced.

PMID- 14644307   - STUDY OBJECTIVES: In the emergency medical services (EMS) system, appropriate      prehospital care can substantially decrease casualty mortality and morbidity.      This study designed a simulation model, evaluated the existing EMS system, and      suggested improvements. METHODS: The study focused on 23 networked EMS hospitals       affiliated with 36 emergency response units (subgroups) to perform two-tier     rescues (advanced life support [ALS] in addition to basic life support [BLS]      services) in Taipei, Taiwan. Using the existing EMS model as a base, this      research constructed a computer simulation model and explored several model      alternatives to achieve the study's objectives. The virtual models varied with      staffing level, number of assigned emergency network hospitals, and various      two-tier rescue probabilities. RESULTS: Increasing the staffing to two teams for       Hospital 22 lessened the call waiting probability (delay between rescue call and       ambulance dispatch) by 50%, even if the dispatch rate of the two-tier rescue      increased from the empirical 2% to a simulated 10 and 20%. Changing the two-tier       rescue pattern so each EMS subgroup cooperated with two specific, preassigned      network hospitals lowered the probability of patients having to wait for rescue      dispatch to under 1%. CONCLUSION: The following alternatives provided the      greatest combination of effectiveness, quality patient care, and cost-efficiency:      (1) because of its unique location, increase Hospital 22's staffing level to two       ALS teams. (2) Establish a specific rescue protocol for the two-tier system that       preassigns two network hospitals to each of the 36 EMS subgroups along with a      prearranged calling sequence. If implemented, this will improve EMS performance,       streamline the system, reduce randomness, and enhance efficiency.

PMID- 14644306   - BACKGROUND: To increase productivity, management in healthcare organisations have      introduced different types of process-oriented organisational configurations. Few      studies have addressed clinical practice and information management in these      settings. METHODS: A case study was performed at a paediatric clinic. Data was      collected from archives, through interviews, by participatory observation, and by      performing a focus group session. The collected data was analysed using a      qualitative and interpretative research strategy. RESULTS: A model was developed       of care practitioners' daily work in process-oriented organisations. The model      shows that clinical work was deeply integrated; the care activities were      dependent on supply activities and tightly connected to management routines.      CONCLUSION: The resulting model can be used to support development of health      information system (HIS) embedded in process-oriented healthcare work.

PMID- 14644305   - OBJECTIVES: The evaluation of computer assisted surgery (CAS) systems in terms of      clinical outcomes and ergonomic features is more and more relevant. The goal of      this paper is to provide criteria to define effective evaluation protocols of HCI      for CAS systems. METHOD: The proposed criteria include the use of two      questionnaires prepared by the authors, aimed at analyzing the subjective feeling      of the surgeons in using the system's tools, and objective aspects of the system.      These questionnaire have to be submitted to system's end-users and to experts in       HCI development iteratively during the system development or once at the end. A      quantitative evaluation of the main parameters related to the surgical      application is also required as an index of system efficacy. The demonstration      application was planning software developed for the total knee replacement (TKR).      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In our TKR planning software the proposed evaluation      procedure provided useful indications about the efficacy of HCI and also about      further developments of its design and functionality. Moreover, since surgical      training systems and surgical navigation platforms also share data treatment and       layout similar to the presented TKR planner, these kinds of applications can      benefit directly from the proposed approach to HCI design and evaluation.

PMID- 14644304   - Surveys conducted by mail can result in a very low response rate raising the      possibility of non-response bias that would question the validity of the      findings. In this study, we compare the demographic profiles between the      respondents and non-respondents, and conduct wave analysis as an alternative way       to estimate the non-response bias among the information technology (IT) users in       the health care industry. Our findings indicate that there is no significant      difference among the respondents when considering the duration (early versus      late) of response rate. Likewise, there was no significant difference when the      available demographic characteristics (facility type and user's position) of      those who responded were compared to the same characteristics of the sample. We      were able to reach similar conclusion by using either of the proposed methods;      analysis of demographic profiles of respondents versus non-respondents, and wave       analysis. Thus our findings support the validity of the results from low response      mail survey studies for IT users.

PMID- 14644303   - BACKGROUND: Problem lists are fundamental to electronic medical records (EMRs).      However, obtaining an appropriate problem list dictionary is difficult, and      getting users to code their problems at the time of data entry can be      challenging. OBJECTIVE: To develop a problem list dictionary and search algorithm      for an EMR system and evaluate its use. METHODS: We developed a problem list      dictionary and lookup tool and implemented it in several EMR systems. A sample of      10,000 problem entries was reviewed from each system to assess overall coding      rates. We also performed a manual review of a subset of entries to determine the       appropriateness of coded entries, and to assess the reasons other entries were      left uncoded. RESULTS: The overall coding rate varied significantly between      different EMR implementations (63-79%). Coded entries were virtually always      appropriate (99%). The most frequent reasons for uncoded entries were due to user     interface failures (44-45%), insufficient dictionary coverage (20-32%), and      non-problem entries (10-12%). CONCLUSION: The problem list dictionary and search       algorithm has achieved a good coding rate, but the rate is dependent on the      specific user interface implementation. Problem coding is essential for providing      clinical decision support, and improving usability should result in better coding      rates.

PMID- 14644302   - OBJECTIVE: To assess the definitions of success and failure as defined by the      participants of the Menucha Consensus Conference on Computerized Provider Order     Entry (CPOE). DESIGN: Thirteen experts from various fields participated in      Menucha Consensus Conference. Though they belonged to different fields, all of      them had some kind of experience in CPOE implementation. MEASUREMENTS: The      stories of these experts were analyzed using a constant comparison method and      partially ordered display. RESULTS: Each participant told a success and a failure      story. Definitions of success and failure, as well as variables contributing to      the success and failure of CPOE implementations, were extracted from the      transcripts. CONCLUSION: Analysis reveals that what is considered a failure is      context dependent and that it often is an antecedent to success.

PMID- 14644301   - BACKGROUND: Millions of people use the Internet as a source for health      information yet little is understood about how the use of the Internet for health      information is related to the doctor-patient relationship. OBJECTIVE: We      conducted the present study to understand the association between one's interest       in using the Internet for general and quality-oriented health information and      attitudes about one's communications with health care provider(s). DESIGN:      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Four community-based primary care practices in      Rhode Island. MEASUREMENTS: A single self-administered survey included items to      measure: interest in using the Internet to look for general and quality-oriented       information and a patient's perceptions of the degree to which their doctors over     the previous year have: (1) given them information and (2) engaged them in the      decision-making process. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients completed the survey.      Among patients without Internet access, interest in using the Internet for health      related activities was less among patients who felt that their doctor gave less      information: Odds ratio 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98) and greater among patients who      felt that their doctor engaged them more in decision making: Odds ratio 1.3 (95%       CI, 1.1-1.6). Among patients with Internet access, we found no relationship      between interest in using the Internet for health related activities and measures      of patient-physician communication or patient-physician decision making.      CONCLUSIONS: Interest in using the Internet for health information is greater for     those who (1) felt their doctors provided less information and (2) felt their     doctors engaged them more in the decision-making process, but this is true only      for those without access to the Internet.

PMID- 14519408   - The medical procedures at the patient bedside are out of the scope of current      HIS/RIS systems, which means that patient record and image data access during the      medical visit or the execution, recording and confirmation of the medicine      prescriptions, still do not enjoy computerized support. As a consequence, the      necessary inclusion of new data to the patient record, still needs to be carried       out through notations on paper and later typed, causes delays on the availability      of this information (Mobile computing in a hospital: the Ward-In-Hand project.      SAC 2000-ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Marco, 2000, Villa Olmo, Como,      Italy). This paper presents a software technology where the medical and nursing      staff will be equipped with a handheld computer connected by radio to a central      server that provides access to the electronic patient records and that will      actively inform about tasks pending distribution. The server acts as a database      for multimodal electronic patient record information, storing patient data from      computerized tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (MRI)      images and also medical findings, observations and prescriptions coded as DICOM      Structured Reports (Digital Image and Communications in Medicine). The prototype       described in this article implements a medical images and structured reports      server that makes the search and recovery of data stored in the DICOM standard      possible.

PMID- 14519407   - A web-based real-time operating, management, and monitoring system for checking      temperature and humidity within infant incubators using the Intranet has been      developed and installed in the infant Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We have created       a pilot system which has a temperature and humidity sensor and a measuring module      in each incubator, which is connected to a web-server board via an RS485 port.      The system transmits signals using standard web-based TCP/IP so that users can      access the system from any Internet-connected personal computer in the hospital.       Using this method, the system gathers temperature and humidity data transmitted      from the measuring modules via the RS485 port on the web-server board and creates      a web document containing these data. The system manager can maintain centralized      supervisory monitoring of the situations in all incubators while sitting within      the infant ICU at a work space equipped with a personal computer. The system can       be set to monitor unusual circumstances and to emit an alarm signal expressed as       a sound or a light on a measuring module connected to the related incubator. If      the system is configured with a large number of incubators connected to a      centralized supervisory monitoring station, it will improve convenience and      assure meaningful improvement in response to incidents that require intervention.

PMID- 14519406   - OBJECTIVES: Failures to follow-up abnormal test results are common in ambulatory       care. Information systems could assist providers with abnormal test result      tracking, yet little is known about primary care providers attitudes toward      outpatient decision support systems. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 216      primary care physicians (PCPs) that utilize a single electronic medical record      (EMR) without computer-based clinical decision support. RESULTS: The overall      response rate was 65% (140/216). Less than one-third of the respondents were      satisfied with their current system to manage abnormal laboratory, radiographs,      Pap smear, or mammograms results. Only 15% of providers were satisfied with their     system to notify patients of abnormal results. Over 90% of respondents felt      automated systems to track abnormal test results would be useful. Seventy-nine      percent of our respondents believed that they could comply better with guidelines      through electronic clinical reminders. CONCLUSIONS: Most PCPs were not satisfied       with their methods for tracking abnormal results. Respondents believed that      clinical decision support systems (CDSS) would be useful and could improve their       ability to track abnormal results.

PMID- 14519405   - OBJECTIVES: Information technology (IT) is emerging in health care. A rigorous      evaluation of this technology is recommended and of high importance for decision       makers and users. However, many authors report problems during the evaluation of       information technology in health care. In this paper, we discuss some of these      problems, and propose possible solutions for these problems. METHODS: Based on      own experience and backed up by a literature review, some important problems      during IT evaluation in health care together with their reasons, consequences and      possible solutions are presented and structured. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We      define three main problem areas-the complexity of the evaluation object, the      complexity of an evaluation project, and the motivation for evaluation. Many      evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly      accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address       those problems. Such a framework should help to formulate relevant questions, to       find adequate methods and tools, and to apply them in a sensible way.

PMID- 14519404   - In view of conflicting opinions about the advantages and disadvantages of frontal      teaching (FT) and problem-oriented learning (POL), we carried out a pilot project      in which both of these methods were used for teaching one specific course namely,      'Nursing Neurological Patients'. The aim was to determine whether there are      short- or long-term differences in student performance at examinations. The      results showed that over a short term (4 weeks after completion of the course),      students remembered very well what they had learnt in their frontal teaching      course, but lost some of this knowledge in the long term (7 months after     completion of the course). In contrast, in the long term, students retained      better what they had learnt under the method of POL.

PMID- 14519403   - Physicians' acceptance of telemedicine constitutes a prerequisite for its      diffusion on a national scale. Based upon the Theory of Interpersonal Behavior,      this study was aimed at assessing the predictors of physicians' intention to use       telemedicine in their clinical practice. All of the physicians involved in the      RQTE, the extended provincial telemedicine network of Quebec (Canada) were mailed      a questionnaire to identify the psychosocial determinants of their intention to      adopt telemedicine. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to assess      the measurement model and structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test      the theoretical model. The adapted theoretical model explained 81% (P<0.001) of      variance in physicians' intention to use telehealth. The main predictors of      intentions were a composite normative factor, comprising personal as well as      social norms (beta=1.08; P<0.001) and self identity (beta=-0.33; P<0.001). Thus,       physicians who perceived professional and social responsibilities regarding      adoption of telehealth in their clinical practice had stronger intention to use      this technology. However, it is likely that personal identity had a suppression      effect in the regression equation, indicating that physicians' intention to use      telemedicine was better predicted if their self-perception as telemedicine users       was considered. These results have several implications at the theoretical and      practical levels that are discussed in this paper.

PMID- 14519402   - Clinically useful controlled vocabularies should represent healthcare concepts      completely and with high reliability. Anticipating and pre-coordinating all      possible expressions (e.g. 'fracture of the left femur' and 'fracture of the      right femur') is not feasible. Variation in practice styles, requirements for the      granularity of content, the exponential growth of terminology size, and increased      cost of maintaining pre-coordinated terminologies lead us to conclude that no      enumerated terminology can ever be truly comprehensive. Compositional      terminologies are one potential solution to the problem of content completeness,       but carry a risk of generating expressions whose equivalency cannot be easily      determined. In order for post-coordinated expressions to be comparable, a      sufficiently detailed formal mechanism for information representation is      necessary. Comparable data for post-coordinated expressions requires      normalization of both the contents and the semantics of the contents of the      terminology with the information captured in post-coordinated expressions. In      addition, comparable data requires a storage and messaging paradigm robust enough      to faithfully represent the information contained within arbitrarily complex      compositional expressions. We present a formalism for storing, and sending      messages containing compositional expressions using a large-scale reference      terminology. It is our intent that this formalism be used to algorithmically      determine whether or not messages contain comparable data. In addition, we      advocate transmitting the upward transitive closure of subsumption of all      concepts, to improve comparability of data and to decrease reliance on locally      stored versions of the underlying reference terminology.

PMID- 12909188   - INTRODUCTION: Within diabetes care, the majority of health decisions are in the      hands of the patient. Therefore, the concepts of disease management and self-care      represent inescapable challenges for both patient and healthcare professionals,      entailing a considerable amount of learning. Thus, a computerised diabetes      disease management systems (CDDM) is to be seen not merely as tools for the      medical treatment, but also as pedagogical tools to enhance patient competence.      HYPOTHESIS: The unfortunate lack of success for most knowledge-based systems      might be related to the problem of finding an adequate way of evaluating the      systems from their development through the implementation phase to the daily      clinical practice. The following presents the initial methodological      considerations for evaluating the usefulness of a CDDM system called DiasNet,      which is being implemented as a learning tool for patients. The evaluation of      usefulness of a CDDM, we claim, entails clinical assessment taking into account      the challenges and pitfalls in diabetes disease management. RESULTS: Drawing on      activity theory, we suggest the concept of copability as a supplement to      'usability' and 'utility' when determining 'usefulness'. We maintain that it is      necessary to ask how well the user copes with the new situation using the system.      As ways to measure copability of DiasNet the concepts of coping and learning are       discussed, as well as ways this methodology might inform systems development,      implementation, and daily clinical practice.

PMID- 12909187   - BACKGROUND: The medical curriculum has changed with the adoption of the      student-centered learning paradigm. Clinical reasoning learning (CRL) is used in       order to develop and improve students' clinical reasoning and problem-solving      skills. PURPOSE: We have observed that, in complement to traditional CRL      sessions, students commonly consult resources available on the internet. Based on      this observation, our objective is to create computer tools to coordinate CRL      sessions at distance, integrating these electronic resources at every step of the      reasoning process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to create the system, we      elaborated an object-oriented model of a computer-supported collaborative      learning environment. The proposed system includes a local web-server to store      electronic resources and a relational database to store their electronic      addresses (urls). JAVA was used as the programming language. RESULTS: We      developed a set of cooperative platform-independent tools. This environment      includes a communication tool. Multimedia data exchange is possible. Information       is shared thanks to an electronic notepad and whiteboard tools. PERSPECTIVES:      This learning environment will be integrated in the French Virtual Medical      University project, and is intended to be used for undergraduate, internships,      residency or continuing medical education.

PMID- 12909186   - INTRODUCTION: We have recently shown, in studies with patients with Type 1      (insulin dependent) diabetes, that alcohol intake at 21:00 h significantly      reduced blood glucose values after 10-12 h, compared with control studies with no      alcohol. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesised that this was due to the following effects      of alcohol: (1) alcohol metabolism increases NADH, leading to a reduction in      hepatic gluconeogenesis; (2) increased glycogen phosphorylase activity depletes      hepatic glycogen stores; (3) after the alcohol is metabolised, hepatic insulin      sensitivity is increased, leading to the restoration of glycogen stores and      reduction in blood glucose levels; and (4) consequently, after several hours,      glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity return to normal. RESULTS: A model      describing these changes (DiasNet-Alcohol) was implemented into the DiasNet model      of human glucose metabolism. Our study suggests that the DiasNet-Alcohol model      gives a reasonable approximation of these effects of alcohol on blood glucose      concentration observed in our study and supports our hypothesis for the mechanism      behind these effects in Type 1 diabetes.

PMID- 12909185   - Approaches to formalization of medical guidelines can be divided into      model-centric and document-centric. While model-centric approaches dominate in      the development of clinical decision support applications, document-centric,      mark-up-based formalization is suitable for application tasks requiring the      'literal' content of the document to be transferred into the formal model.      Examples of such tasks are logical verification of the document or compliance      analysis of health records. The quality and efficiency of document-centric      formalization can be improved using a decomposition of the whole process into      several explicit steps. We present a methodology and software tool supporting the      step-by-step formalization process. The knowledge elements can be marked up in      the source text, refined to a tree structure with increasing level of detail,      rearranged into an XML knowledge base, and, finally, exported into the      operational representation. User-definable transformation rules enable to      automate a large part of the process. The approach is being tested in the domain       of cardiology. For parts of the WHO/ISH Guidelines for Hypertension, the process       has been carried out through all the stages, to the form of executable      application, generated automatically from the XML knowledge base.

PMID- 12909184   - The Etablissement francais des Greffes (EfG) is a state agency dealing with      Public Health issues related to organ, tissue and cell transplantation in France.      The evaluation of organ retrieval and transplantation activities, one of its      missions, is supported by a national information system (EfG-IS). The EfG-IS is      moving towards a new n-tier architecture comprising a terminology server for     end-stage diseases, organ failure, dialysis and transplantation (EfG-TS).      Following a preliminary audit of the existing coding system and in order to      facilitate data recording, to improve the quality of information, to assume      compatibility with terminological existing standards and to allow semantic      interoperability with other local, national or international registries, a      specific work has been conducted on the thesauri to integrate within the EfG-TS.       In this paper focusing on the server's content rather than the container, we      report first the functional and cognitive requirements that resulted from the      preliminary audit. We then describe the methodological approach used to build the      terminological server on "sound ontological foundations". We performed the      semantic analysis of existing medical terms to set up disease description      frame-like structures. These diseases description frames consist of a limited set      of nosological discriminating slots such as etiology, semiology, pathology,      evolution and associated diseases. Each relevant medical term is thus associated       to a concept defined and inserted within a hierarchy according to disease      description frame resulting from the semantic analysis. Last, because this      terminological server is shared by various transplant and dialysis centers to      record patient data at different time point, contextualization of terms appeared       as one of the functional requirements. We will also point out various contexts      for medical terms and how they have been taken into account.

PMID- 12909183   - OBJECTIVE: To describe a model for analysing complex medical decision making      tasks and for evaluating their suitability for automation. METHOD: Assessment of       a decision task's complexity in terms of the number of elementary information      processes (EIPs) and the potential for cognitive effort reduction through EIP      minimisation using an automated decision aid. RESULTS: The model consists of five      steps: (1) selection of the domain and relevant tasks; (2) evaluation of the      knowledge complexity for tasks selected; (3) identification of cognitively      demanding tasks; (4) assessment of unaided and aided effort requirements for this      task accomplishment; and (5) selection of computational tools to achieve this      complexity reduction. The model is applied to the task of antibiotic prescribing       in critical care and the most complex components of the task identified. Decision      aids to support these components can provide a significant reduction of cognitive      effort suggesting this is a decision task worth automating. CONCLUSION: We view      the role of decision support for complex decision to be one of task complexity      reduction, and the model described allows for task automation without lowering      decision quality and can assist decision support systems developers.

PMID- 12909182   - Clinical guidelines can improve the quality of care in multiple trauma. In our     Department of Trauma Surgery a specific guideline is available paper-based as a      set of flowcharts. This format is appropriate for the use by experienced      physicians but insufficient for electronic support of learning, workflow and      process optimization. A formal and logically consistent version represented with       a standardized meta-model is necessary for automatic processing. In our project      we transferred the paper-based into an electronic format and analyzed the      structure with respect to formal errors. Several errors were detected in seven      error categories. The errors were corrected to reach a formally and logically      consistent process model. In a second step the clinical content of the guideline       was revised interactively using a process-modeling tool. Our study reveals that      guideline development should be assisted by process modeling tools, which check      the content in comparison to a meta-model. The meta-model itself could support      the domain experts in formulating their knowledge systematically. To assure      sustainability of guideline development a representation independent of specific       applications or specific provider is necessary. Then, clinical guidelines could      be used for eLearning, process optimization and workflow management additionally.

PMID- 12909181   - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the seizure descriptions given by a group of      neurologists/epileptologists are discriminative. METHOD: We constructed templates      for various seizure types describing how often symptoms were selected by the      participants. We defined a matching score to indicate the match between such a      template and the symptoms selected by each neurologist/epileptologist      individually and computed the scores for each of the sets of selected symptoms      with all templates. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the      templates. RESULTS: Data were collected from 24 participants. The matching scores      and the correlation coefficients both show that participants provide      discriminative descriptions of the seizure types. Descriptions of aggregated      seizure types, such as primary generalized seizures, are less discriminatory than      the descriptions of more specific seizure types. CONCLUSION: We concluded that      the participants in our study selected symptoms that result in discriminative      descriptions of the seizure types. This indicates that knowledge elicitation by      using the opinions of a group of clinical experts is possible. The study also      indicates that the design of the study could be ameliorated in several ways.      These findings will be taken into account when designing the final study.

PMID- 12909180   - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop reliable descriptions of various seizure types,       which will be used as a basis for decision support. We use expert opinions in      this process. In this contribution we evaluate the inter-participant agreement in      the selection of frequently occurring symptoms for the description of seizure      types. METHOD: We compared the actual agreement among participants with the      agreement that would result from random symptom selection as well as with the      maximal agreement attainable. For each seizure type we calculated the reliability      coefficients of the responses. RESULTS: For all seizure types we found that the      agreement in symptom selection among the participants is significantly higher     than expected by chance, but not reaching the maximum agreement attainable. The      reliability coefficients varied between 0.56 and 0.74 for the various seizure      types. CONCLUSION: Although the participants do not reach the maximum agreement      attainable in the selection of symptoms, the majority agreement on characteristic      frequently occurring symptoms for the different seizure types does approach the      maximum agreement attainable. Therefore, we conclude that expert opinions can be       used for building descriptions of seizure types. However, to derive a reliable      set of symptoms for the construction of the diagnostic reference frames (DRFs)      more participants are needed.

PMID- 12909179   - People relying much on vision in the control of posture are known to have an      elevated risk of falling. Dependence on visual control is an important parameter       in the diagnosis of balance disorders. We have previously shown that virtual      reality (VR) methods can be used to produce visual stimuli that affect balance,      but suitable stimuli need to be found. In this study, the effect of six different      VR stimuli on the balance of 22 healthy test subjects was evaluated using force      platform posturography. We report in more detail and expand the results published      earlier. According to the tests two of the stimuli have a significant      destabilizing effect on balance. In addition a significant displacement effect on      the subject's center of pressure (COP) was found. Thus it is shown that the      design of VR stimuli to cause different effects on the control of balance is      possible.

PMID- 12909178   - PURPOSE: The Netherlands is developing a set of national domain information      models to support electronic information exchange and electronic patient records       (EPR). These domain information models aim to support the development, adoption,       implementation and maintenance of the EPR in Dutch healthcare practice. This      article describes the modelling for a pilot for mother- and childcare      (perinatology). METHODOLOGY: Cases' from perinatology are modelled using the      Health Level 7 version 3 Reference Information Model (HL7 RIM) as the methodology      and tools. RESULTS: Results include descriptions of care processes, communication      and information that are broken down into interaction tables and tables with      information. Next several domain information models for perinatology are drawn      up. These models allow healthcare professionals to recognise their communication,      content and work. Currently, the models facilitate discussion and critique by      clinician and informaticians. CONCLUSION: The perinatology domain information      models facilitate in building implementations because they contain sufficient      details for EPR developers and for developers of messages for information      exchange. The first results of the project are useful, despite the fact that HL7       RIM modelling methodology is still not finalized. The approach bridges      professional content, technical implementation of messages, and future EPR     development.

PMID- 12909177   - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to investigate methods whereby a      combination of speech recognition and automated indexing methods substitute for     current transcription and indexing practices. METHODS: We based our study on      existing speech recognition software programs and on NOMINDEX, a tool that      extracts MeSH concepts from medical text in natural language and that is mainly      based on a French medical lexicon and on the UMLS. For each document, the process      consists of three steps: (1) dictation and digital audio recording, (2) speech      recognition, (3) automatic indexing. The evaluation consisted of a comparison      between the set of concepts extracted by NOMINDEX after the speech recognition      phase and the set of keywords manually extracted from the initial document. The      method was evaluated on a set of 28 patient discharge summaries extracted from      the MENELAS corpus in French, corresponding to in-patients admitted for     coronarography. RESULTS: The overall precision was 73% and the overall recall was      90%. Indexing errors were mainly due to word sense ambiguity and abbreviations. A      specific issue was the fact that the standard French translation of MeSH terms      lacks diacritics. A preliminary evaluation of speech recognition tools showed      that the rate of accurate recognition was higher than 98%. Only 3% of the      indexing errors were generated by inadequate speech recognition. DISCUSSION: We      discuss several areas to focus on to improve this prototype. However, the very      low rate of indexing errors due to speech recognition errors highlights the      potential benefits of combining speech recognition techniques and automatic      indexing.

PMID- 12909176   - Evidence-based practice requires flexible systems for information retrieval.      Search processes in electronic databases must be based on terms, which are      familiar to professionals and describe accurately the problem to be solved. The      paper describes the process of evolving a controlled nursing vocabulary for     indexing and information retrieval purposes. The vocabulary is based on terms of       the Medline thesaurus the medical subject headings (MeSH) by National Library of       Medicine and the International Classification for Nursing Practice by the      International Council of Nurses. The created vocabulary consists of 10 themes      central to nursing domain. The content was compiled using Delphi technique. The      expert panel had four rounds and at the first stage the vocabulary consists of      558 terms. The validity of the vocabulary has been tested for indexing nursing      research and based on the validation the expert panel has made some changes for     the hierarchy and content. The vocabulary will be added as an independent theme      to the Finnish thesaurus the FinMeSH.

PMID- 12909175   - BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly      being used in health care. Rigorous evaluations of ICT applications during both      introduction and routine use are of great importance for decision makers and      users. Within evaluation research, two main (and often rather distinct)      traditions can be found: the objectivistic and the subjectivistic tradition.      METHODS: The theory of triangulation deals with the integration of methods and      approaches as to conduct better evaluation studies. In evaluation research,      triangulation in general means the multiple employment of various sources of      data, observers, methods, and/or theories in investigations of the same      phenomenon. We applied triangulation aspects in the analysis of the effects of a       computer-based nursing documentation system. RESULTS: We discuss, based on this      case study, what benefits can be obtained from applying triangulation in an      evaluation study. We show how both the validation of results and the completeness      of results can be supported by triangulation. DISCUSSION: The decision whether     triangulation may be useful for a given research question, and how it may be      correctly applied, requires-like other evaluation methods-intensive training and       methodological experience. Medical informatics evaluation research may profit      from this well-established theory.

PMID- 12909174   - OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this study was to find an easy to implement method to      detect compound medical diagnosis in Hungarian medical language and decompose      them into expressions referring to a single disease. METHODS: A corpus of      clinical diagnoses extracted form discharge reports (3,079 expressions, each of      them referring to only one disease) was represented in an n-gram tree (a series      of n consecutive word). A matching algorithm was implemented in a software, which      is able to identify sensible n-grams existing both in test expressions and in the      n-gram tree. A test sample of another 92 diagnoses was decomposed by two      independent humans and by the software. The decompositions were compared with      measure the recall and the precision of the method. RESULTS: There was not full      agreement between the decompositions of the humans, (which underlines the      relevance of the problem). A consensus was arrived in all disagreed point by a      third opinion and open discussion. The resulting decomposition was used as a gold      standard and compared with the decomposition produced by the computer. The recall      was 82.6% the precision 37.2%. After correction of spelling errors in the test      sample the recall increased to 88.6% while the precision slightly decreased to      36.7%. CONCLUSION: The proposed method seems to be useful in decomposition of      compound diagnostic expressions and can improve quality of diagnostic coding of      clinical cases. Other statistical methods (like vector space methods or neural      networks) usually offer a ranked list of candidate codes either for single or     compound expressions, and do not warn the user how many codes should be chosen.      We propose our method especially in a situation where formal NLP techniques are      not available, as it is the case with scarcely spoken languages like Hungarian.

PMID- 12909173   - PROBLEM: The introduction of Diagnosis Related Groups as a basis for hospital      payment in Germany announced essential changes in the hospital reimbursement      practice. A hospital's economical survival will depend vitally on the accuracy      and completeness of the documentation of DRG relevant data like diagnosis and      procedure codes. In order to enhance physicians' coding compliance, an      easy-to-use interface integrating coding tasks seamlessly into clinical routine      had to be developed. A generic approach should access coding and clinical      guidelines from different information sources. METHODS: Within the Electronic      Medical Record (EMR) a user interface ('DRG Control Center') for all DRG relevant      clinical and administrative data has been built. A comprehensive DRG-related web       site gives online access to DRG grouping software and an electronic coding      expert. Both components are linked together using an application supporting      bi-directional communication. Other web based services like a guideline search      engine can be integrated as well. RESULTS: With the proposed method, the      clinician gains quick access to context sensitive clinical guidelines for     appropriate treatment of his/her patient and administrative guidelines for the      adequate coding of the diagnoses and procedures. This paper describes the design       and current implementation and discusses our experiences.

PMID- 12909172   - Diagnosis related groups (DRGs) were the first health management tool to group      patients in clinical meaningful categories with homogeneous resources      consumption. They belong to case mix measures that have been introduced in the      USA in the seventies to identify clinical differences in groups of patients as      well as to document variation in hospitals and physicians practices by comparing       similar groups with each others. They are also used to adjust payment rates and      to improve quality of care. This innovative concept migrated from the USA to      several Western European countries and to Australia first, to Eastern Europe and       Asia soon thereafter. The main objective in most countries concerns a hospital      financing new methodology, based on similar groups of patients, by applying a      global budget. The main result of this international overview of 25 countries is       to show the difficulty to make international comparisons, mainly because of the      absence of a universal classification system for procedures. Furthermore,      diagnostic classification systems to group patients vary also by country. These      obstacles to compare hospital and physician practices have profound roots in      cultural differences and in political sensitivity for organising health care      delivery between countries. The development of an appropriate Case Mix grouper     tool including uniform diagnoses and procedures codes, leading to international      use becomes a public health priority.

PMID- 12909171   - During the past 10-15 years, Regional Health Care Networks (RHCN) have been      established in many regions throughout the world. RHCN build on well-known      techniques, methodologies and appropriate standards. Most of the European      Countries today have set up IT strategic plans that focus on the establishment of      RHCN. The benefits of having access to all relevant information are tremendous      and contribute to cost-effective and coherent health services. By the rapid      spread and use of Internet, technology has made it possible to interconnect all      kinds of applications. In 2000, the most experienced regions in Europe joined      PICNIC, a European project to develop the Next Generation Regional Health Care      Networks and to support their new ways of providing health and social care. The      previous generation of Regional Health Care Networks supported the      interconnection of applications by transfer of messages. Messaging is an      effective means of integration for isolated high-specialised systems that only      need to exchange data. This service will continue to be one of the most important      services in the future health care networks. However, tighter coupling may be      desirable in some instances to avoid replicating the same functionality in      several applications. In other words, certain services can be common and used by       a number of applications instead of building that service inside each      application. These common services are called middleware services. In PICNIC      (http://www.medcom.dk/picnic), a new middleware Collaboration IT service has been      identified and developed. This service allows the end users to perform real-time       clinical collaboration, with exchange of text, structured data, voice and images       across the limits of a single region. A clinical collaboration is associated with      the shared clinical context to provide a record of relevant clinical information       and facilitates synchronous as well as asynchronous collaboration. This new IT      service builds on the increasing popularity of instance messaging and presence      systems that facilitate smooth transition between synchronous and asynchronous      interaction. The new Collaboration IT service is expected to have a strong impact      on the practice of health care in the next generation of Regional Health Care      Networks.

PMID- 12909170   - The goal of the German project "Standardization of Communication between      Information Systems in Physician Offices and Hospitals using XML" (aka SCIPHOX)      in its first phase is to provide information exchange based on the Extended      Markup Language XML between Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Physician      Office Systems (POS). The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), a standard      developed by the Health Level Seven organization (HL7), was chosen to serve as      the "backbone" specification. The CDA is an ANSI approved document architecture      for exchange of clinical information using XML. In phase I of the SCIPHOX project      the proposal specifies the use of the CDA as a generalized international standard      in the national context of discharge and referral letters in Germany. The      specification defines how to use the CDA header and associated vocabularies by      providing a translation and interpretation of the CDA header tags and provides a       solution for taking local needs (insurance information etc.) into account.

PMID- 12909169   - OBJECTIVE: Health care information systems still comprise legacy systems to a      certain extent. For reengineering legacy systems a thorough remodeling is      inalienable. Current modeling techniques like the Unified Modeling Language (UML)      do not offer a systematic and comprehensive process-oriented method for     remodeling activities. METHOD: We developed a systematic method for remodeling      legacy systems in health care called Qumquad. Qumquad consists of three major     steps: (i) modeling the actual state of the application system, (ii) systematic      identification of weak points in this model and (iii) development of a target      concept for the reimplementation considering the identified weak points. RESULTS:      We applied Qumquad for remodeling a documentation and therapy planning system for     pediatric oncology (DOSPO). As a result of our remodeling activities we regained       an abstract model of the system, an analysis of the current weak points of DOSPO       and possible (partly alternative) solutions to overcome the weak points.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Qumquad proved to be very helpful in the reengineering      process of DOSPO since we now have at our disposal a comprehensive model for the       reimplementation of DOSPO that current users of the system agree on. Qumquad can       easily be applied to other reengineering projects in health care.

PMID- 12909168   - Integration of the heterogeneous application systems in healthcare is needed to      support the clinical and administrative work, patient-centric care, regional      interoperability and utilisation of both valuable legacy systems and new      technologies. The integration activity is complicated, and must be supported by      flexible processes and methods. The integration methods should support the      evaluation and specification of different integration approaches, standards and      technologies on many interoperability levels. We introduce a process for     specifying many integration decisions for a given integration situation. The      process is part of an integration method, which is validated in PlugIT project in      Finland.

PMID- 12909167   - Healthcare environments are a representative case of collaborative environments      since individuals (e.g. doctors) in many cases collaborate in order to provide      care to patients in a more proficient way. At the same time modern healthcare      institutions are increasingly interested in sharing access of their information      resources in the networked environment. Healthcare applications over the Internet      offer an attractive communication infrastructure at worldwide level but with a      noticeably great factor of risk. Security has, therefore, become a major concern.      However, although an adequate level of security can be relied upon digital      certificates, if an appropriate security model is used, additional security      considerations are needed in order to deal efficiently with the above team-work      concerns. The already known Hybrid Access Control (HAC) security model supports      and handles efficiently healthcare teams with active security capabilities and is      capable to exploit the benefits of certificate technology. In this paper we      present the way for encoding the appropriate authoritative information in various      types of certificates, as well as the overall operational architecture of the      implemented access control system for healthcare collaborative environments over       the Internet. A pilot implementation of the proposed methodology in a major Greek      hospital has shown the applicability of the proposals and the flexibility of the       access control provided.

PMID- 12909166   - This article describes the architecture of an EPR system developed for the PropeR     project. This EPR system not only aims at supporting home care of stroke      patients, but is also designed in such a way that it can be ported to other     medical services without much effort. We will briefly describe the Stroke Service      and the related PropeR project. Starting from a list of requirements to construct      a generic EPR system we will outline the architecture and describe the standards       and methods used. Subsequently we describe the implementation and the problems      encountered. In the discussion, we will go into the advantages and disadvantages       of the tools and techniques we have used.

PMID- 12909165   - PROBLEM: The combination of a computer-based patient record and a      decision-support system (DSS) may give physicians the decisive push they need to       accept such systems. In the PropeR-project we determine the requirements for a      generic interface between both these systems and evaluate its potential impact on      patient care. This article reports results from the first year in one of the      domains under study. It also provides background information about the project,      including design considerations and experimental approach of forthcoming years.      PURPOSE: The objectives of the first year were to determine bottlenecks of the      current situation and to determine expected improvements and conditions for     implementation of a future situation with computer support. METHODS: These topics      were investigated in general by literature review and in the local situation by a      requirements analysis. For the analysis we used a combination of observation,      interviews, and patient record study. For the literature survey we searched for     reviews, meta-analyses and original studies concerning experiences with      computer-based patient records and DSSs in conventional settings and in      integrated care. RESULTS: Main bottleneck was the poor use of shared patient      record and paper guidelines. Expected improvements were better protocol adherence      and communication. Conditions for implementation of computer support were a      proper system interface and adoption by the user. CONCLUSION: Our main conclusion      was that the aspect of cooperation needs more decision support than the clinical       work itself.

PMID- 12909164   - Virtual patient records (VPR) provide a means for integrated access to patient      information that may be scattered around different healthcare settings. Within      the boundaries of a health district providing all levels of care, this concept      can be implemented in a corporate Intranet environment to support longitudinal      patient care activities across the participating healthcare providers. In this      context, a VPR implementation enables autonomous healthcare providers to operate       in a cooperative working environment and apply continuity of care. Workflow      systems bring this collaboration and cooperation into effect by automatically      routing the medical information needed by authorized actors in a healthcare      process. This paper presents a VPR framework that allows integrating      geographically dispersed medical information within a health district and      enhancing collaboration and coordination of authorized workgroups by means of a      web-based workflow system. An implementation of the proposed framework is also      presented.

PMID- 12909163   - This paper aims at identifying the specific legal requirements concerning data      security and data protection of patient health data that apply to a      cross-institutional electronic patient record (EPR) and describes possible      solutions for meeting these requirements. In Germany, the legal framework for     such records provide that disclosure of patient health information to physicians       of third-party institutions is only allowed in case that it is necessary for the       joint treatment of the patient, i.e. in case of a "treatment connection". As a      first step, the functionality of a remote-access architecture was proven allowing      a one-way connection between the EPR systems of two health institutions in      Germany, which jointly treat tumor patients. Besides, a signature system model      for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of medical documents was developed      and implemented in the existing information system architecture of the University      Medical Center of Heidelberg. Especially in Germany, the legal framework for     cross-institutional EPRs is very complex and has a considerable influence on the       development and implementation of cross-institutional EPRs. However, its      introduction is thought to be valuable, since a cross-institutional EPR will      improve communication within shared care processes, and thus improve the quality       of patient care.

PMID- 12909162   - During the past few years, the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has progressively      become a gold standard for accessing, representing and exchanging information,      especially in the health care environment. This paper presents an implementation       of the use of XML for the electronic patient record (EPR) and discusses more      specifically its growing use in two areas of the EPR: first, as a format for the       exchange of structured messages, and second, as a comprehensible way of      representing patient documents. These statements rely on a 3 years experiment      conducted at the Geneva University Hospital as part of its document-centered EPR.

PMID- 12909161   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project was to design and develop a personal      electronic health record (EHR) in order to support patient empowerment and      additionally to enhance their communication and information exchange with health       professionals through this EHR. METHOD: The functionality of a personal      Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) may vary from a simple web-based interface for     interactive data entry and data review up to a much more powerful system      additionally supporting electronic data/document communication between clinical      information systems of primary care practitioners or hospitals and even reminder       based support for the empowered citizen, to actively take care of his health,      based on relevant disease management programs. It is one means to support patient      empowerment, additionally supported by tools for building a patient community.      Since storage and communication of data in an EHR comprises sensible personal      health data, each of those functions needs specific security and access      management requirements to be considered and implemented. RESULT: Clinical pilot       projects are already done or under development.

PMID- 12909160   - OBJECTIVE: Ontology in clinical domains is becoming a core research field in the       realm of medical informatics. The objective of this study is to explore the      potential role of formal concept analysis (FCA) in a context-based ontology      building support in a clinical domain (e.g. cardiovascular medicine here).      METHODOLOGY: We developed an ontology building support system that integrated an       FCA module with a natural language processing (NLP) module. The user interface of      the system was developed as a Protege-2000 JAVA tab plug-in. A collection of 368       textual discharge summaries and a standard dictionary of Japanese diagnostic      terms (MEDIS ver2.0) were used as the main knowledge sources. A preliminary      evaluation was taken to show the usefulness of the system. RESULTS: Stability was      shown on the MEDIS-based medical concept extraction with high precision. 73+/-14%      (mean+/-S.D.) of the compound medical phrases extracted were sufficiently      meaningful to form a medical concept from a clinical perspective. Also, 57.7% of       attribute implication pairs (i.e. medical concept pairs) extracted were      identified as positive from a clinical perspective. CONCLUSION: Under the      framework of our ontology building support system using FCA, the clinical experts      could reach a mass of both linguistic information and context-based knowledge      that was demonstrated as useful to support their ontology building tasks.

PMID- 12909159   - BACKGROUND: Linking administrative and clinical databases provides opportunities       for richer studies to improve healthcare, but linkage may require sophisticated      algorithms. Linking US Medicare data with large databases used for everyday      clinical practice is seldom described in detail in medical literature.      OBJECTIVES: Test a deterministic method of linking data from a local electronic      medical records system to Medicare data, and report specific details of the      algorithm used as well as lessons learned from the linkage process. SUBJECTS:      Medicare beneficiaries with medical encounters in selected Indiana counties in      the 5-year period ending in 1999. RESULTS: For 6,388 beneficiaries with Medicare       data indicating inpatient encounters in the system, 98% had links to the clinical      database. Of 7,231 patients hospitalized and registered in the local clinical      system, 86% contained a link to Medicare data, and 69% contained a link even      without using Social security number (SSN) as an identifier. Medicare data that      conflicted with local hospital records by indicating no local hospitalization      occurred in 1.8%. More than 2,000 claims contained hospital identifiers that did       not exist in the hospital codebook. CONCLUSIONS: Details of a practical,      deterministic method of linking Medicare claims to a large electronic records      system have been applied and described. Most records were linked without SSN. A      variety of inconsistencies were found and these, along with missing or incomplete      data, can influence linking. Integrity of specific variables must be assessed      carefully.

PMID- 12909158   - We developed an Integrated Medical Image Database and Retrieval System (INIS) for     easy access by medical staff. The INIS mainly consisted of four parts: specific      servers to save medical images from multi-vendor modalities of CT, MRI, CR, ECG      and endoscopy; an integrated image database (DB) server to save various kinds of       images in a DICOM format; a Web application server to connect clients to the      integrated image DB and the Web browser terminals connected to an HIS system. The      INIS provided a common screen design to retrieve CT, MRI, CR, endoscopic and ECG       images, and radiological reports, which would allow doctors to retrieve      radiological images and corresponding reports, or ECG images of a patient      simultaneously on a screen. Doctors working in internal medicine on average      accessed information 492 times a month. Doctors working in cardiological and      gastroenterological accessed information 308 times a month. Using the INIS,      medical staff could browse all or parts of a patient's medical images and      reports.

PMID- 12909157   - BACKGROUND: Given the potential for electronic medical records (EMRs) to      influence every aspect of health care, there has been surprisingly little      rigorous research applied to this emerging health technology. An initial phase of      the COMPETE (computerization of medical practices for the enhancement of      therapeutic efficacy) program, which investigates the impact of EMRs and      electronic decision support on efficiency, quality of care and privacy concerns,       developed and used a rigorous approach to EMR selection. METHODS: A      multidisciplinary team with clinical, technical and research expertise led an      eight-stage evaluation process with direct input from potential clinical users at      each stage. An iterative sequence of review of EMR specifications and features,      live product demonstrations, site visits, and negotiations with vendors led to a       progressive narrowing of the field of eligible EMR systems. Final scoring was      based on three main themes of clinical usability, data quality and vendor     maturity issues. RESULTS: The field of eligible EMR systems was relatively easily      narrowed to a few finalists. Determination of the important strengths and      weaknesses of these systems' usability, data extraction capabilities and vendor     viability, required the full suite of evaluation steps. Preferences varied      amongst clinicians and between clinicians and technical specialists, particularly      regarding the importance of user interface versus database issues. However, the      final scoring process showed consensus amongst clinical and technical experts.      CONCLUSION: A rigorous, multidisciplinary process is useful in EMR selection.      While prolonged and laborious, it is transparent, enhances buy in and realism of       expectations by multiple potential users and IT support staff and may, therefore,      improve the ultimate success of any EMR implementation project.

PMID- 12909156   - The burgeoning of consumer health informatics and virtual health care can help      people improve their health. However, little is known about individuals'      reactions to such systems. We conducted an evaluation of the telephone-linked      care (TLC) system, a computer-based telecommunications system, that functions as       an at home monitor, educator, and counselor for patients with chronic health      conditions. Our multimethod assessment of individuals' reactions to using TLC      included both quantitative and qualitative methods. Ethnographic in-depth      open-ended interviews indicated more subtle and surprising reactions to TLC than       the overall positive responses from surveys: individuals formed personal      relationships with this technology. This relationship formation suggests that TLC      designers may have been successful in their attempts to emulate a conversation      with a human being. Our study adds to evidence that technology can serve as a      projective device for peoples' values and psychological issues. Both designers      and users project values and goals onto computer-based technologies and take on      different identities through it. Different groups of users, therefore, may see      the same technology differently. People also form relationships with      technologies, as they did with TLC. These findings, as well as implications for     system design and health outcomes, need to be explored in additional studies.

PMID- 12909155   - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the physician      order-entry system (POE) could increase the outpatient and inpatient revenue of      hospitals. METHOD: We analyzed the inpatient and outpatient revenue data of all      general hospitals (212) in South Korea obtained from the Korean National Health      Insurance Corporation (KNHIC) during the period from 1996 to 1999 using the mixed      model for repeated measure data. RESULTS: Analysis of the 4-years' panel data      showed that both outpatient and inpatient revenues increased significantly after       POE introduction. The hospital characteristics significantly influencing      inpatient revenue were the number of beds, number of physicians and the tertiary       status of a hospital; whereas those for outpatient revenue were the number of      beds, number of physicians, the private status of a hospital, the tertiary status      of a hospital and the urban status of a hospital. CONCLUSION: The revenues from      both outpatients and inpatients were found to be increased after the introduction      of the POE, while controlling for population size, competition, income, hospital       location, hospital size, tertiary status and public status.

PMID- 12909154   - We propose a computer system called Cellsecu that maintains the anonymity and the      confidentiality of each cell containing sensitive information in medical      database. Cellsecu attains this by automatically removing, generalizing, and      expanding information. It is designed to enhance data privacy protection so a      data warehouse can automatically handle queries. In most cases, health      organizations collect medical data with explicit identifiers, such as name,      address and phone number. Simply removing all explicit identifiers prior to      release of the data is not enough to preserve the data confidentiality. Remaining      data can be used to re-identify individuals by linking or matching the data to      other database, or by looking at unique characteristics found in the database. A       formal model based on Modal logic is the theoretical foundation of Cellsecu. As      well, a new confidentiality criteria called "non-uniqueness" is defined and      implemented. We believe modeling this problem formally can clarify the issue as      well as clearly identify the boundary of current technology. Base on our     preliminary performance evaluation, the confidentiality check module and the      confidentiality enhancing module only slightly degrade system performance.

PMID- 12909153   - OBJECTIVES: To determine information seeking behavior of physicians. DATA      SOURCES: Systematic review of 19 studies that described information seeking      behavior in a number of different settings using differing methodologies.      Analysis was limited to quantitative studies describing sources of information      sought by physicians. RESULTS: Investigators have used questionnaires, interviews      and observation to identify the information seeking behavior of clinicians. The      results were mainly obtained from trials in the United States and showed a wide      variation in primary information sources used by physicians. The most frequent      source for information used are text sources, second is asking colleagues and      only one study found electronic databases to be the primary resource. Physician's      desk reference is the commonest cited printed resource. Convenience of access,      habit, reliability, high quality, speed of use, and applicability makes      information seeking likely to be successful and to occur. The lack of time to      search, the huge amount of material, forgetfulness, the belief that there is      likely to be no answer, and the lack of urgency all hinder the process of      answering questions. CONCLUSIONS: The wide variation in information seeking      behavior implies a need for further categorization of information need and      information sources. Careful planning of information delivery to physicians is      required to enable them to keep up to date and to improve knowledge transfer.

PMID- 12909152   - The objective of the study was to assess the use of a computer toxicology      database/clinical decision aid by clinical practitioners. The study investigated       the sources that Emergency Department (ED) personnel use to obtain toxicology      information and performed a quality audit of the current database. A      questionnaire survey of ED staff was used in departments with access to the New      Zealand Poisons Centre Substance Database (NZSD), a toxicology CD ROM computer     database. Outcome measures were reported use of alternative data sources when      managing clinical toxicology presentations and the qualities of the NZSD.      Computer databases are commonly used for the management of clinical toxicology      cases and the toxicology computer database/clinical decision aid studied is well       accepted and used in Emergency Medicine practice. The users of the NZSD assessed       the usability and quality of the information of the database.

PMID- 12810134   - Patient empowerment is a philosophy of health care that proceeds from the      perspective that optimal outcomes of health care interventions are achieved when       patients become active participants in the health care process. Under a patient      empowerment philosophy, patients and clinicians jointly set goals, select      interventions, and assess outcomes according to mutually-defined parameters.      Employing patient empowerment as an information systems design philosophy leads      to creation of computerized information resources, management systems and      telehealth innovations in a manner that insures patients' abilities to      participate as full partners in health care. Discussions in the track 3      discussion group led to refinement of the concept from patient empowerment to      patient engagement. This report reflects the discussions by the participants.

PMID- 12810131   - BACKGROUND: Quality management in health care services has not been as successful      as in other industries. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential contribution of an      on-line incident reporting system (OIRS) and of an electronic patient record      (EPR) system to quality management in hospitals. METHODS: The two approaches are       being implemented in Osaka University Hospital. RESULTS: Analysis of the early      use of the on-line reporting system indicates that this qualitative approach has       been effective to avoid adverse medical events. The quantitative methodology with      the EPR is still in the phase of developing. CONCLUSION: Direct data entry by      medical staff and an EPR based on dynamic templates and a dynamic problem      oriented approach could be useful for building clinical data repositories that      can support clinical quality management.

PMID- 12810130   - PURPOSE: This report describes an ongoing transition from the HELP Hospital      Information System to HELP II, a replacement Health Information System built to      manage clinical information captured in a variety of medical settings. The focus       of the article is on the medical decision support provided by this system and      studied by researchers at the University of Utah and Intermountain Health Care      (IHC), a large health care organization in Utah, for many years. METHODS: Select       success features of the original HELP system's decision support environment are      identified and lessons learned are related. Plans for transferring these features      to HELP II are discussed. RESULTS: The article focuses on four features: (1) the       importance of easy access to patient data essential for decision support, (2) the      commitment to continued measurement and revision of both the logic and the      interventional strategy in a decision support application, (3) experience with      data mining as a tool for developing decision support tools, and (4) the role of       clinical reports in supporting the decision making process.

PMID- 12810129   - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of explicit attention to formal issues of      'measurement' in studies examining outcomes of the deployment of clinical      information systems. METHODS: A structured literature review identified 27      published studies reporting quantitative outcomes including attitudes, clinician       behavior, quality of care, and cost of care. These studies were analyzed for     types of outcome reported, evidence of 'reuse' of measurement methodology, and      evidence of formal study of the reliability and validity of these measures.      RESULTS: The 27 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were published between      1976 and 2002. Several of the studies addressed multiple outcome types. Nine      examined clinician attitudes; 22 examined health care behaviors; 15 examined      patient health status/quality of care; and four examined economic indicators.      There were eight examples of reuse of measurement methods, five of which      represented reuse within a single research group. Reliability indices were      reported in three studies. There were no reported validity indices. CONCLUSION:      Based on this sample of studies, specific attention to issues of measurement is      sparse in outcome studies of deployed clinical information systems. As such,      medical informatics does not appear to be on a par with more mature sciences in      its approaches to measurement of key outcome variables.

PMID- 12810128   - AIMS: Evaluating large scale health information systems (HIS) such as hospital      systems can be difficult. This article discusses the reasons we need to evaluate       these systems and a range of appropriate methods to carry out evaluations. It is       written in non-technical language to assist health policy makers and others      commissioning or implementing such systems, with references and a web site      containing information for those wishing more detail      (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/kmc/evaluation/index.html). METHODS: A variety of questions      relevant to HIS and qualitative and quantitative methods ranging from simple      before-after to controlled before-after and fully randomised designs, are      discussed. A running example--evaluating the impact of an order communications      system on lab requests--is used to illustrate the potential problems, and how      they can be resolved. RESULTS: The main types of biases affecting impact studies       and methods to reduce them are described. The article then discusses some      trade-offs between the low cost, easily conducted before-after study with its      unreliable results versus the more complex, expensive but much more rigorous      randomised trial. CONCLUSIONS: As would be expected, the correct methods to      evaluate depend not on what technology is being evaluated--whether an information      system or a drug--but on the questions the study is designed to answer, and how      reliable the answers must be. Only those commissioning an evaluation study can      decide these.

PMID- 12810127   - OBJECTIVE: To articulate important lessons learned during a study to identify      success factors for implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE) in      inpatient and outpatient settings. DESIGN: Qualitative study by a      multidisciplinary team using data from observation, focus groups, and both formal      and informal interviews. Data were analyzed using a grounded approach to develop       a taxonomy of patterns and themes from the transcripts and field notes. RESULTS:       The theme we call Special People is explored here in detail. A taxonomy of types       of Special People includes administrative leaders, clinical leaders (champions,      opinion leaders, and curmudgeons), and bridgers or support staff who interface      directly with users. CONCLUSION: The recognition and nurturing of Special People       should be among the highest priorities of those implementing computerized      physician order entry. Their education and training must be a goal of teaching      programs in health administration and medical informatics.

PMID- 12810126   - The recognition that restructuring care processes is central to effective and      efficient health care will result in the emergence of process-oriented electronic      patient records (EPRs). How will these technologies come into being? Within      informatics, it is often stated that to informate something, we should first      model it. This paper queries whether a detailed modeling of work processes and      data flows is the primary step that needs to be completed before such EPRs can be      developed or tailored. Building upon a sociotechnical understanding of ICT      development, we argue for a reinterpretation of 'models' in such development      processes. We do so through a reverse engineering of parts of the paper-based      medical record, which has received little attention in medical informatics. In      process-oriented EPR design, we argue, modeling should not be conceived as the      crucial first step in this design, but rather as an intervention in the      organizational change-processes that constitute proper ICT development.

PMID- 12810125   - OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a framework for the design of interactions between      human and computational agents working in organisations, mediation by      technological systems. DESIGN: The design of interactions within an organisation       is viewed from the point of view, not of the technology mediating the new      interaction, but of the human and computational agents who interact with each      other. RESULTS: Understanding the limits to individual agent resources permits an      analysis of the impact that a new interaction will have in a given setting. When       we look beyond simple interaction settings, we can use the notion of interaction       equilibria to predict the impact of new information and communication      technologies within an organisation. Economic supply and demand curves, for     example, may allow us to make both qualitative and quantitative predictions about      technological adoption of communication systems. CONCLUSION: Rather than focusing      solely on characteristics of individual technologies, or psychological and social      issues, these can be combined to explain the overall decisions that individuals      make when using technologies. Without necessarily understanding all the local      decision criteria used by any individual, we can make robust predictions about      how a group as a whole will interact.

PMID- 12810124   - Information systems fail for a number of reasons. Several failure reasons include      communication, complexity, organization, technology, and leadership. Failure can       be outlined in four major categories: technical shortcomings, project management       shortcomings, organizational issues, and the continuing information explosion.      Change management is the process of assisting individuals and organizations in      passing from an old way of doing things to a new way of doing things. Change      management starts early in a technical process, as the need for making major     changes starts at the conceptual level. This paper briefly covers the people side      of implementing new information systems, and describes resistance to change and      various strategies to manage technological change.

PMID- 12810123   - BACKGROUND: Patients are demanding a bigger role in the management of their own      health and health care. METHODS: The Dutch Federation of Patient and Consumer     Organizations (NPCF) has initiated several projects in this area. One project      started in 2001 and aims at contributing to the development of a nation-wide EPR       system. RESULTS: the NPCF participates in the National Institute for the Care      Sector (NICTIZ). The NPCF plays an important role in defining the requirements      regarding authorization and security of the EPR as well as for the legal      framework in which optimal use can be made of the EPR. NPCF strongly promotes an       active role of NICTIZ in developing a master plan for the EPR and an active role       in its implementation. CONCLUSION: Patients and their organizations have to play       an active role in designing and implementation of an ICT infrastructure for     health care and in particular of the EPR.

PMID- 12810122   - OBJECTIVE: The problems with access to care and the special needs for educational      outreach for disadvantage or vulnerable populations of patients require      innovation. This paper describes Baby CareLink use of information technology to      support communication, consultation, and collaboration among colleagues as well      as with patients, their families, and community resources. METHODS: In response      to the educational, emotional and communication needs of parents of premature      infants and the clinicians who care for the infants and support the families, we       developed Baby CareLink, a secure collaborative environment. Baby CareLink      provides a nurturing environment where parents, even though remote from the      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, can actively participate in decisions surrounding      their baby's care. RESULTS: In a southeastern hospital serving a mostly Medicaid       population in a rural setting, more than 300 parents have used Baby CareLink more      than 11000 times during the past year. Despite the common wisdom that Medicaid      families do not have access to the Internet, approximately 85% of the parents      access Baby CareLink from home, at work, from the library or other public access       point. The median use of Baby CareLinks from outside the hospital by parents is      17 separate sessions. In a city hospital in the midwestern US which exclusively      serves a Medicaid population, experience has been equally encouraging. More than       70 parents have initiated more than 600 secure sessions with Baby CareLink. In      contrast to the rural hospital, only 35% of sessions have been initiated outside       the hospital. DISCUSSION: Experience with Baby CareLink suggests that families      from all walks of life will use and benefit from collaborative tools that keep      them informed and involved in the care of their children. The most significant      barrier to wider deployment is bandwidth limitations into the homes of most      families. The care of premature infants is a great example of an area where      medical knowledge and ability has grown dramatically, and where information and      communication technology holds enormous potential.

PMID- 12810121   - 'Open Source' is a 20-40 year old approach to licensing and distributing software      that has recently burst into public view. Against conventional wisdom this      approach has been wildly successful in the general software market--probably      because the openness lets programmers the world over obtain, critique, use, and      build upon the source code without licensing fees. Linux, a UNIX-like operating      system, is the best known success. But computer scientists at the University of      California, Berkeley began the tradition of software sharing in the mid 1970s      with BSD UNIX and distributed the major internet network protocols as source code      without a fee. Medical informatics has its own history of Open Source      distribution: Massachusetts General's COSTAR and the Veterans Administration's      VISTA software have been distributed as source code at no cost for decades.      Bioinformatics, our sister field, has embraced the Open Source movement and      developed rich libraries of open-source software. Open Source has now gained a      tiny foothold in health care (OSCAR GEHR, OpenEMed). Medical informatics      researchers and funding agencies should support and nurture this movement. In a      world where open-source modules were integrated into operational health care      systems, informatics researchers would have real world niches into which they      could engraft and test their software inventions. This could produce a burst of      innovation that would help solve the many problems of the health care system. We       at the Regenstrief Institute are doing our part by moving all of our development       to the open-source model.

PMID- 12810120   - INTRODUCTION: Detailed clinical models are necessary to exchange medical data      between heterogeneous computer systems and to maintain consistency in a      longitudinal electronic medical record system. At Intermountain Health Care      (IHC), we have a history of designing detailed clinical models. The purpose of      this paper is to share our experience and the lessons we have learned over the      last 5 years. DESIGN: IHC's newest model is implemented using eXtensible Markup      Language (XML) Schema as the formalism, and conforms to the Health Level Seven      (HL7) version 3 data types. The centerpiece of the new strategy is the Clinical      Event Model, which is a flexible name-value pair data structure that is tightly      linked to a coded terminology. DISCUSSION: We describe IHC's third-generation      strategy for representing and implementing detailed clinical models, and discuss       the reasons for this design.

PMID- 12810119   - The Veterans Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has      a long, successful, and interesting history of using information technology to      meet its mission. Each medical center is computerized to a degree that surprises       the uninitiated. For example, medical documentation and ordering are computerized      at every facility. A sophisticated national infrastructure has been developed to       replicate, support, and evolve single-center successes. With advances in      inter-facility networking, data sharing, and specialized central support and      technical tools, VistA is becoming a single, highly scalable national health      information system (HIS) solution. In this paper, we present an historical      overview of VistA's development, describe its current functionality, and discuss       its emergence as a national-scale hospital information system.

PMID- 12810118   - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate how a transition to an open hospital information      system architecture can help foster stronger collaborations between      computer-based clinical tools and the network of care process stakeholders.      METHODS: Description of two evolution strategies towards an open, component-based      architecture: the vertical decomposition of a monolithic system, and the      transversal integration of foundation components such as terminology servers,      documentation management, prescription, scheduling, workflow and notification      engines. CONCLUSION: The progressive migration of production clinical systems      towards a component-based architecture is feasible at a reasonable cost and leads      to substantial benefits in terms of user acceptance through participative design       and collaborative maintenance of knowledge bases, as well as improved ability to       evolve, scale and share individual components. A taxonomy of the components of a       health information system and their interactions should be developed to realize      the collaborative potential of a marketplace of interoperable components.

PMID- 12810117   - OBJECTIVES: The opening of the Georges Pompidou University Hospital (HEGP) in      southwest Paris from the merging of three aging facilities was the opportunity to      conceive and deploy a brand new clinical information system (CIS) based on a      component-based approach. This paper describes the process of selection of the      business components, the main functions currently in use, and the technical      infrastructure that proved necessary. METHODS: The HEGP CIS features generic and       healthcare-related components. The generic components include a reference      manager, a security manager, a document manager, a Corba bus, and various      mediation and supervision tools. The healthcare-related components include the      patient, healthcare record, act management, and resource scheduler components.      RESULTS: Major functions of CIS were operational at the opening of the hospital      in July 2000. Two years later, the unique patient record and the provider order     entry system were used in 96% of the concerned healthcare units. Sixty-five      percent of the biological orders and 55% of the imaging orders were directly      entered by the physicians. Access to investigation results including on-line      availability of images is used by physicians in 100% of the units. DISCUSSION AND      CONCLUSION: A component-based approach was found to be high-performing and      cost-effective for the design and deployment of HEGP CIS.

PMID- 12810116   - OBJECTIVES: To present a summary of the state of the art in Health Information      Systems (HIS), as discussed during the Heidelberg HIS Working Group Conference,      and to examine possible strategies for continuous improvement of the field.      METHODS: The state of the art in HIS is briefly described, and the historical      trends are examined that emerge from a review of the previous HIS Working Group      conferences. To extrapolate from those trends and suggest possible new      directions, we consider whether perceived difficulties in the diffusion of HIS      systems are simply a product of technological factors, or whether fundamental      social factors have been ignored. RESULTS: The experience with HIS environments      is 'reasonably good' but not excellent, and true HIS success stories are not      common. One of the apparent difficulties is that the typical HIS does not regard       communication among clinical users as its core mission, even though repeated      studies of information needs and practice patterns show that communication is the      leading cost in today's health care environment. It is suggested that progress in      the HIS arena will benefit from increased emphasis on the social aspects of      health care, and better integration of diverse data to promote the organizational      communication and workflow. Improvements could also come from a change to a      highly participatory and evolutionary software engineering process, focusing on      communication behavior and co-operative work practices. CONCLUSIONS: Future HIS      development should view provider-provider and provider-patient communication as a      core function, and incorporate features such as seamless support and tracking of       communication, automatic gathering and presentation of data from multiple      sources, data collection in atomic units by the most qualified provider, and      integrated management, resource utilization, and tracking. The steps towards HIS       that support these features might be smaller than generally suspected, once the      appropriate changes in the reference point have been made.

PMID- 12810115   - PURPOSE: To address issues of importance in 1994 and what has happened in those      issues. METHODS: A number of questions and issues will be examined. Were we right      in our focus at that time and what did we miss? What has happened that perhaps      changed our perspectives and philosophies? Has the need changed? Is the model of       fading boundaries a correct one, and how far have we gone in realizing a      communication system in dealing with those boundaries? What progress have we made      internationally on these issues? How are we working internationally to solve      these problems? RESULTS: The fifth working conference relating to hospital      information systems (HIS) was held in Durham, North Carolina in August 1994. The       Institute of Medicine publication The Computer-based Patient Record: An Essential      Technology for Health Care had been published in 1991 and had begun influencing      thinking and direction for clinical information systems. The difference between      and relationship of HIS and Computer-based Patients Records was the topic of much      discussion and debate. The 1994 conference strongly recognized the need for     standards specifically for data exchange, unique patient identifier, data      definitions and common clinical data sets and for clinical terminology.      Interconnectivity and interoperability were identified as separate but related      problems to be solved. Technology was not considered to be a barrier, and      projections for bandwidth to meet data dissemination requirements were favorable.      In the 7 years after the Durham conference, many things have changed      dramatically. Progress has been made in a number of areas, and some of the      projections have been realized. However, it is surprising to note what areas      still remain problems, particularly noting what problems have been worked on      without success and what problems have not even been addressed. It is interesting      to speculate that if the Durham conference was repeated today, would it be      accepted as a current event?

PMID- 12810114   - The objective of this paper is to consider the recommendations and expectations      of the IMIA WG10 working conferences at Nijmegen (1988) and Gottingen (1991) from      the present perspective. The methods: the original task description of WG10 is      considered and the main items during the Nijmegen and Gottingen working      conferences are addressed. The design and use of a HIS are compared by those for       a ship. The results: the tasks of WG10 have only partially been completed.      However, for several items significant progress has been made. The conclusions:      the recommendations of the earlier conferences are to a large extent still valid.      A scientific foundation for HIS development has not yet been created, in this      respect HIS design and development compares unfavourably with shipbuilding. The      choice has to be made: either we consider HIS development as an art or we give      priority to the development of a Science of Health Information Processing (SHIP)       to found the HIS development.

PMID- 12810113   - PURPOSE: To assess progress made in hospital information systems (HIS) since      1979, when the forerunner of the International Medical Informatics Association      Working Group on HIS first met. METHODS: A review of the recommendations made in       1979 identified core concerns, which were analyzed in light of the state of the      art in 2002. RESULTS: Despite significant changes over the years, the underlying       concerns identified in 1979 are still valid today. In 2002 as in 1979, HIS must      be integrated into the hospital's organizational structure; financial and      economic benefits depend upon using technology as an enabler of improved clinical      outcomes; and education and training remain critical to the successful use of      technology solutions. The tools available for addressing these concerns have      changed enormously. Where there were dumb terminals, there are the World Wide Web      and handheld devices. As a result, we are raising our expectations and changing      the terms of our discussions. Today the focus is shifting to patient safety,      decision support, and evidence-based practice; the concerns voiced in 1979 have      become medical informatics cornerstones. New tools and new approaches now      available can improve the quality of care. Using them appropriately requires      careful planning and education for patients as well as healthcare professionals.

PMID- 12706184   - This paper presents a new category of decision-support tools that builds on      today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and On-Line Analytical Processing      (OLAP) technologies to facilitate Geographic Knowledge Discovery (GKD). This new       category, named Spatial OLAP (SOLAP), has been an R&D topic for about 5 years in       a few university labs and is now being implemented by early adopters in different      fields, including public health where it provides numerous advantages. In this      paper, we present an example of a SOLAP application in the field of environmental      health: the ICEM-SE project. After having presented this example, we describe the      design of this system and explain how it provides fast and easy access to the      detailed and aggregated data that are needed for GKD and decision-making in      public health. The SOLAP concept is also described and a comparison is made with       traditional GIS applications.

PMID- 12706183   - We describe an interface and architecture for ad hoc temporal query of TrialDB, a      clinical study data management system (CSDMS). A clinical study focuses primarily      on the effect of therapy on a group of patients, who have individually enrolled      in a study at different times. Relative times (chronological offsets from the      time of enrollment) are therefore more useful than absolute times when      collectively describing therapeutic or adverse events. For logistic reasons,      study parameter values are typically recorded at fixed relative times ('study      events'), which serve as time-stamps and can be used by CSDMS temporal query      algorithms to simplify temporal computations. The entity-attribute-value model of      clinical data storage, used by both CSDMSs and clinical patient record systems,      complicates temporal query. To apply temporal operators, data for parameters of      interest must first be transiently converted into conventional relational form,      with one column per parameter.

PMID- 12706182   - Health level 7 (HL7) is the standard of electronic data interchange in the health      domain. We have developed a web-based message generation and validation system      for testing the message format of the data exchange among hospitals and health      organizations. Compared with other existing ones, this system has incorporated      several novel functions that optimize medical data exchange and helps medical      students in learning HL7 messages. When receiving HL7 message from another system      with the hypertext transmission protocol or accepting an uploaded HL7 message      file, the system shows the validation result through a web browser. In this      platform, users may input and edit medical data on-line to test and generate      standard HL7 messages. The system supports various data formats and is capable of      transforming HL7 messages between the standard delimiter format and the      extensible markup language format. This system has been successfully passed our     system evaluation among 139 student users for HL7 training. Most of the users      agreed that the system is helpful for medical data exchange.

PMID- 12706181   - There have been an increasing number of large research consortia in recent years       funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to facilitate multi-disciplinary,      multi-institutional cancer research. Some of these consortia have central data      collection plans similar to a multi-center clinical trial whereas others plan to       store data locally and pool or share the data at a later date. Regardless of the       goal of the consortium, there is a need to standardize the way certain data are      collected and stored, transferred, or reported across the institutions involved.       This communication is a report of the process and current status of the      development of common data elements (CDEs) by the Early Detection Research      Network (EDRN). The development of the CDEs involved several stages with each      stage requiring input from multi-disciplinary experts in oncology, epidemiology,       biostatistics, pathology, informatics, and study coordination. An effort was made      to be consistent with other consortia developing similar CDEs and to follow data       standards when available. Initial focus was on identifying the minimum data that       would be necessary to collect on all EDRN study participants and EDRN specimens.       There are currently CDEs in the development or pilot phase for eight different      organ sites and 13 different types of specimen procurements and plans to develop       CDEs for 12 or more additional types of specimens.

PMID- 12706180   - INTRODUCTION: Improving outpatient resource utilization significantly enhances      the efficiency of healthcare organizations. Substantial number of walk-in      patients (average of 72% in our study) to outpatient services is a universal      characteristic of Taiwan's healthcare organizations. Consequently, scheduling      becomes extremely complicated and important. Selecting the right scheduling      alternative, a healthcare organization can markedly improve operating efficiency       of outpatient resources. OBJECTIVE: This research applied simulation methodology       to analyze several scheduling solutions and found that setting the appropriate      arrival time interval for preregistered patients significantly impacts queuing      problems in outpatient services. METHOD: Using established simulation models, the      effects of various scheduling policies on patients' throughput time and waiting      times were revealed. Under alternative model A, the first 20 numbers are reserved      for scheduled patients; after that, only even numbers are offered for scheduled      ones. Odd numbers after 20 are left for walk-ins. Under alternative model B,      front numbers were assigned to scheduled patients successively. The later numbers      were left for walk-ins. Alternative model C assigned scheduled patients with even      numbers and walk-ins with odd numbers in sequence. Finally, alternative model D      was designed to examine the optimal scheduled time interval by conducting the      model with different scheduled time intervals such as 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 min.      RESULT: The alternative sequence (alternative model C-assigning even numbers for       scheduled patients and odd numbers for walk-in patients, or vice versa)      significantly has the least throughput time (average: 34.9 min vs 55.2, 56.2, and      46.2 min) and waiting times (average: 14.7 min vs 34.9, 35.8, and 25.8 min) for     walk-in patients compared with other registration strategies. Scheduling the      appointments with flexible time interval (alternative model D) has the least      throughput time (average: 24.2 min vs 28.4, 28.2, and 37.2 min) and waiting times      (average: 8.0 min vs 12.5, 12.3, and 20.5 min) for scheduled patients compared      with other registration strategies. CONCLUSION: The findings of this research      could be applied possibly to any outpatient clinic with mixed-registration-type      (walk-in and scheduled), particularly which accounts for high percentage of      walk-in patients.

PMID- 12706179   - OBJECTIVE: In this study we sought to develop a comparative cost evaluation      between conventional and new media, e.g. web, mobile communication technology and      digital television, and near patient testing supported anticoagulant (ac)      treatment follow-up in a primary health care setting. METHOD: The comparison was       done for two patient groups, self-care and home-care patients, on oral ac      treatment in the primary health care centre of the rural and sparsely populated      municipality of Ikaalinen. In practise case analysis was used to develop cost      functions from collected economic data, which were analysed to determine the      break-even point in total cost between conventional and new media supported      follow-up for the two patient groups. RESULTS: In the home-care setting the      break-even point is 14 patients; in the self-care setting new media supported      follow-up is always more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The results illustrate that       the use of new media and near patient testing in ac treatment follow-up brings      about an economic benefit even with a small number of patients in the Ikaalinen      setting. However, the sensitivity of break-even to perturbations in the      individual costs of the used economic models remains high. Still, when the      economic benefits are considered together with the clinical and practical      benefits shown to result from self-testing, self-management and use of new media       technologies the new service models can be said to provide noticeable benefits      both in terms of quality of care and economics in our specific setting.

PMID- 12706178   - The log analysis of a web site can be used to guide performance improvement. Log       analysis identifies which resources on a website are often accessed and those      that are not. A log analysis can provide cost justification for a corporate web      presence. We describe the log analysis of a large integrated delivery system in      New York City from its launch May 1, 2001, through April 30, 2002. During this      first year there were 428753 sessions with 1322153 page views. An analysis of      page views, exclusive of the default home page, revealed that the pages most      frequently visited were related to job opportunities (22.4%, 120086 of 428753),      general information ('About') (8.5%, 45355), St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan      (8.3%, 44630), graduate medical education and allied health (8.1%, 43317),      facilities (7.2%, 38677), web site search (6.4%, 34322), and physician finder     (4.3%, 22910). The web site facilitated 1,980 online job applications. Health      information received 15356 page views from 1793 visits. The re-design of the site      for year 2 promoted the more frequently selected links, flattened the      navigational architecture, and enabled access to all web pages within two to      three mouse clicks of the home page. Lessons learned in the process of developing      and maintaing a health care organization web site are shared in the case study.

PMID- 12706177   - The purpose of our study was to evaluate how e-mail is currently used between      physicians and patients in an integrated delivery system, and to identify      developments that might promote increased use of this form of communication. A      paper-based survey questionnaire was administered to 94 primary care physicians.       We evaluated the role e-mail currently plays in a physician's typical work day,      physician views on the impact of e-mail on phone use and the barriers to      increasing the use of e-mail with patients. 76% of physicians surveyed responded.      All respondents currently use e-mail. Close to 75% of physicians use e-mail with       their patients, but the vast majority do so with only 1-5% of those patients. 50%      of physicians believe that up to 25% of their patients would send e-mail to them       if given the option, with an additional 37% believing that between 25% and 50% of      patients would value this option. The main reported barriers to physician-patient      e-mail related to workload, security and payment. Our survey findings indicate      that with adequate pre-screening, triage, and reimbursement mechanisms physicians      would be open to substantially increasing e-mail communication with patients.

PMID- 12485704   - BACKGROUND: The Emerging Infections Network is a mature electronic network that      links Public Health professionals in the Asia Pacific through regular e-mail      bulletins and an extensive Web site (http://www.apec.org/infectious). Emerging      infections is a new area of study; learning materials help foster education. Our       objective is to quantify the response of the network to the introduction of      distance-learning materials on the Web site. METHODS: Distance-learning      materials, developed by the University of Washington School of Public Health,      were field tested and launched on the site. Publicity was carried out prior to      the launch of the materials. Access was tracked prospectively using server counts      of page downloads. RESULTS: Web access increased substantially during the month      after the materials were launched, especially among Asia based computers. The      effect was isolated to the distance-learning pages, and not general to the site.       CONCLUSIONS: This Web site appears to be responsive to the advertisement and to      the materials. Prospective Web-site monitoring proved useful.

PMID- 12485703   - OBJECTIVES: This paper evaluates a semi-automatic segmentation procedure to      enhance utilizing atlas based treatment plans. For this application, it is      crucial to provide a collection of 'reference' organs, restorable from the atlas       so that they closely match those of the current patient. To enable assembling      representative organs, we developed a semi-automatic procedure using an active      contour method. METHOD: The 3D organ volume was identified by defining contours      on individual slices. The initial organ contours were matched to patient volume      data sets and then superimposed on them. These starting contours were then      adjusted and refined to rapidly find the organ outline of the given patient.      Performance was evaluated by contouring organs of different size, shape      complexity, and proximity to surrounding structures. We used representative      organs defined on CT volumes obtained from 12 patients and compared the resulting      outlines to those drawn by a radiologist. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found      between the area measures of the delineated liver (r = 0.992), lung (r = 0.996)      and spinal cord (r = 0.81), obtained by both segmentation techniques. A paired      Student's t-test showed no statistical difference between the two techniques      regarding the liver and spinal cord (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This method could be       used to form 'standard' organs, which would form part of a whole body atlas (WBA)      database for radiation treatment plans as well as to match atlas organs to new      patient data.

PMID- 12485702   - The application of information technology (IT) in health care has the potential      to transform the delivery of care, as well as the health care work environment,      by streamlining processes, making procedures more accurate and efficient, and      reducing the risk of human error. For nurses, a major aspect of this      transformation is the refocusing of their work on direct patient care and away      from being a conduit of information and communication among departments. Several       of the technologies discussed, such as physician order entry and bar code      technology, have existed for years as standalone systems. Many others are just      being developed and are being integrated into complex clinical information      systems (CISs) with clinical decision support at their core. While early      evaluation of these systems shows positive outcome measurements, financial,      technical, and organizational hurdles to widespread implementation still remain.       One major issue is defining the role nurses, themselves, will play in the      selection and implementation of these systems as they become more steeped in the       knowledge of nursing informatics. Other challenges revolve around issues of job      satisfaction and the attraction and retention of nursing staff in the midst of a       serious nursing shortage. Despite these concerns, it is expected that, in the      long run, the creation of an electronic work environment with systems that      integrate all functions of the health care team will positively impact      cost-effectiveness, productivity, and patient safety while helping to revitalize       nursing practice.

PMID- 12485701   - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of tissue      counter analysis to the interpretation of skin images. METHOD: Digital images      from microscopic views of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma were      classified by the use of features extracted from histogram and co-occurrence      matrix. Eighty cases were sampled and split into a training set and a test set.      The images were dissected in square elements and the different features were      calculated for each element. The classification was done by classification and      regression trees (CART) analysis. In the CART procedure, the square elements were      split into disjunctive nodes, which were characterized by a relevant subset of      the features. The classification results were indicated in the original image in       order to evaluate the performance of the procedure. RESULTS: For the learning set      and the test set there is a significant difference between benign nevi and      malignant melanoma without overlap. Discriminant analysis based on the percentage      of 'malignant elements' facilitated a correct classification of all cases.      DISCUSSION: Since no image segmentation was needed, problems related to this task      were avoided. Though wrong classification of individual elements is unavoidable      to some degree, tissue counter analysis shows a good discrimination between      benign common nevi and malignant melanoma. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, tissue      counter analysis may be a useful method for the interpretation of melanocytic      skin tumors.

PMID- 12485700   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors influencing variations in clinicians' use of an      online evidence retrieval system. SETTING: Public hospitals in New South Wales,      Australia. METHOD: Web log analysis demonstrated considerable variation in rates       of evidence use by clinicians at different hospitals. Focus groups and interviews      were held with 61 staff from three hospitals, two with high rates of use and one       with a low rate of use, to explore variation in evidence use. RESULTS:      Differences between hospitals' and professional groups' (doctors, nurses and      allied health) use of online evidence could be explained by organizational,      professional and cultural factors. These included the presence of champions,      organizational cultures which supported evidence-based practice (EBP), and      database searching skills of individual clinicians. Staff shortages, ease of      access and time taken to use the online evidence system were cited as barriers to      use at the low use site, but no objective differences in these measures were      found between the high and low use sites. CONCLUSION: Social and cultural factors      were found to be better discriminators of high and low evidence use than      technical factors.

PMID- 12467804   - Hypermedia data browsing is a mean for improving information access. However, the      overload and the heterogeneity of medical information, as well as the multitude      of possible navigational paths, turn the consultation of data into a difficult      task. We present in this paper a solution for the development of adaptive user     interfaces in a hypermedia data browsing environment. It is based on the      capitalization of the users knowledge in the decision-making process, expressed      in terms of navigational paths and of data presentation modes that are customized      to the user's preferences and practice. This capitalization offers the user a way      to automatically store and reuse the experience accumulated in browsing through      patient records. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of HEMA, a      clinical workstation prototype that we have specialized for the cardiology      domain.

PMID- 12467803   - The purpose of this overview is to examine and illustrate the feasible options      for the statistical analysis of nursing minimum data sets (NMDSs). After     explaining the need for these data collections, examples from different countries      are discussed and examples of the methods used for statistical analysis are      summarized. Distinct purposes for information uses and for the presentation of      information requires different approaches for data collection and statistical      analysis. The feasible options for the nursing minimum data set for the      Netherlands (NMDSN) have been described to illustrate the different methods      available. Six studies are discussed, illustrating their goals, data collection      methods, data analysis, and results. These studies include visualizing nursing      care by means of frequencies of nursing diagnoses and interventions, RIDIT      (relative to an identified distribution) analysis, fingerprints, and graphs from       multidimensional scaling techniques. In addition, using data sets for workload      measurement and testing of instruments is presented. The overview ends with      general recommendations for data collection and analysis of NMDSs.

PMID- 12467802   - Case-based reasoning (CBR)-driven medical diagnostic systems demand a critical      mass of up-to-date diagnostic-quality cases that depict the problem-solving      methodology of medical experts. In practical terms, procurement of CBR-compliant       cases is quite challenging, as this requires medical experts to map their     experiential knowledge to an unfamiliar computational formalism. In this paper,      we propose a novel medical knowledge acquisition approach that leverages      routinely generated electronic medical records (EMRs) as an alternate source for       CBR-compliant cases. We present a methodology to autonomously transform XML-based      EMR to specialized CBR-compliant cases for CBR-driven medical diagnostic systems.      Our multi-stage methodology features: (a) collection of heterogeneous EMR from      Internet-accessible EMR repositories via intelligent agents, (b) automated      transformation of both the structure and content of generic EMR to specialized      CBR-compliant cases, and (c) inductive estimation of the weight of each      case-defining attribute. The computational implementation of our methodology is      presented as case acquisition and transcription info-structure (CATI).

PMID- 12467801   - Developers and purchasers of controlled health terminologies require valid      mechanisms for comparing terminological systems. By Controlled Health      Vocabularies, we refer to terminologies and terminological systems designed to      represent clinical data at a granularity consistent with the practice of today's       healthcare delivery. Comprehensive criterion for the evaluation of such systems      historically have been lacking and the known criteria are inconsistently applied.      Although there are many papers which describe specific desirable features of a      controlled health vocabulary, to date there is not a consistent guide for     evaluators of terminologies to reference, which will help them compare      implementations of terminological systems on an equal footing [Methods Inf. Med.       37 (1998) 394, J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 5 (1998) 503]. This guideline serves to      fill the gap between academic enumeration of desirable terminological      characteristics and the practical implementation or rigorous evaluations which      will yield comparable data regarding the quality of one or more controlled health      vocabularies.

PMID- 12467800   - The introduction of computer-based information systems (ISs) in public health      provides enhanced possibilities for service improvements and hence also for     improvement of the population's health. Not least, new communication systems can       help in the socialization and integration process needed between the different      professions and geographical regions. Therefore, development of ISs that truly      support public health practices require that technical, cognitive, and social      issues be taken into consideration. A notable problem is to capture 'voices' of      all potential users, i.e., the viewpoints of different public health      practitioners. Failing to capture these voices will result in inefficient or even      useless systems. The aim of this study is to develop a minimal data set for     capturing users' voices on problems experienced by public health professionals in      their daily work and opinions about how these problems can be solved. The issues       of concern thus captured can be used both as the basis for formulating the      requirements of ISs for public health professionals and to create an      understanding of the use context. Further, the data can help in directing the      design to the features most important for the users.

PMID- 12467799   - This paper aims to achieve haptic reproduction and real-time visualization of a      beating heart for cardiac surgery simulation. Unlike most forgoing approaches,      the authors focus on time series datasets and propose a new framework for     interactive simulation of active tissues. The framework handles both detection      and response of collisions between a manipulator and a beating virtual heart.      Physics-based force feedback of autonomous cardiac motion is also produced based       on a stress-pressure model, which is adapted to elastic objects filled with      fluid. Time series datasets of an adult man were applied to an integrated      simulation system with a force feedback device. The system displays      multi-dimensional representation of a beating heart and provides a basic training      environment for surgical palpation. Finally, results of measurement and medical      assessment confirm the achieved quality and performance of the presented      framework.

PMID- 12467798   - Time plays an important role in medicine, both the past and the future. The      medical history of a patient represents the past, which needs to be understood by      the physician to make the right decisions. The past contains two different kinds       of information: measured data (such as blood pressure) and incidents (such as      seizures). Planning therapies, on the other hand, requires looking into the      future to a certain extent. Visual representations exist for both the past and      the future, and they are very useful for getting a better understanding of data      or a plan. This paper surveys visualization techniques for both data analysis and      planning, and compares them based on a number of criteria.

PMID- 12467797   - IT support for home health care is an expanding area within health care IT      development. Home health care differs from other in- or outpatient care delivery       forms in a number of ways, and thus, the introduction of home health care      applications must be based on a rigorous analysis of necessary requirements to      secure safe and reliable health care. This article reports early experiences from      the development of a home health care application based on emerging JAVA      technologies. A prototype application for the follow-up of diabetes patients is      presented and discussed in relation to a list of general requirements on home      health care applications.

PMID- 12467796   - As health records evolve into electronic form, increasing demand is being made to      provide patients with access to them. We sought to study the character and impact      of such access to determine how patients use such records, what cognitive effects      it has on them, and how it affects their relationship with their health care      providers. We created the Patient Clinical Information System (PatCIS) to      interface with the clinical data repository at New York Presbyterian Hospital      (NYPH) to allow patients to add to and review their medical data. We also      provided educational resources and automated advice programs. We provided access       to the system to thirteen subjects over a 36-month period and reviewed their     activities in the system's usage log. We also collected data via questionnaire      and telephone interview. We collected data for a total of 223 patient months. We       found that patients varied in their use of the system, from once a month or less       to one or more times per day. All patients primarily used the system to review      laboratory results. Both they and their physicians believed that use of the      system enhanced the patients' understanding of their conditions and improved      their communication with their physicians. There were no adverse events      encountered during the study.

PMID- 12467795   - Health delivery practices are shifting towards home care. The reasons are the      better possibilities for managing chronic care, controlling health delivery      costs, increasing quality of life and quality of health services and the distinct      possibility of predicting and thus avoiding serious complications. For the above       goals to become routine, new telemedicine and information technology (IT)      solutions need to be implemented and integrated in the health delivery scene, and      these solutions need to be assessed through evidence-based medicine in order to      provide solid proof for their usefulness. Thus, the concept of contact or call      centers has emerged as a new and viable reality in the field of IT for health and      telemedicine. In this paper we describe a generic contact center that was      designed in the context of an EU funded IST for health project with acronym      Citizen Health System (CHS). Since the generic contact center is composed by a      number of modules, we shall concentrate in the modules dealing with the      communication between the patient and the contact center using mobile      telecommunications solutions, which can act as link between the internet and the       classical computer telephony communication means. We further elaborate on the      development tools of such solutions, the interface problems we face, and on the      means to convey information from and to the patient in an efficient and medically      acceptable way. This application proves the usefulness of wireless technology in       providing health care services all around the clock and everywhere the citizen is      located, it proves the necessity for restructuring the medical knowledge for     education delivery to the patient, and it shows the virtue of interactivity by      means of using the limited, yet useful browsing capabilities of the wireless      application protocol (WAP) technology.

PMID- 12467794   - Increasing reliance is being placed on electronic medical records to support      clinical care and achieve improved quality standards. In order for clinical      information systems (CIS) to deliver excellence the data within it needs to be      complete, consistent and accurate. This capture of data is critical but forms      only part of the procedure in delivering quality health care during the      clinician-patient encounter. A number of processes are involved in this      encounter, each of which has to be performed flawlessly to deliver a perfect      outcome. This paper outlines a method of assessing the quality of these processes      involved in healthcare provision and data quality within a CIS. It proposes the      principle of Data Quality Probes (DQP) to assess the performance of the whole      encounter system. The main feature of this is the generation of a query which      clinical knowledge predicts should not retrieve any cases in a system performing       flawlessly. Any cases retrieved (which fail the DQP) indicate an error in either       data quality or clinical judgment. This approach is applied practically within      the paradigm of a UK family practice testing the hypothesis that a series DQPs      can provide a valuable method for monitoring both the data accuracy of a CIS and       the provision of quality patient care.

PMID- 12467793   - In the medical domain, different knowledge types are typically available.      Operative knowledge, collected during every day practice, and reporting expert's       skills, is stored in the hospital information system (HIS). On the other hand,      well-assessed, formalised medical knowledge is reported in textbooks and clinical      guidelines. We claim that all this heterogeneous information should be secured      and distributed, and made available to physicians in the right form, at the right      time, in order to support decision making: in our view, therefore, a decision      support system cannot be conceived as an independent tool, able to substitute the      human expert on demand, but should be integrated with the knowledge management      (KM) task. From the methodological viewpoint, case based reasoning (CBR) has      proved to be a very well suited reasoning paradigm for managing knowledge of the       operative type. On the other hand, rule based reasoning (RBR) is historically one      of the most successful approaches to deal with formalised knowledge. To take      advantage of all the available knowledge types, we propose a multi modal      reasoning (MMR) methodology, that integrates CBR and RBR, for supporting context       detection, information retrieval and decision support. Our methodology has been      successfully tested on an application in the field of diabetic patients      management.

PMID- 12467792   - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the usefulness of two models for integrating nursing      diagnosis concepts into SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT). METHODS: First, we dissected       nursing diagnosis term phrases from two source terminologies (North American      Nursing Diagnosis Association Taxonomy 1 (NANDA) and Omaha System) into the      semantic categories of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN)      categorical structure and ISO reference terminology model (RTM). Second, we      critically analyzed the similarities between the semantic links in the CEN and      ISO models and the semantic links used to formally define diagnostic concepts in       SNOMED CT. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that focus, bearer/subject of      information, and judgment were present in 100% of the NANDA and Omaha term      phrases. The Omaha term phrases contained no additional descriptors beyond those       considered mandatory in the CEN and ISO models. The comparison among the semantic      links showed that SNOMED CT currently contains all but one of the semantic links       needed to model the two source terminologies for integration. In conclusion, our       findings support the potential utility of the CEN and ISO models for integrating       nursing diagnostic concepts into SNOMED CT.

PMID- 12467791   - Representation of clinical practice guidelines in a computer-interpretable format      is a critical issue for guideline development, implementation, and evaluation. We      studied 11 types of guideline representation models that can be used to encode      guidelines in computer-interpretable formats. We have consistently found in all      reviewed models that primitives for representation of actions and decisions are      necessary components of a guideline representation model. Patient states and      execution states are important concepts that closely relate to each other.      Scheduling constraints on representation primitives can be modeled as sequences,       concurrences, alternatives, and loops in a guideline's application process.      Nesting of guidelines provides multiple views to a guideline with different      granularities. Integration of guidelines with electronic medical records can be      facilitated by the introduction of a formal model for patient data. Data      collection, decision, patient state, and intervention constitute four basic types      of primitives in a guideline's logic flow. Decisions clarify our understanding on      a patient's clinical state, while interventions lead to the change from one      patient state to another.

PMID- 12467790   - Traditionally, diagnosis and treatment have been seen as two distinct tasks.      Consequently, most approaches to computer supported health care focus on one of      the two-mostly on diagnosis or rather on the interpretation of measurements which      is much better understood and formalised. However, in practice diagnosis and      treatment overlap and influence each other in many ways. Combinations range from       repeatedly going through the diagnosis-treatment loop over a period of time to      permanent monitoring of the patients' health condition as it is done in intensive      care units. In this article we describe how to model these combinations using the      clinical protocol-representation language ASBRU. It implements treatment steps in      a hierarchy of skeletal, time-oriented plans. Diagnosis can either be described      in a declarative way in the conditions, under which treatment steps are taken or       it can be modelled explicitly as plans of their own right. We demonstrate our     approach using examples taken from the American Association of Paediatricians'      guideline for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in the new-born.

PMID- 12467789   - Cognitive science is a rich source of insight for creative use of new Web      technologies by medical informatics workers. I outline a project to Web-enable an      existing computer-based patient record (CPR) in the context of ideas from      philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology. Web      prototypes play an important role (a) because Web technology lends itself to      rapid prototype development, and (b) because prototypes help team members bridge       among disparate medical, computing, and business ontologies. Six Web-enabled CPR       prototypes were created and ranked. User scenarios were generated using a user     communication matrix. Resulting prototypes were compared according to the degree       to which they satisfied medical, computing, and business constraints. In a      different organization, or at different time, candidate prototypes and their     ranking might have been different. However, prototype generation and comparison      are fundamentally influenced by factors usefully understood in a cognitive      science framework.

PMID- 12467788   - Disease specific systems usually offer excellent functionality for the management      of the covered diseases. But the restriction to a certain disease often hampers      their wide spread use since they are not optimised for clinical workflow. The      Giessener Tumordokumentationssystem (GTDS) is a disease specific system that is      not only designed for the use in tumour registries but also to support clinical      care. In order to integrate it into hospital information systems, we implemented       standard communication interfaces. However, interfaces are not satisfactory since      they do not consider aspects of the normal workflow of a clinical user.      Therefore, we developed a strategy that should ease the access to the system in      the environment of existing systems. From the technical point of view, XML with      its capabilities to represent even complex data in a rather simple way helped to       implement this strategy. We use XML to communicate with API-like services and      created a WWW environment to demonstrate the access to these services. Since HTML      based access itself is a means to integrate systems, we intend to expand this      environment to an appropriate region based means to improve the communication      with registries. Another application using the services is the transfer of data      between two registries with common patients.

PMID- 12467787   - A fundamental requirement for achieving continuity of care is the seamless      sharing of multimedia clinical information. Different technological approaches      can be adopted for enabling the communication and sharing of health record      segments. In the context of the emerging global information society, the creation      of and access to the integrated electronic health record (I-EHR) of a citizen has      been assigned high priority in many countries. This requirement is complementary       to an overall requirement for the creation of a health information infrastructure      (HII) to support the provision of a variety of health telematics and e-health      services. In developing a regional or national HII, the components or building      blocks that make up the overall information system ought to be defined and an      appropriate component architecture specified. This paper discusses current      international priorities and trends in developing the HII. It presents      technological challenges and alternative approaches towards the creation of an      I-EHR, being the aggregation of health data created during all interactions of an      individual with the healthcare system. It also presents results from an ongoing      Research and Development (R&D) effort towards the implementation of the HII in      HYGEIAnet, the regional health information network of Crete, Greece, using a      component-based software engineering approach. Critical design decisions and      related trade-offs, involved in the process of component specification and      development, are also discussed and the current state of development of an I-EHR       service is presented. Finally, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and security      issues, which are important for the deployment and use of any I-EHR service, are       considered.

PMID- 12460636   - In languages with diacritic marks, such as French, there remain instances of      textual or terminological resources that are available in electronic form without      diacritic marks, which hinders their use in natural language interfaces. In a      specialized domain such as medicine, it is often the case that some words are not      found in the available electronic lexicons. The issue of accenting unknown words       then arises: it is the theme of this work. We propose two internal methods for     accenting unknown words, which both learn on a reference set of accented words      the contexts of occurrence of the various accented forms of a given letter. One      method is adapted from part-of-speech tagging, the other is based on finite state      transducers. We show experimental results for letter e on the French version of      the Medical Subject Headings thesaurus. With the best training set, the tagging      method obtains a precision-recall breakeven point of 84.2+/-4.4% and the      transducer method 83.8+/-4.5% (with a baseline at 64%) for the unknown words that      contain this letter. A consensus combination of both increases precision to      92.0+/-3.7% with a recall of 75%. We perform an error analysis and discuss      further steps that might help improve over the current performance.

PMID- 12460635   - We present a framework for concept-based cross-language information retrieval in       the medical domain, which is under development in the MUCHMORE project. Our     approach is based on using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as the      primary source of semantic data. Documents and queries are annotated with      multiple layers of linguistic information. Linguistic processing includes      part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis, phrase recognition and the      identification of medical terms and semantic relations between them. The paper     describes experiments in monolingual and cross-language document retrieval,      performed on a corpus of medical abstracts. Results show that linguistic      processing, especially lemmatization and compound analysis for German, is a      crucial step in achieving a good baseline performance. On the other hand, they      show that semantic information, specifically the combined use of concepts and      relations, increases the performance in monolingual and cross-language retrieval.

PMID- 12460634   - OBJECTIVE: We investigate the use of adjectival modification as a way of      assessing the systematic use of linguistic phenomena to represent similar lexical      or semantic features in the constituent terms of a vocabulary. METHODS: Terms      consisting of one or more adjectival modifiers followed by a head noun are      selected from disease and procedure terms in SNOMED. Frequently co-occurring      adjectival modifiers are systematically combined with the contexts (i.e., terms      minus modifier) of each modifier. The existence of these combinations is checked       in both SNOMED and the entire UMLS Metathesaurus; the term corresponding to the      context alone is similarly checked. Relationships among terms sharing a context      and between each of these terms and their context are studied. RESULTS: Four     pairs of modifiers were studied: (acute, chronic), (unilateral, bilateral),      (primary, secondary), and (acquired, congenital). The numbers of contexts studied      for each pair ranged from 73 to 974. The percentage of contexts associated with      both modifiers ranged from 5 to 50% in SNOMED and from 10 to 60% in UMLS. The      presence of the context term varied from 31 to 64% in SNOMED and from 43 to 79%      in UMLS. Finally, 172 occurrences (9%) of synonymy between a modified term and      the context term were found in SNOMED. One hundred and forty-five such      occurrences (8%) were found in the entire Metathesaurus.

PMID- 12460633   - Unlike journal corpora, which are supposed to be carefully reviewed before being       published, the quality of documents in a patient record are often corrupted by      mispelled words and conventional graphies or abbreviations. After a survey of the      domain, the paper focuses on evaluating the effect of such corruption on an      information retrieval (IR) engine. The IR system uses a classical bag of words      approach, with stems as representation items and term frequency-inverse document       frequency (tf-idf) as weighting schema; we pay special attention to the      normalization factor. First results shows that even low corruption levels (3%) do      affect retrieval effectiveness (4-7%), whereas higher corruption levels can      affect retrieval effectiveness by 25%. Then, we show that the use of an improved       automatic spelling correction system, applied on the corrupted collection, can      almost restore the retrieval effectiveness of the engine.

PMID- 12460632   - MEDSYNDIKATE is a natural language processor, which automatically acquires      medical information from findings reports. In the course of text analysis their     contents is transferred to conceptual representation structures, which constitute      a corresponding text knowledge base. MEDSYNDIKATE is particularly adapted to deal      properly with text structures, such as various forms of anaphoric reference      relations spanning several sentences. The strong demands MEDSYNDIKATE poses on      the availability of expressive knowledge sources are accounted for by two      alternative approaches to acquire medical domain knowledge (semi)automatically.      We also present data for the information extraction performance of MEDSYNDIKATE      in terms of the semantic interpretation of three major syntactic patterns in      medical documents.

PMID- 12460631   - A prerequisite for all higher level information extraction tasks is the      identification of unknown names in text. Today, when large corpora can consist of      billions of words, it is of utmost importance to develop accurate techniques for       the automatic detection, extraction and categorization of named entities in these      corpora. Although named entity recognition might be regarded a solved problem in       some domains, it still poses a significant challenge in others. In this work we      focus on one of the more difficult tasks, the identification of protein names in       text. This task presents several interesting difficulties because of the named      entities variant structural characteristics, their sometimes unclear status as      names, the lack of common standards and fixed nomenclatures, and the specifics of      the texts in the molecular biology domain in which they appear. We describe how      we approached these and other difficulties in the implementation of Yapex, a      system for the automatic identification of protein names in text. We also      evaluate Yapex under four different notions of correctness and compare its      performance to that of another publicly available system for protein name      recognition.

PMID- 12460630   - In this paper we describe Tagged Information Management System (TIMS), an      integrated knowledge management system for the domain of molecular biology and      biomedicine, in which terminology-driven literature mining, knowledge acquisition      (KA), knowledge integration (KI), and XML-based knowledge retrieval are combined       using tag information management and ontology inference. The system integrates      automatic terminology acquisition, term variation management, hierarchical term      clustering, tag-based information extraction (IE), and ontology-based query      expansion. TIMS supports introducing and combining different types of tags      (linguistic and domain-specific, manual and automatic). Tag-based interval      operations and a query language are introduced in order to facilitate KA and      retrieval from XML documents. Through KA examples, we illustrate the way in which      literature mining techniques can be utilised for knowledge discovery from      documents.

PMID- 12460629   - Much of knowledge modeling in the molecular biology domain involves interactions       between proteins, genes, various forms of RNA, small molecules, etc. Interactions      between these substances are typically extracted and codified manually,      increasing the cost and time for modeling and substantially limiting the coverage      of the resulting knowledge base. In this paper, we describe an automatic system      that learns from text interaction verbs; these verbs can then form the core of      automatically retrieved patterns which model classes of biological interactions.       We investigate text features relating verbs with genes and proteins, and apply      statistical tests and a logistic regression statistical model to determine      whether a given verb belongs to the class of interaction verbs. Our system, AVAD,      achieves over 87% precision and 82% recall when tested on an 11 million word      corpus of journal articles. In addition, we compare the automatically obtained      results with a manually constructed database of interaction verbs and show that      the automatic approach can significantly enrich the manual list by detecting      rarer interaction verbs that were omitted from the database.

PMID- 12460628   - Literature mining is the process of extracting and combining facts from      scientific publications. In recent years, many computer programs have been      designed to extract various molecular biology findings from Medline abstracts or       full-text articles. The present article describes the range of text mining      techniques that have been applied to scientific documents. It divides 'automated       reading' into four general subtasks: text categorization, named entity tagging,      fact extraction, and collection-wide analysis. Literature mining offers powerful       methods to support knowledge discovery and the construction of topic maps and      ontologies. An overview is given of recent developments in medical language      processing. Special attention is given to the domain particularities of molecular     biology, and the emerging synergy between literature mining and molecular     databases accessible through Internet.

PMID- 12453565   - In this contribution some comments are given regarding an article of Haux et al.,      which is published in the same issue. After discussing some general aspects of      the paper, the comments focus on patient-centred care and genomics. Trends that      are observed today are used to predict the situation with respect of the use of      ICT in healthcare in the year 2013. It is postulated that a shared electronic      patient record in which both healthcare provider and patient enter and retrieve      data will be available. The role of the patient in the management of her disease       will be much larger than it is now. The impact of new knowledge coming from the      field of genomics will be large. It is not possible to predict the impact on      functionality and the use of healthcare information systems in 2013.

PMID- 12453564   - The paper, entitled 'Health care in the information society-a prognosis for the      year 2013' is in this commentary compared with previous relevant documents. In      the paper quantitative prognoses are presented for each of 30 theses. Some      developments such as the influence of genomic medicine on health care were not      covered by the theses. ICT measures as suggested in the paper are quite      acceptable but the paper does not mention side effects of ICT on health care and       is therefore a bit unbalanced. As a reference, the Japanese grand design for     information-oriented health care is also introduced.

PMID- 12453563   - This paper examines the paper of Haux et al. in this issue of this journal. It      gives some background on specifics of the German health care system, which      underlie the theses and prognoses proposed by Haux et al. In analogy to a      forecast of the future of health informatics, which is now 10 years old, I then      suggest that these attempts meet two types of challenges:that of overestimating      the positive effects of recent advances, which later are found not to scale up;      and that of blind spots with respect to unforeseen significant advances. The      attempt to find indications of such in the projections of Haux et al. leads,      among other, to the conclusion that the projections of direct linkages between      patients and care providers may be overoptimistic. As to whether the deviating      opinions matter in the end, it is concluded that the technology advances may      require less attention that the restructuring of the health care system required       to take advantage of the advances of technology.

PMID- 12453561   - Applying information and communication technology (ICT) to a given medical domain      is not merely adding a new technique. When applied to a medical domain, ICT has      the potential to radically change processes in that domain. In their paper     'Health care in the information society: a prognosis for the year 2013' Haux and       co-workers provide us with a set of predictions based on progress in three main      areas: (1). patient-centred recording and use of medical data for collaborative      care; (2). process-integrated decision support; and (3). comprehensive use of      patient data for research and health care reporting. We complement their theses      by predicting some of the feedback mechanisms that will develop as ICT is shaping      health care. Feedback is return to the input of a part of the output of a      mechanism; this part of the input constituting information that reports      discrepancies between intended and actual operation and leads to a      self-correcting action that can be utilised. We discuss feedback in the areas      Haux identifies: the patient record, decision support, and the use of data for     research and health care reporting. For each of these domains, we will discuss      the output that serves as input, the discrepancies discovered, and the      self-correction that will or should follow.

PMID- 12453560   - In a discussion starting from Haux et al. it is asked, if a safe and controllable      technology to implement the patient centered health record is available and which      measures must be taken to insure the safety of the record-these include      legislation, education, technical measures etc. In addition to the goals set      forward in the support for patient empowerment is proposed as another major goal       for IT-systems in medicine for the next decade. Finally the role of IT with      respect to physicians and patients is discussed: IT systems have the capability      to perform tasks that are considered the tasks of physicians and it is likely,      that these capabilities will be implemented.

PMID- 12453559   - A prognosis of how the information society in health care will look like in 2013       must start from the current state of affairs at the given locality regarding      healthcare management by public authorities including legislative, ICT      technological levels and accessibility of professional knowledge in individual      fields of medicine. It is presumed that after 10 years the influence of this      'starting point' will still persist and knowledge of the current state of affairs      will be needed to positively but also negatively differentiates the prognosis      [Health Care in the Information Society: A Prognosis for the Year 2013, in this      issue] for individual localities, e.g. Germany versus neighbouring the Czech      Republic. The present article focuses on aims of Czech health care and the      measures that are taken in Czech health care that are carried out and which have       been already initiated. Their significance towards the future prognosis according      to [Health Care in the Information Society: A Prognosis for the Year 2013, in      this issue] is clear. The first measure is legalisation of conditions, which      allow health care administration only be carried out with electronic forms and      the protection of these sensitive personal data when they are placed in a      centralised data depository where they are prepared for physicians who use them      while providing health care in health institutions. In the Czech Republic an      information system is developed called Internet Access to Health Patient      Information (IHPI). The second measure is creating a unified central system of      health information together with methodologies for data collection, data      standards and protocols. In the Czech Republic there is the National Health      Information System (NHIS) governed by the Institute for Health Information and      Statistics (IHIS CR). The NHIS enables care providers to get information about      the health state of citizens, about health institutions, about their activities      and economics, it enables to regulate the provision of health care, to define      conceptions of state health politics and to administrate public health. The third      measure is legalisation of possibilities to establish centralised health care      registers that are designated for recording and following of patients with chosen      socially serious diseases. These registers help with diagnosis and therapy and      reveal consequences of diseases for the patients. It helps to evaluate      accessibility and quality of provided health care in the country. An important      goal of the use of health care registers and information systems is for     educational purposes and as causal expert systems for physicians. The National      Health Registers have been introduced to the whole of the Czech Republic; some of      them are accessible on-line in a countrywide data network. The last part of the      paper focuses on research and education for developing the information society in      Czech health care and on co-operation with EU countries in selected projects and       initiatives.

PMID- 12453558   - This article comments on the article 'Health Care in the Information Society; A      Prognosis for the Year 2013' by Reinhold Haux et al. It is emphasised that      besides the driving forces as identified in that article, the changes in the      composition of the population will lead to a structural shortage of health      professionals. So, despite the willingness of both individual patients and the      society as a whole to pay more for health care no significant change will occur     in the percentage of the gross domestic product spent on health care. By      consequence we can not meet the challenges health care is facing by 'more of the       same'. New forms of health care delivery have to be invented and implemented that      lead to higher efficiency. The question is discussed whether health care is      lagging behind other sectors of society in the application of ICT, the answer to       that question is negative. It is explained why the percentage of the budget spent      on ICT is no valuable yardstick. Comments are made to the quantitative      expectations of Haux et al. Finally it is recommended that IMIA takes the      initiative to organise in co-operation with international associations of health       professionals a multidisciplinary working conference on the future role of ICT in      health care.

PMID- 12453557   - New knowledge from biotechnology and new capabilities provided by the evolving      global information infrastructure are already transforming health care. Three      clusters of technologies hold particular promise: grid computing, intimate      computing, and micro laboratory computing. The confluence of these technologies      will change clinical laboratory equipment into portable devices, easing the      administrative details involved in delivering care and ushering in a new age of      monitoring clinical states. Two vignettes, an office visit and a clinical trial,       are offered as prognosis for clinical care in 2013. New capabilities hold the      power to transform health care, making it truly patient centered as the Institute      of Medicine (IOM) has urged.

PMID- 12453556   - This paper aims at further expanding the vision of future health care delivery      systems presented by Haux et al. (2002). Starting from the observation that      information and communication technology (ICT) is deeply transforming the shape      of organizations as expected, we argue that the coordination of work activities      is a fundamental need for any organization. This is even more important for     health care organizations since there is an increasing pressure to increase      quality of care they deliver without further increasing its costs. However ICT by      itself will not cause the desired changes without rethining the way of managing      best practice biomedical knowledge and care delivery processes. Thus the paper     focuses on the need of developing intense research efforts in the fields of      knowledge management and workflow modelling, which have been identified as      fundamental to provide suitable solutions to the problems of designing and      building innovative health care information systems. Moreover, the paper     discusses the role of mobile communication systems. Moreover, the paper discusses      the role of mobile communication and speech understanding technologies to support      a satisfactory user-system interaction in daily work.

PMID- 12453555   - This commentary of Haux' prognosis of the state of affairs in health care and      information technology in the year 2013 argues the importance of standing up      against the many high-tech, utopian dreams that are often associated with ICT in       health care. Discussing many of the themes that Haux brings up, three issues are       particularly focused upon: the importance of 'patient-centered' care, the      changing position of the professional in current health care, and the nature of      health care information. In all these issues, cliches threaten to hide several      real and possibly painful issues, which, if unaddressed, will hamper any real      progress. In all these issues, moreover, medical informatics plays an important      role, and is a core actor in the future shaping of our health care systems. This       responsibility should not be taken lightly.

PMID- 12453554   - This brief article is a commentary on the Haux et al. paper on Health Care in the      Information Society: a prognosis for the year 2013. The commentary concentrates      in particular on the underlying assumptions, which are at the core of the Haux et      al. vision for healthcare in 2013. They assume that while there will be a shift      towards increased patient-centred, community-based shared care, the underlying      healthcare system will remain essentially the same. This commentary suggests that      this is a conservative view and indeed questions its validity. Radical financial       pressures to control costs as well as demands for equity fueled by more      knowledgeable and better informed patients have the potential to bring about      fundamental changes, with consequences for the way in which healthcare is      delivered and in turn in how information and communications technologies are      utilised.

PMID- 12453552   - Our society is increasingly influenced by modern information and communication      technology (ICT). Health care has profited greatly by this development. How could      health care provision look in the near future, in 10 years, or more precisely, in      the year 2013? What measures must be undertaken by political and self-governing      health institutions, and by medical informatics research, to ensure an efficient,      medically advanced and yet affordable future health care system? Three factors      will greatly influence the further development of information processing in      health care within the near future: the development of the population, medical      advances, and advances in informatics. These factors have motivated us to set up       30 theses for health care provision in the year 2013. The theses cover areas of      health care, such as its people, its information systems, and its ICT tools.      Three major goals requiring achievement have been identified: patient-centered      recording and use of medical data for cooperative care, process-integrated      decision support through current medical knowledge, comprehensive use of patient       data for research and health care reporting. In consequence, political      institutions should provide a framework for networked, patient-centered health      care. They are called on to regulate the storage and exchange of health care data      and of appropriate information system architectures. Finally, the health care      institutions themselves must emphasize professional information management more      strongly. Relevant research topics in medical informatics are: comprehensive      electronic patient records, modern health information system architectures,      architectures for medical knowledge centers, specific data processing methods      ('medical data mining'), and multi-functional, mobile ICT tools.

PMID- 12414020   - Generic clinical study data management systems can record data on an arbitrary      number of parameters in an arbitrary number of clinical studies without requiring      modification of the database schema. They achieve this by using an      Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model for clinical data. While very flexible for     creating transaction-oriented systems for data entry and browsing of individual      forms, EAV-modeled data is unsuitable for direct analytical processing, which is       the focus of data marts. For this purpose, such data must be extracted and      restructured appropriately. This paper describes how such a process, which is      non-trivial and highly error prone if performed using non-systematic approaches,       can be automated by judicious use of the study metadata-the descriptions of      measured parameters and their higher-level grouping. The metadata, in addition to      driving the process, is exported along with the data, in order to facilitate its       human interpretation.

PMID- 12414019   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a physician's order entry (POE) system on      physicians' ordering patterns and patient length of stay. DESIGN: Prospective      time series study at pre-POE, 3 months and 6 months after POE at a tertiary      teaching hospital in Korea. The study period was from June 1999 to May 2000.      MEASUREMENTS: The number of orders (doctor's, PRN, medication, changed, canceled       orders), number of tests (complete blood count, chemistry, chest X-ray, stat      laboratory, serum electrolytes tests), appropriateness and length of patient stay      were measured through chart review of 171 in-patients (liver disease, renal      disease, gastrectomy, simple mastectomy). RESULTS: The number of doctors' orders,      PRN, and medication orders significantly increased after POE. The numbers of      changed and canceled orders were not significantly different between pre- and      post-POE. The number of stat lab tests significantly decreased after POE. There      was no change in appropriateness of patients' hospital stay between pre- and      post-POE. Length of stay significantly decreased (P=0.049). CONCLUSION: POE      contributed to improving the quality of care in two ways: improvement of      auditability by recording the medical services for patients in more precise and      transparent manner, and more appropriate utilization of resources by decreasing      the number of stat diagnostic tests and length of stay.

PMID- 12414018   - The purpose of this study is to investigate and characterize the errors in      cognitive processes deployed in the comprehension of procedural texts found on      pharmaceutical labels by subjects of different cultural and educational      backgrounds. In this study, participants were asked to read and interpret three      pharmaceutical labels related to children's medications of varying complexity:      oral rehydration therapy (ORT); over-the-counter cough medicine; and      over-the-counter fever medicine. Results indicate that: (1) all groups of      participants had considerable difficulty in interpreting the instructions; (2),      cultural and educational background appeared to be only weakly related to the      accuracy of dosage and administration; and (3) errors of comprehension were      related to three features of the texts: situation-representational complexity,      inherent quantification complexity, and conformity with intuitive models of      therapy based on prior knowledge. The results are discussed in terms of the role       of multiple representations (boundary objects) and theories of text comprehension      to facilitate the reduction of errors.

PMID- 12414017   - OBJECTIVES: The proper alignment of functional features of the ICT-infrastructure      to business processes is a major challenge in health care organisations. This      alignment takes into account that the organisational structure not only shapes      the ICT-infrastructure, but that the inverse also holds. To solve the alignment      problem, relevant features of the ICT-infrastructure should be derived from the      organisational structure and the influence of this envisaged ICT to the work      practices should be pointed out. The objective of our study was to develop a      method to solve this alignment problem. METHODS: In a previous study we      demonstrated the appropriateness of the business process modelling methodology      Dynamic Essential Modelling of Organizations (DEMO). A proven and widely used      modelling language for expressing functional features is Unified Modelling      Language (UML). In the context of a specific case study at the University Medical      Centre Utrecht in the Netherlands we investigated if the combined use of DEMO and      UML could solve the alignment problem. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study      demonstrated that the DEMO models were suited as a starting point in deriving      system functionality by using the use case concept of UML. Further, the case      study demonstrated that in using this approach for the alignment problem, insight      is gained into the mutual influence of ICT-infrastructure and organisation      structure: (a) specification of independent, re-usable components-as a set of      related functionalities-is realised, and (b) a helpful representation of the      current and future work practice is provided for in relation to the envisaged ICT      support.

PMID- 12052427   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate a fully automated and modified APACHE II score      calculation exclusively based on routine data supplied by patient data management      system, the ICUData, and to assess the predictive performance of this score using      analysis of discrimination and calibration at an operative ICU. METHOD: SQL      scripts (calculation programs) were developed to calculate the scores of 524      patients who stayed at the ICU between April 1st, 1999 and March 31st, 2000. The       calculation programs considered unavailable data as 'not pathological'. The main       outcome measure was survival status at ICU discharge. The discriminative power on      mortality of this modified APACHE II score was checked with a receiver operating       characteristic (ROC) curve. Calibration was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow      goodness-of-fit test. RESULTS: The 459 survivors had an average APACHE score of      17.8+/-5.3. The score of the 65 deceased patients averaged 22.7+/-4.6. The area      under the ROC curve of 0.790 was significantly >0.5 (P<0.01) and had a 95%      confidence interval (CI) of 0.712-0.825. The goodness-of-fit test showed a good      calibration (H=4.89, P=0.70, dof 7, C=6.96, P=0.541, dof 8). CONCLUSION: A      prediction model based on completely automatically calculated 'modified APACHE II      scores' can be constructed using data collected with PDMS. However, due to      differences in the patient collective and methods used, the results need      validation and can only be partially compared to results from other studies.

PMID- 12052426   - OBJECTIVE: To investigate necessary conditions for the establishment of a      database of diseases and health problems for research and health care planning,      based on electronic patient records in everyday clinical use among general      practitioners (GPs). DESIGN: Postal questionnaire study. SETTING: Primary health       care in Sweden. SUBJECTS: Three hundred randomly selected GPs. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURES: Degree of computerisation of patient records. User frequency and      characteristics of diagnosis classification systems and coding tools. Frequency      of coding activities and retrieval of codes, and related attitudes. Opinions on a      primary health care version of ICD-10. RESULTS: A total of 184 GPs (61% of the      300 GPs) were included in the study. About 92% used an electronic record system,       some type of diagnostic classification was used by 93%, and ICD based      classifications by 88%. The classification in use was computerised for 74%.      Mainly simple tools were used to retrieve diagnostic codes. About 76% of GPs      reported classifying at least one symptom or disease per encounter. The codes      were retrieved 'once a month' or more by 19%. Classification of diseases was      considered important for follow-up by 83%, and for the care of the patient by 75%      of the GPs. The primary health care version of ICD-10 with a total of 972 codes      was considered too limited in size by 31%. CONCLUSION: Electronic patient records      in everyday clinical use in Swedish general practice provide several fundamentals      for a database of diagnostic data. However, there are several barriers to the      establishment of such a database that is both valid and reliable.

PMID- 12052425   - The purpose of this research was to identify, name and define a set of concepts      to describe specific times and time intervals relevant to patient transport by      helicopter. A list of 206 potential terms was identified from 96 patient records.      A purposive sample of experts representing nurses, physicians, paramedics, pilots      and communication specialists involved in air transport was selected to      participate in a five-round Delphi study conducted by email. A set of 19 concepts      were identified and defined. Fifteen of the terms were specific times, such as      Time of Call, Depart Base and Arrive Location. Four of the terms were intervals,       such as Ground Time or Transport Time.

PMID- 12052424   - PROMISE AND REALITY: this review addresses two questions. First, why is the      introduction of the computerized patient record (CPR) so slow, while its      potential for improved quality of care and reduction of cost is well recognized?       Second, what, in this respect, is the role of record architecture and      standardization? BARRIERS: the impediments for CPR adoption are put in a larger     context by addressing the relationship among effort, benefit, and the parties      involved. An important financial impediment is insufficient return of investment.      Other hurdles related to the use of CPRs are lack of integration and flexibility,      which cause clinicians to experience insufficient reward to motivate them for     data entry and changes in working style. Effort and benefit have to be balanced      for each party involved. REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT: lack of standardization      impedes exchange and sharing of medical data, and new developments cause fear of       applications to become outdated. Flexibility in content and use, integration, and      adaptability to change, are key requirements for CPR systems. These requirements       can most effectively be met through an architecture that separates content and      structure, such that the road to standardization is not paved with frequent      expensive adaptations. STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION: successful implementation      and acceptance require reliable evaluation of applications by independent      professional groups. Users need to be involved in setting priorities and planning      for actual implementation.

PMID- 12052423   - In this paper we present a complete reference framework for the provision of      quality assured Trusted Third Party (TTP) services within a medical environment.       The main objective is to provide all the basic guidelines towards the development      of a quality system for a TTP as an organisation, which could be mapped directly       to the requirements of ISO-9000 standards. The important results of the      implementation of a quality system, are the enhanced trustworthiness of the TTP      and the confidence of the medical society in the provided services. Furthermore,       the value added certification services conform to customer requirements and are      characterised by efficiency, reliability, security, credibility and trust. The      internal organisation acquires a clear and strict structure and maximises its      effectiveness by establishing quality management, committed to control, assure      and improve quality. The TTP requirements for quality are identified and the      various elements of the quality system are described illustratively.

PMID- 11904249   - Healthcare systems are complex sociotechnical systems in which many information      system innovations fail because of problems in planning or design. One of the      reasons for this is that traditional analysis methods were designed for stable,      relatively simple systems and single users. New analytical approaches are needed       that can encompass the complexity of changing systems and multiple, interacting      users. The author suggests that integrating two seemingly disparate approaches      may be helpful in achieving successful designs for the complexities of healthcare      systems. The first is derived from Carper's four ways of knowing; the second is      Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA). The utility of the approach is demonstrated via a       case study.

PMID- 11904248   - A wealth of information addressing health status, outcomes and resource      utilization is compiled and made available by various government agencies. While       exploration of the data is possible using existing tools, in general, would-be      users of the resources must acquire CD-ROMs or download data from the web, and      upload the data into their own database. Where web interfaces exist, they are      highly structured, limiting the kinds of queries that can be executed. This work       develops a web-based database interface engine whose content and structure is      generated through interaction with a metadata table. The result is a dynamically       generated web interface that can easily accommodate changes in the underlying      data model by altering the metadata table, rather than requiring changes to the      interface code. This paper discusses the background and implementation of the      metadata table and web-based front end and provides examples of its use with the       NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER) database.

PMID- 11904247   - OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevailing attitudes among physicians to use of      computers in the clinical setting and specifically those attitudes that may be      associated with the adoption of computers in practice. DESIGN: A self-completed,       20-question postal questionnaire sent to 4850 randomly selected physicians. The      questionnaire focused on details of the physicians' practice; actual      computerization of or intention to computerize clinical and administrative      functions; attitudes towards computerization; self-perceived computer ability and      knowledge; and demographic information. The attitude statements were grouped      under four themes according to a factor analysis. RESULTS: The survey was      completed by 897 physicians. Only physicians in 'individual' practices were      included in the analysis. This group was further dichotomized into clinical users      (those with one or more clinical functions computerized) and non-clinical users.       Non-clinical users were older and had fewer specialist qualifications. Although      there was strong support for the attitude statements among both groups with      regard to the benefit of computerization to patient care, there was much less      support for electronic medical records. Non-clinical users were concerned about      the potentially negative impact of computerization on the clinical encounter and       the perceived high cost of computerization. DISCUSSION: The attitudes among      current clinical users and non-users were substantially different. The most      important disincentives to computerization were the potential for interference      with the patient-physician encounter and the cost of computerizing multiple      practice locations. Turning these disincentives into opportunities for change      remains the challenge.

PMID- 11904246   - In the year 2000 the University of Heidelberg and the University of Applied      Sciences Heilbronn established a second educational program in medical      informatics, leading to a Master of Science (MSc) degree. In addition to their     4.5 year medical informatics program as an informatics-based approach to medical       informatics, a postgraduate program in 'health information management'      (Informationsmanagement in der Medizin) was set up as a complementary health care      oriented approach to this field. The aim of the MSc program is to qualify      physicians and other health care professionals to work as medical informaticians,      particularly in the area of health information management. We admit 15 new      students into the program each year. The intended program length is 15 months,      comprising two study semesters (14 weeks per semester) and three months for the      Master's thesis. The graduates are awarded the title 'Master of Science' by the      Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg. The program is part of the      International Partnership in Health Informatics Education of the Universities of       Amsterdam, Heidelberg/Heilbronn, Minnesota and Utah. We report on this new      program and on our experience with our very first students. The curriculum is      compared with the related MSc programs.

PMID- 11904245   - OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of information retrieval from narrative      patient records utilizing manually supplied semantic tags. DESIGN: Retrospective       evaluation of narrative electronic record notes with respect to consistency of      manually supplied semantic tags. Assessment of retrieval effectiveness using      string matching methods and methods based on structural characteristics of data.       SETTING: Department of Neurology in a Norwegian university hospital using a      document based electronic patient record system offering template assisted manual      semantic indexing of textual record notes. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of      consistently tagged information. Retrieval effectiveness expressed as recall      (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value). RESULTS: Seventy-five      percent of the content was consistently tagged. Retrieval models based on simple       string matching performed better than models based on semantic tags alone with      respect to best mean recall and mean precision at high recall-levels. Models      combining both simple string matching and semantic tagging performed better than       separate models with respect to best mean recall (0.95) and mean precision at      high levels of recall. CONCLUSION: Although template assisted semantic indexing      of narrative electronic patient record notes showed suboptimal consistency, it      significantly improved retrieval effectiveness with respect to best mean recall      obtained by individual strategies and with respect to precision at any recall      level.

PMID- 11904244   - INTRODUCTION: An electronic patient record (EPR) with disease-specific data may      support improvement of the quality of care for patients with chronic diseases.      The structure and content of such a record can only be assessed by clinicians in       co-operation with IT-specialists, because, the result has to be clinically      relevant, easily accessible and adjusted to the information needs of different      workers in primary care. METHODS: We applied a modified Delphi-procedure--a      method characterized by anonymous written comments by an expert panel. The panel       had to agree about the question whether or not an item should be included in the       EPR. The questions for the written comments were prepared by a steering committee      (general practitioners (GP) and health scientists, either expert in asthma and      disease management or IT-specialist) based on the guidelines for diagnosing and      treating asthma of the Dutch College of General Practitioners (DCGP). When      agreement within the panel was < or = 70%, we sent a modified format to the      expert panel for reassessment. RESULTS: Three written commentary rounds were      necessary, in which 95 potential items were discussed with the expert panel. In      the first round they selected 50 items relating to diagnosing asthma and 22      concerning the treatment of asthma. During the second round 17 items were still      under discussion and six were rejected. In subsequent rounds, the expert-panel      assessed the best registration format (operationalisation). The written rounds      failed to create a full consensus. Therefore the study ended with a consensus      meeting of the expert panel. Due to the presence and contribution of nearly all      experts, consensus could be reached about the structure and contents of the EPR     on asthma. DISCUSSION: The modified Delphi procedure, proved to be a feasible      method for selecting the optimal content of an electronic registration protocol.       Both, written and verbal commentary rounds were necessary. The existence of a set      of guidelines was essential.

PMID- 11904243   - Internet-based, personal health records have the potential to profoundly      influence the delivery of health care in the 21st Century, by changing the loci      and ownership of the record from one that is distributed among the various health      care providers a patient has seen in his lifetime, to one with a single source      that is accessible from anywhere in the world and under the shared ownership and       control of the patient and his provider(s). Internet-based personal health      records (PHRs) include any internet-accessible application that enables a patient      (or his guardian, the 'mom') to review, annotate, create or maintain a record of       any aspect(s) of his health condition, medication, medical problems, allergies,      vaccination history, visit history or communications with his healthcare      providers. The current state-of-the-art for personal health records is best      characterized as 'beta releases'. As the field matures and gains more experience,      these applications will improve significantly in ease of use and functionality.

PMID- 11734407   - The investigation results for improving lossy compression techniques for     ultrasound and angio images are presented. The goal was to determine where the      compression process could be improved for the medical application, and to make      efforts to improve it. It is proved that the wavelet transform outperforms the      discrete cosine transform applied to ultrasound and angio images. A lot of      wavelet classes were tried for choosing the best one suited for corresponding      image classes, which were characterised by a content complexity criterion. The      analysis of international image compression standards was carried out. Special      attention was paid to an algorithmical and high level service structure of a new       still image compression standard JPEG2000. Its open architecture enables      including some wavelet classes which we would like to suggest for medical images.      A set of recommendations for acceptable compression ratio for different medical      image modalities was developed. It was carried out on the base of compression      study performed by the group of angiologists and cardiologists.

PMID- 11734406   - In this article the software system ROBO-SIM is described. ROBO-SIM is a planning      and simulation tool for minimally invasive neurosurgery. Different to the most      other simulation tools, ROBO-SIM is able to use actual patient's datasets for     simulation. Same as in real neurosurgery a planning step, which provides more      functionality as up-to-date planning systems on the market, is performed before      undergoing the simulated operation. The planning steps include the definition of       the trepanation point for entry into the skull and the target point within the      depth of the brain, checking the surgical track and doing virtual trepanations      (virtual craniotomy). For use with an intra-operative active manipulator, which      is guided by the surgeon during real surgery (robotic surgery), go- and      non-go-areas can be defined. During operation, the robot restricts the surgeon      from leaving these go-areas. After planning, an additional simulation system,      which is understood as an extension to the planning step, is used to simulate      whole surgical interventions directly on the patient's anatomy basing on the      planning data and by using the same instruments as for the real intervention.      First tests with ROBO-SIM are performed on a phantom developed for this purpose      and on actual patient's datasets with ventricular tumours.

PMID- 11734404   - Two 3-D digitised atlases of a female and a male pelvis were generated to support      the virtual 3-D planning of hip operations. The anatomical atlases were designed       to replace the interactive, time-consuming pre-processing steps for the virtual      operation planning. Each atlas consists of a labelled reference CT data set and a      set of anatomical point landmarks. The paper presents methods for the automatic      transfer of these anatomical labels to an individual patient data set. The      labelled patient data are used to generate 3-D models of the patient's bone      structures. Besides the anatomical labelling, the determination of measures, like      angles, distances or sizes of contact areas, is important for the planning of hip      operations. Thus, algorithms for the automatic computation of orthopaedic      parameters were implemented. A first evaluation of the presented atlas-based      segmentation method shows a correct labelling of 98.5% of the bony voxels.

PMID- 11734403   - The transfer of large amounts of medical data within heterogeneous hard and      software infrastructures and the exploitation of distributed resources require a       fast, secure, and platform-independent data exchange. To avoid costly      vendor-specific solutions, a DICOM server was implemented in JAVA. Data access      was enabled via internet browser technology. Relevant patient and image      acquisition information was extracted from the DICOM images and stored into a      relational database. Patient information such as radiological findings were      transferred from the Radiological Information System into the database. Image      data were accessed either by a fast preview tool or using a JAVA-based DICOM      viewer. Since data security mechanisms are not yet part of the DICOM standard, a       DICOM-conform encryption of sensitive patient data was implemented. The method      allowed a dynamic selection of the data to be encrypted. Integrating this module       into the image server enabled the fast and secure transfer of image data across      insecure networks as well as long-term storage on CD-Recordables.

PMID- 11734402   - In this paper, a secure medical digital library is presented. It is based on the       CORBA specifications for distributed systems. The described approach relies on a       three-tier architecture. Interaction between the medical digital library and its       users is achieved through a Web server. The choice of employing Web technology      for the dissemination of medical data has many advantages compared to older     approaches, but also poses extra requirements that need to be fulfilled. Thus,      special attention is paid to the distinguished nature of such medical data, whose      integrity and confidentiality should be preserved at all costs. This is achieved       through the employment of Trusted Third Parties (TTP) technology for the support       of the required security services. Additionally, the proposed digital library      employs smartcards for the management of the various security tokens that are      used from the above services.

PMID- 11734401   - Health information systems supporting shared care are going to be distributed and      interoperable. Dealing with sensitive personal medical information, such      information systems have to provide appropriate security services, allowing only       authorised users restricted access rights to the patients' data according to the       'need to know' principle. Especially in healthcare, chip card based information      systems occur in the shape of patient data cards providing informational self      determination and mobility of the users as well as quality, integrity,      accountability, and availability of the data stored on the card, thus improving      the shared care of patients. The DIABCARD project aims at the implementation and       evaluation of a chip card based medical information system (CCMIS) for     facilitating communication and co-operation between health professionals in      different organisations or departments caring the same patient with diabetes as      an example. In co-operation with the EC-funded TrustHealth(2) project,      communication and application security services needed are provided like strong      authentication as well as the derived services such as authorisation, access      control, accountability, confidentiality, etc. The solution is based on Health      Professional Cards and Trusted Third Party services. In addition to the secure      handling of the patient's chip card and data in DIABCARD workstations, the secure      communication between these workstations and related departmental systems has      been implemented. Based on the results of this feasibility study, an enhanced      security services specification for the DIABCARD example of a CCMIS is provided      which will be implemented in the framework of a health network being established       in the German federal state Bavaria. Beside the preferred solution of a      combination of Patient Identification Card and Patient Data Card, lower level      alternatives using card-verifiable certificates are explained in some details.      Finally, a few legal issues, future trends like the XML standard set and their     implications for the solution presented as well as for distributed health      information systems in general are shortly discussed.

PMID- 11734400   - In this paper, the implementation of an Internet-based telematic service for     medical support is presented, which was developed and operated in pilot form      within the INTRANET HEALTH CLINIC project--a 2-year project supported by the      European Commission under the Health Telematics Programme. The aim of the      application is to offer high quality care to users of health services over     inexpensive communication pathways, using Internet-based, interactive      communication tools, like remote access to medical records and transmission of      multimedia information. The XML technology was employed to achieve customised      views on patient data, according to the access rights of different user profiles.      Strict security and access control policy were implemented to ensure secure      transmission of medical data through the Internet. The system was designed to      collaborate with existing clinical patient record systems and to be adjustable to      different medical applications. Current implementations include the fields of      Oncology, Lupus Erythrematosis, Obstetrics and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary      disease. The results of the pilot operation with oncological patients in Greece      were encouraging, so that the refining of the system and its expansion to a large      number of patients is already in progress.

PMID- 11734399   - This paper describes the use of extensible markup language (XML) for electronic      clinical communications in Scotland. It gives the results of the first UK project      to send and receive discharge letters using XML. This pilot had the advantage of       transferring readable clinical information between computer systems and giving      the receiving GP choice of decoding and saving clinical and administrative data      into his practice system. A number of existing clinical systems and a variety of       written documents were studied. Existing trial standards, including the NHS      EDIFACT, HL7v2 and CEN standard ENV 13606 were taken into consideration. The      project worked with the receiving GP system supplier, GPASS, and the NHS Scotland      Information and Statistics Division in defining the document type definition      (DTD) for the pilot DTD. GPASS undertook production of a module for their system       to parse the XML messages into the patient record on the GP system. The system      allows the GP to read and print the original document and modify the content      prior to storing in the practice system. SMTP e-mail messages were used for the      pilot. Resulting messages were parsed into the GP system and validated by a      variety of GP users. Currently there is a large scale program to develop XML      Schema and web browser based communications of referrals, discharge and      laboratory orders and reports.

PMID- 11734398   - PROBLEM: Clinicians' acceptance of clinical decision support depends on its      workflow-oriented, context-sensitive accessibility and availability at the point       of care, integrated into the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). Commercially      available Hospital Information Systems (HIS) often focus on administrative tasks       and mostly do not provide additional knowledge based functionality. Their     traditionally monolithic and closed software architecture encumbers integration      of and interaction with external software modules. Our aim was to develop methods      and interfaces to integrate knowledge sources into two different commercial      hospital information systems to provide the best decision support possible within      the context of available patient data. METHODS: An existing, proven standalone      scoring system for acute abdominal pain was supplemented by a communication      interface. In both HIS we defined data entry forms and developed individual and      reusable mechanisms for data exchange with external software modules. We designed      an additional knowledge support frontend which controls data exchange between HIS      and the knowledge modules. Finally, we added guidelines and algorithms to the      knowledge library. RESULTS: Despite some major drawbacks which resulted mainly      from the HIS' closed software architectures we showed exemplary, how external      knowledge support can be integrated almost seamlessly into different commercial      HIS. This paper describes the prototypical design and current implementation and       discusses our experiences.

PMID- 11734397   - In this paper we present the results of the MIE/GMDS-2000 Workshop 'Case-Based      Reasoning for Medical Knowledge-based Systems'. While in many domains Cased-Based      Reasoning (CBR) has become a successful technique for knowledge-based systems, in      the medical field attempts to apply the complete CBR cycle are rather     exceptional. Some systems have recently been developed, which on the one hand use      only parts of the CBR method, mainly the retrieval, and on the other hand enrich       the method by a generalisation step to fill the knowledge gap between the      specificity of single cases and general rules. And some systems rely on      integrating CBR and other problem solving methodologies. In this paper we discuss      the appropriateness of CBR for medical knowledge-based systems, point out      problems, limitations and possible ways to cope with them.

PMID- 11734396   - We describe the validation of a real-time automated reminder system that assists       General Practitioners (GP) in appropriate test ordering. We compared the comments      of human experts with the comments of the reminder system using a retrospective      random selection of 253 request forms. A panel of three expert physicians judged       the requested tests independently based on their interpretations of the practice       guidelines. The majority assessment of the physicians was compared with the      assessment of the reminder system. In case the system's output differed from the       majority assessment the written practice guidelines were consulted. On average      1.75 reminders were produced per form. In total 32 of the 442 given reminders      (7%) were given incorrectly. The amount of information and the level of detail      (the specificity of the terms) in which the GP describes the patients' medical      status are crucial for the reminder system to react correctly.

PMID- 11734395   - This paper presents a decision support system for nosocomial infections and its      integration in the large HIS of the University Hospital of Giessen. The system      comprises five different engines and a data dictionary. It is designed to detect       hospital acquired infections even in a situation where only a restricted amount      of clinical data is available (the data is split up in different information      systems). Furthermore the model prevents time consuming manual data entry. The      five engines split the main task into: (1) a preselection, which sorts out      patients who definitely do not have a nosocomial infection; (2) a rule based      reasoning process which detects patients likely to have such an infection; (3) an      alarm process which is responsible for the presentation of the alert; (4) an      explanation process to follow up the reasoning; and (5) statistic tools to answer     specific hygienic questions. A data dictionary supplies the controlled      vocabulary, which is required to understand data structures used in the different      clinical subsystems and may those with each other.

PMID- 11734394   - Intensive diabetes treatment can lead to a substantial reduction of the rate of      the complications associated with diabetes. However, a number of patients may      have poor control despite specialist care, and this along with devolution of care      to non-specialists suggests that alternative interventions should be developed.      The present paper describes an Internet based system where more emphasis is put      on patient empowerment, the keywords being education and communication. The      DiasNet system is based on a well documented decision support system, Dias,      designed for use by clinicians. The scope of DiasNet has been widened from being       used by clinicians to give advice on insulin dose, to also being used by patients      as a tool for education and communication. Patients can experiment with their own      data, adjusting insulin doses or meal sizes. In this way different therapeutic      and dietary alternatives can be tried out, allowing the patient to gain      experience in achieving glycaemic control. DiasNet is implemented in JAVA      according to the client/server principle, enabling a new way of communication      between patient and clinician: in case of any problems, the patient simply phones      the clinician, who immediately, using his or her office PC, can take a look at      the data the patient has entered.

PMID- 11734393   - This paper describes and discusses a framework that facilitates the development      of clinical guideline application tasks. The framework, named GASTON covers all      stages in the guideline development process, ranging from the definition of      models that represent guidelines to the implementation of run-time systems that      provide decision support, based on the guidelines that were developed during the       earlier stages. The GASTON framework consists of (1) a newly developed guideline       representation formalism that uses the concepts of primitives, problem-solving      methods (PSMs) and ontologies to represent the guidelines of various complexity      and granularity and different application domains, (2) a guideline authoring      environment that enables guideline authors to define the guidelines, based on the      newly developed guideline representation formalism and (3) a guideline execution       environment that translates defined guidelines into a more efficient symbol level      representation, which can be read in and processed by an execution time engine.      The paper describes a number of design criteria that were formulated regarding      the aspects of guideline representation, guideline authoring and guideline      execution and explains the framework by example in terms of the four stages that       were identified in the guideline development process and the tools that were      developed to support each stage. It also shows examples of systems that were      developed by means of the GASTON framework.

PMID- 11734392   - This paper reports an experience of computerising a clinical guideline for the      management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The guideline,      designed by the European NIDDM Policy Group is being used in a National Programme      for Diabetes supported by the Portuguese Ministry of Health, who is keen to      supporting its widespread use by general practitioners, namely in computerised      form. The paper presents the main characteristics of the prototype that was      implemented within the European project Prestige, and was developed according to       the Prestige Protocol Model. The model is briefly described, together with the      generic architecture that supports it. Then the main design decisions of the      prototype are explained, regarding the modelling of a general practitioner     workflow during a typical consultation and the user interface, two key issues for     obtaining acceptance from the users. The limitations of the system are discussed       and a number of directions are outlined in order to circumvent such limitations,       and broaden the scope of applicability of the system.

PMID- 11734391   - Even though computerized practice guidelines and workflow management (WfM) are      proven effective techniques to improving quality of care and reducing costs, they      are not widely deployed today. One reason for this is the impedance mismatch      between guideline systems and electronic health record (EHR) systems. This paper       presents the Unified Service Action Model (USAM) that has been developed for the       HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) and that conceptually integrates guidelines      and WfM in the EHR. We argue that the information items recorded in the EHR are      logically similar to elements of guideline and WfM definitions. Therefore, the      USAM suggests that guidelines and EHR reuse the same information structures. This      reuse is possible through a technique borrowed from natural language grammar and       modal logic. The conceptual alignment of guidelines, WfM and the EHR could      facilitate the sharing and deployment of guidelines in routine health care.

PMID- 11734389   - GIN Austria (Gesundheitsinformationsnetz Austria) offers patients and consumers      reliable medical knowledge about diseases, wellness and disease management in an       easy understandable way and enables them to quick and incessant access to      informations about the Austrian health system and Austrian health organizations.       To achieve full customer (patients, citizens) satisfaction to find relevant      information we propose a concept of a vector-model oriented IR-Tool based on the       controlled vocabulary of the MeSH Thesaurus (german version). By this approach      users who are often not used to scientific terms and expressions are supported to      build up their own query with MeSH Main Headings. In a second step broader and      narrower Main Headings are added to the query vector by the system. For this      calculation an adapted version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for directed,      azyclic graphs is used. The tool is part of the GIN Search Modul, which will ease      gathering health information from different heterogenous internet datasources.

PMID- 11734388   - The interconnection of heterogeneous computer applications in medicine raises the      issue of semantic interoperability, going beyond traditional approaches of      terminological standardization in basically three aspects. First, the variety of       medical vocabularies that currently coexist in different domains is a major     barrier for the integration of autonomously developed applications. Fortunately,       with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) there are machine-readable      terminological sources that cover and integrate most of the existing medical      vocabularies. Second, the exchanged data need to be processed by a machine for     different purposes like patient data integration, access to literature and      knowledge bases as well as clinical audit and research. Medical vocabularies      provided as passive dictionaries are no longer sufficient. Software system      developers should take advantage of terminological services for refining user     queries, for mapping the user's terms to appropriate medical vocabularies etc.      Third, the services should be accessible uniformly and transparently. In the      CORBAmed initiative a proposal for a standardized interface for querying and      accessing computerized medical terminology resources was created. Based on the      mentioned principles the MUSTANG system (Medical UMLS based Terminology Server     for Authoring, Navigating and Guiding the Retrieval to Heterogeneous Knowledge      Sources) has been developed. It is implemented on a Windows NT platform using the      ORACLE database management and development software. The terminological services       are accessible via multiple interfaces. The MUSTANG-System and the experiences      with using terminological services in practice are described. Opposed to other     levels of standardization like syntactical message standards there is much more a      hesitation in the use of standardized terminology.

PMID- 11734387   - We describe a semi-automatic knowledge engineering approach for converting the      human anatomy and pathology portion of the UMLS metathesaurus into a      terminological knowledge base. Particular attention is paid to the proper     representation of part-whole hierarchies, which complement taxonomic ones as a      major hierarchy-forming principle for anatomical knowledge. Our approach consists      of four steps. First, concept definitions are automatically generated from the      metathesaurus, with LOOM as the target language. Second, integrity checking of      the emerging taxonomic and partonomic hierarchies is automatically carried out by      the terminological classifier. Third, terminological cycles and inconsistencies      are manually eliminated and, in the last step, the knowledge base built this way       is incrementally refined by a medical expert. Our experiments were run on a      terminological knowledge base which is composed of 164,000 concepts and 76,000      relations. Empirical evidence for the lack of logical consistency, adequacy and      improper granularity of the UMLS knowledge source is given, and finally,      assessments of what kind of efforts are needed to render the formal target      representation structures complete and empirically adequate.

PMID- 11734386   - The approach of today's EPR seems so narrowly focused on automation of the      existing paper-based records by means of information technology that it becomes      obvious to raise the question: 'Will these automation efforts become an      impediment to innovation in products and services in health care?'. This paper     discusses how objectives like improvements and innovations in products and      services in health care are met by means of information technology (IT), and it      argues that a shift of focus from technological innovation to innovation in      products and services is necessary in order to obtain maximum benefit from IT.

PMID- 11734385   - Documentation of the nursing process is an important, but often neglected part of      clinical documentation. Paper-based systems have been introduced to support      nursing process documentation. Frequently, however, problems, such as low quality      and high writing efforts, are reported. However, it is still unclear if      computer-based documentation systems can reduce these problems. At the Heidelberg      University Medical Center, computer-based nursing process documentation projects       began in 1998. A computer-based nursing documentation system has now been      successfully introduced on four wards of three different departments, supporting       all six phases of the nursing process. The introduction of the new documentation       system was accompanied by systematic evaluations of prerequisites and      consequences. In this paper, we present preliminary results of this evaluation,      focusing on prerequisites of computer-based nursing process documentation. We      will discuss in detail the creation and use of predefined nursing care plans as      one important prerequisite for computer-based nursing documentation. We will also      focus on acceptance issues and on organizational and technical issues.

Before starting the development of the EPR, the attitude of users towards      electronic record keeping, their satisfaction with the paper clinical records,      their knowledge of computers, and their needs and expectations of computer     applications in health care were measured by means of a questionnaire. The      results of the questionnaire were supplemented with in-depth interviews. Users      had a neutral attitude towards electronic record keeping. They were more positive      about data entry of the paper records than data retrieval. During the development      phase, but prior to the implementation of the EPR, a second questionnaire      measured satisfaction with the paper records. Satisfaction appeared to be related      to self-rated computer experience. Inexperienced computer users tended to be more      positive about the paper records. In general, respondents did not have many      expectations about electronic record keeping. A second series of interviews      zoomed in on the expectations users had. Except for more concise reporting no      beneficial effects of electronic record keeping were expected.

PMID- 11734383   - As computers become more and more an aid in the management of medical      information, some specialists, such as anesthesiologists, demand tuned      applications to support their own activity. The development of these specific      applications is based upon the user's requirements analysis, and functional and      technical specifications. But some failures show that a better understanding of      human factors of acceptance could improve the usability and utility of these      tools. In this study, we demonstrated that when the management of medical      information is closely intertwined with the physician's activity, it is necessary      to perform a precise analysis of this activity in order to identify the cognitive      and organizational constraints that affect the usability and acceptance of the      tool. We focused our study on the pre-operative anesthetic consultation. After     recording and analyzing 50 consultations, we were able to identify the key points      to fulfill in order to meet users' acceptance. From this study, we propose some      strong recommendations to handle the constraints imposed by the      anesthesiologists' activity in their daily working environment. We applied this      method to evaluate an electronic patient record (EPR) for the pre-anesthetic      consultation. The results of this evaluation validate our hypotheses and the      importance of the activity constraints. In conclusion, human factors, and      particularly those linked with the activity of healthcare professionals, have to       be carefully studied before any development and installation of an EPR into a      specialty domain.

PMID- 11734382   - Successfully implementing patient care information systems (PCIS) in health care       organizations appears to be a difficult task. After critically examining the very      notions of 'success' and 'failure', and after discussing the problematic nature      of lists of 'critical success- or failure factors', this paper discusses three      myths that often hamper implementation processes. Alternative insights are      presented, and illustrated with concrete examples. First of all, the      implementation of a PCIS is a process of mutual transformation; the organization       and the technology transform each other during the implementation process. When      this is foreseen, PCIS implementations can be intended strategically to help      transform the organization. Second, such a process can only get off the ground      when properly supported by both central management and future users. A top down      framework for the implementation is crucial to turn user-input into a coherent      steering force, creating a solid basis for organizational transformation.      Finally, the management of IS implementation processes is a careful balancing act      between initiating organizational change, and drawing upon IS as a change agent,       without attempting to pre-specify and control this process. Accepting, and even      drawing upon, this inevitable uncertainty might be the hardest lesson to learn.

PMID- 11734381   - Healthcare institutions are looking at ways to increase their efficiency by      reducing costs while providing care services with a high level of safety. Thus,      hospital information systems have to support quality improvement objectives. The       elicitation of the requirements has to meet users' needs in relation to both the       quality (efficacy, safety) and the monitoring of all health care activities      (traceability). Information analysts need methods to conceptualise clinical      information systems that provide actors with individual benefits and guide      behavioural changes. A methodology is proposed to elicit and structure users'      requirements using a process-oriented analysis, and it is applied to the blood      transfusion process. An object-oriented data model of a process has been defined       in order to organise the data dictionary. Although some aspects of activity, such      as 'where', 'what else', and 'why' are poorly represented by the data model      alone, this method of requirement elicitation fits the dynamic of data input for       the process to be traced. A hierarchical representation of hospital activities      has to be found for the processes to be interrelated, and for their     characteristics to be shared, in order to avoid data redundancy and to fit the      gathering of data with the provision of care.

PMID- 11734380   - In spite of over four decades of research into Electronic Healthcare Record      Systems, the penetration of records which incorporate more than simply basic      information, into the working life of healthcare organisations is relatively      small. This paper discusses some of the key impediments to progress including in       particular, the lack of application of software engineering methodologies, the      absence of usable standards, and the failure to acknowledge the impact of record       systems on the healthcare system itself. However, Health Informatics researchers       need to be preparing for the next generation of systems which will be triggered      by the twin revolutions of the Internet and Genetic Medicine. This next      generation of EHCR will be a longitudinal cradle-to-the-grave active record      readily accessible and available via the Internet, and which will be linked to      clinical protocols and guidelines to drive the delivery of healthcare to the      individual citizen. Post-genomic research will unravel the link between genes,      disease, treatment and the environment and this information will be used to      promote health and individualise care. A number of key research issues are      identified which need to be addressed in order to realise the delivery of the      next generation of EHCR Systems.

PMID- 11734379   - Information management in hospitals is a complex task. In order to reduce      complexity, we distinguish strategic, tactical, and operational information      management. This is essential, because each of these information management      levels views hospital information systems from different perspectives, and      therefore uses other methods and tools. Since all these management activities      deal only in part with computers, but mainly with human beings and their social      behavior, we define a hospital information system as a sociotechnical subsystem      of a hospital. Without proper strategic planning it would be a matter of chance,       if a hospital information system would fulfil the information strategies goals.      In order to support strategic planning and to reduce efforts for creating      strategic plans, we propose a practicable structure.

PMID- 11734378   - The present study is a long-term review and follow-up on conclusions and      recommendations on the role and contents of a User Requirements Specification      Document (URD) from a previous in-depth case study. The follow-up comprises a      succession of investigations and two case studies to explore the role and      contents of a URD within systems development and assessment, thereby gradually      extending and refining the original recommendations. Finally, the recommended      three-layered structure and approach for a URD were applied in full scale within       a real-life project, in which the URD serves as the basis for a Call for Tender.       The preparation was entirely user-driven with the aid of a consultant for four     man months. The present paper outlines the essence of the approach and the      outcome of applying the recommended structure, with numerous examples of the      implications.

PMID- 11734377   - Medical informatics systems have the ultimate goal to improve the quality of      health care. However, these systems have also the potential to compromise the      quality of health care if they are misused, intrinsically faulty or entail      unexpected side effects. The purpose of the paper is to discuss examples from the      experience of the author, where well-intended medical informatic applications      proved to have potentially harmful effects or side effects. It is argued that      medical informaticians (MI) have an extended professional responsibility, which      covers not only the state of the art technical planning, an implementation of      information processing systems in medicine, but also the final result for the      patient. In order to discuss professional duties of medical informaticians, a      modification of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice      developed by ACM/IEEE is proposed as a guideline. For several examples, these      guidelines are used to analyze possible actions and professional responsibility.

PMID- 11673102   - The development of the ICUData patient data management system (PDMS) for     intensive care units (ICU), by IMESO GmbH, Huttenberg, Germany, was based on the       assumption that processes and therapies at ICU are the most complex with the      highest data density compared with those in other wards. Based on experience with      the system and on a survey conducted among users at our pain clinic, we evaluated      whether the concept of the present software architecture, which sufficiently      reproduces processes and data at an ICU, is suitable as a PDMS for general wards.      The highly modular and client-centric approach of the PDMS is founded on a      message-based communications architecture (HL7). In the beginning of the year     2000, the system was implemented at the pain management clinic (12 beds) of our     hospital. To assess its user friendliness, we conducted a survey of medical staff      (n=14). From April 1st 2000 to August 31st 2000, all clinical and administrative       data of 658 patients at the pain management clinic were recorded with the PDMS.      From the start, all users had access to data and information of other connected      data management systems of the hospital (e.g. patient administrative data,      patient clinical data). Staff members found the system mostly useful, clearly      presented, practical, and easy to learn and use. Users were relatively satisfied       with stability and performance of the program but mentioned having only limited      knowledge of the program's features. The need for external support during a      computer crash was rated negatively. Despite the need for further usage training       and improved program performance, the software architecture described seems to be      a promising starting point for the construction of a PDMS for general wards.

PMID- 11673101   - A review of evaluation literature concerning CDSSs indicates that randomized      controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the 'gold standard' for evaluation. While      this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not      well suited to answering questions concerning whether systems will be used or how      they will be used. Because lack of use of CDSS has been of concern for some      years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address those issues. This      paper critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents      alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of       the usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized       to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social,      organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these       studies go beyond the usual measures of systems performance or physicians'      behavior by focusing on 'fit' of the system with other aspects of professional      and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory that informs      many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations informed by social      science theories. Lastly, it proposes a theoretical social science base of social      interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It involves a CDSS in      psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control,      care, and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach also      is useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics      applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism,       the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of      methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational,      cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety       of research questions can increase understanding of many influences concerning      informatics applications development and deployment.

PMID- 11673100   - This paper reviews clinical decision support systems (CDSS) literature, with a      focus on evaluation. The literature indicates a general consensus that clinical      decision support systems are thought to have the potential to improve care.      Evidence is more equivocal for guidelines and for systems to aid physicians with       diagnosis. There also is general consensus that a variety of systems are little      used despite demonstrated or potential benefits. In the evaluation literature,      the main emphasis is on how clinical performance changes. Most studies use an      experimental or randomized controlled clinical trials design (RCT) to assess      system performance or to focus on changes in clinical performance that could      affect patient care. Few studies involve field tests of a CDSS and almost none      use a naturalistic design in routine clinical settings with real patients. In      addition, there is little theoretical discussion, although papers are permeated      by a rationalist perspective that excludes contextual issues related to how and      why systems are used. The studies mostly concern physicians rather than other     clinicians. Further, CDSS evaluation studies appear to be insulated from      evaluations of other informatics applications. Consequently, there is a lack of      information useful for understanding why CDSSs may or may not be effective,      resulting in making less informed decisions about these technologies and, by      extension, other medical informatics applications.

PMID- 11673099   - This article reports on our pilot evaluation of an electronic patient information      system for children with amblyopia and their parents. The aim was to investigate       whether the information system would be able to improve the quality of care, as      indicated by an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of care, and in      an increase in patient satisfaction. In the pilot evaluation, we used qualitative      research methods, exploring the impact of the information system on children and       their parents, with the aim to find suitable indicators for a potential further,       quantitative study. Yet we found that the system was little used and had marginal      effects on the quality of care for children with amblyopia and their parents. It       appeared that the main problem underlying this patient information system was      that the needs of those people who actually would be using the system had never     really been investigated. The designers had built their assumptions about these      needs into the system. These appeared to be mistaken at so many levels that the      system could not become a success. As a result of this pilot evaluation, the      patient information project was thoroughly transformed. This study makes clear     that a thorough exploration of user needs before building the system, using      qualitative research methods, may be crucial because it can prevent mismatches      and maximizes the chance that the eventual information system meets its most      important aim: to enhance patient empowerment and improve the quality of care.

PMID- 11518670   - Decision trees have been already successfully used in medicine, but as in      traditional statistics, some hard real world problems can not be solved      successfully using the traditional way of induction. In our experiments we tested      various methods for building univariate decision trees in order to find the best       induction strategy. On a hard real world problem of the Orthopaedic fracture data      with 2637 cases, described by 23 attributes and a decision with three possible      values, we built decision trees with four classical approaches, one hybrid      approach where we combined neural networks and decision trees, and with an      evolutionary approach. The results show that all approaches had problems with      either accuracy, sensitivity, or decision tree size. The comparison shows that      the best compromise in hard real world problem decision trees building is the      evolutionary approach.

PMID- 11518669   - This paper proposes to apply the theory of fuzzy sets in determining the severity      of respiratory distress of a patient in an intensive care unit. The problem is      modelled as a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making one. Theoretical approaches to       the situation are considered. The proposed fuzzy selection method, based on the      usage of the fuzzy intervals, is described. An example of determining the      severity of respiratory distress is used to illustrate the presentation. Computer     implementation of the model is considered, and the directions for possible      further work are pointed out.

PMID- 11518668   - Small changes that occur in a patient's physiology over long periods of time are       difficult to detect, yet they can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Detecting such      changes is even more difficult in intensive care unit (ICU) environments where      clinicians are bombarded by a barrage of complex monitoring signals from various       devices. Early detection accompanied by appropriate intervention can lead to      improvement in patient care. Neural networks can be used as the basis for an      intelligent early warning system. We developed time-delay neural networks (TDNN)       for classifying and detecting hemodynamic changes. A matrix of physiological      parameters were extracted from raw signals collected during cardiovascular     experiments in mongrel dogs. These matrices represented several episodes of      stable, decreasing, and increasing cardiac filling in normal, exerted, and heart       failure conditions. The TDNN were trained with these matrices and subsequently      tested to predict unseen cases. The TDNN perform remarkably not only in      identifying all hemodynamic conditions, but also in quickly detecting their     changes. On average, the networks were able to detect the hemodynamic changes in       less than 1 s after the onset. Based on the results of this pilot investigation,       the use of this form of TDNN to successfully predict hemodynamic conditions      appears to be promising.

PMID- 11518667   - In this article, we revise and try to resolve some of the problems inherent in      questionnaire screening of sleep apnea cases and apnea diagnosis based on      attributes which are relevant and reliable. We present a way of learning      information about the relevance of the data, comparing this with the definition      of the information by the medical expert. We generate a predictive data model      using a data aggregation operator which takes relevance and reliability      information about the data into account to produce a diagnosis for each case. We       also introduce a grade of membership for each question response which allows the       patient to indicate a level of confidence or doubt in their own judgement. The      method is tested with data collected from patients in a Sleep Clinic using      questionnaires specially designed for the study. Other artificial intelligence      predictive modeling algorithms are also tested on the same data and their     predictive accuracy compared to that of the aggregation operator.

PMID- 11518666   - The paper describes several types of efficiency enhancements of 'classical'      rule-based diagnostic expert systems. The blackboard control structure enables to      explore more knowledge bases of the same syntax in parallel, the taxonomy      structures make fast zooming of attention possible and provide additional      inference mechanism based on inheritance principles. The applicability of the      enhancing techniques is documented by four case studies exploring the extended      FEL-EXPERT shell in different tasks of medical decision-making. The authors      consider the enhancing techniques as useful steps on the way from 'classical'      diagnostic expert systems towards more complex multi-agent decision tools.

PMID- 11518665   - First generation expert systems were using shallow knowledge based on heuristic      information to solve a diagnostic problem. This approach has many disadvantages,       which can be avoided by using deep knowledge. Diagnostic reasoning based on deep       knowledge is called model-based diagnostics. Recently, the use of qualitative      modeling in relation to deep knowledge in expert systems has become increasingly       important. The main purpose of our contribution is to present the model-based      diagnostic approach at a formal level. The originality of the presented      formalization is the concept of the diagnostic space, the characterization of the      minimal diagnoses, and the measurement. The formalization serves as the      theoretical background to prove our view to the design of qualitative system      models and to establish the diagnostic architecture called DISY. The qualitative       system model in our diagnostic approach needs not to be specially adopted for use      in the diagnostic domain. The only requirement is that it must simulate the      system behavior expressed by normal or abnormal functioning of its components.      Proposed DISY architecture is not complex and simply takes into an account the      previous diagnostic result to obtain a new one from the additional      observation-measurement (medical tests or examinations) of the system.

PMID- 11518664   - In management of severe trauma patients, trauma surgeons need to decide which      patients are eligible for damage control. Such decision may be supported by      utilizing models that predict the patient's outcome. The study described in this       paper investigates the possibility to construct patient outcome prediction models      from retrospective patient's data at the end of initial damage control surgery by      using feature mining and machine learning techniques. As the data used comprises       rather excessive number of features, special attention was paid to the problem of      selecting only the most relevant features. We show that a small subset of      features may carry enough information to construct reasonably accurate prognostic      models. Furthermore, the techniques used in our study identified two factors,      namely the pH value when admitted to ICU and the worst partial active      thromboplastin time, to be of highest importance for prediction. This finding is       pathophysiologically reasonable and represents two of three major problems with      severe trauma patients, metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.

PMID- 11518663   - The initial diagnosis of bacterial infections in the absence of laboratory      microbiological data requires physicians to use clinical algorithms based on      symptoms, patient history and infection site. Optimization of such algorithms      would be achieved by including as many variables associated with bacterial      infection as possible. Demographic data are easily available and frequently used       to sub-group human populations. A prospective investigation was, therefore,      undertaken to examine the influence of demographic variables on bacterial      infection rates, using data obtained from 173 patients presenting to Albert      Einstein Medical Center. Data was randomly selected from 149 of these patients      and used to generate fuzzy rules to model an intelligent medical system. To test       the accuracy of this system at determining bacterial infection, based solely on      demographic data, the program was given the remaining 24 patients' information.      All 18 patients with either streptococcal, staphylococcal or Escherichia coli      infections were correctly diagnosed. Non-E.coli GNR were misdiagnosed as E. coli       infections in two patients resulting in an overall prediction rate for the 24      patients of 91.66%. This study suggests that the direct correlation of      demographic variables with a predisposition to bacterial infection allow the      design of an intelligent medical system, which shows great future potential as a       diagnostic tool for all physicians.

PMID- 11518662   - This paper proposes a hybrid expert system (HES) to minimise some complexity      problems pervasive to the artificial intelligence such as: the knowledge      elicitation process, known as the bottleneck of expert systems; the model choice       for knowledge representation to code human reasoning; the number of neurons in      the hidden layer and the topology used in the connectionist approach; the      difficulty to obtain the explanation on how the network arrived to a conclusion.       Two algorithms applied to developing of HES are also suggested. One of them is      used to train the fuzzy neural network and the other to obtain explanations on      how the fuzzy neural network attained a conclusion. To overcome these      difficulties the cognitive computing was integrated to the developed system. A      case study is presented (e.g. epileptic crisis) with the problem definition and      simulations. Results are also discussed.

PMID- 11518661   - In this paper, we highlight the involvement of Knowledge Management in a      healthcare enterprise. We argue that the 'knowledge quotient' of a healthcare      enterprise can be enhanced by procuring diverse facets of knowledge from the      seemingly placid healthcare data repositories, and subsequently operationalising       the procured knowledge to derive a suite of Strategic Healthcare Decision-Support      Services that can impact strategic decision-making, planning and management of      the healthcare enterprise. In this paper, we firstly present a reference      Knowledge Management environment-a Healthcare Enterprise Memory-with the      functionality to acquire, share and operationalise the various modalities of      healthcare knowledge. Next, we present the functional and architectural      specification of a Strategic Healthcare Decision-Support Services Info-structure,      which effectuates a synergy between knowledge procurement (vis-a-vis Data Mining)      and knowledge operationalisation (vis-a-vis Knowledge Management) techniques to      generate a suite of strategic knowledge-driven decision-support services. In      conclusion, we argue that the proposed Healthcare Enterprise Memory is an attempt      to rethink the possible sources of leverage to improve healthcare delivery,      hereby providing a valuable strategic planning and management resource to      healthcare policy makers.

PMID- 11502433   - Several empirical studies have shown that the use of computer-based information      systems could have positive impacts on organizational performance. Many agree to       say that health care organizations are no exceptions. But if one wishes to      identify the effects of information technology (IT) on the delivery of care, one       must be able to characterize IT for operationalization purposes. The primary      objective of this research project is to develop and validate a measurement      instrument of IT sophistication in the hospital milieu. Such instrument should      provide hospital managers with a diagnostic tool capable of indicating the      profile of their respective institutions in regard to IT adoption and comparing      this profile to those of other similar medical centers. Both qualitative and      quantitative data were collected in order to assess the psychometric properties      of the measurement instrument. Overall, findings suggest a high-moderate level of      functional sophistication, a somewhat low level of technological sophistication,       and an even lower level of integration sophistication in all of the sampled      medical centers. Hence, future investments shall therefore be directed towards      the integration of clinical and administrative applications and the acquisition      of more advanced technological devices, more specifically those, which allow      direct capture of clinical data at the bedside.

PMID- 11502432   - The study presented in this article represents the second phase in a multi-phased      research program focused on health care organization readiness for clinical      information technology/system (IT/S) innovation. The overall purposes of this      exploratory study were to: (1) validate the seven IT/S innovation readiness      sub-dimensions of a heuristic organizational information technology/systems      innovation model (OITIM) developed in phase one of the research program, and (2)       identify indicators to assess the validated sub-dimensions. The study was      conducted with an expert panel using a two-round modified Delphi technique. In      Round #1, panelists supported retention of the OITIMs' seven theoretical IT/S      innovation readiness sub-dimensions with an interrater agreement level range of      82-100%. Their sub-dimension importance ratings ranged from 3.27 to 3.72 (1=not      important to 4=critically important) with the resources sub-dimension receiving      the highest rating of 3.72. Panelists recommended that two sub-dimensions,      'Staffing and Skills' and 'Operations', be renamed to 'End-Users' and 'Management      Structures', respectively, and that one sub-dimension, 'Administrative Support'      be added. In Round #2, panelists identified a total of 316 indicators to assess      the eight sub-dimensions. A two-step thematic analysis process was done with      these indicators to reduce duplication and overlap. In Step 1, the investigator     created ten preliminary theme categories per sub-dimension. In Step 2, a coding      team categorized 279 (88%) of the 316 indicators into preliminary sub-dimension      themes to create an organizational IT/S innovation readiness assessment taxonomy.      This preliminary taxonomy was used to develop an organizational information      technology/systems innovation readiness scale that is currently being pilot      tested in phase three of the research program.

PMID- 11502431   - CONTEXT: We developed and evaluated the Emergency Department Expert Charting      System (EDECS) to provide real-time guidance regarding the care of low back pain       in adults, fever in children, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids       in health care workers, by embedding clinical guidelines within an electronic      medical record. OBJECTIVE: To describe the behaviors and attitudes of physicians       who used EDECS. DESIGN: Pre-post questionnaires were used to assess physician      attitudes. Time studies of the intervention phase were observational, using      clocks embedded in the software. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty two      residents and interns in emergency, pediatric, internal, and family medicine and       patients with the above-mentioned complaints. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician      utilization of EDECS, time spent using EDECS, physician satisfaction and beliefs.      RESULTS: Eighty four percent of the 142 eligible physicians used EDECS at least      once. Five hundred and ninety one of 789 (75%) eligible cases were completed      using EDECS. Median session time decreased from 12 min for session 1, to 5.5 min       for sessions 16 and above. Physicians generally agreed that care with EDECS was      better than standard care, particularly with respect to documentation. There was,      however, considerable heterogeneity in belief among complaints. CONCLUSIONS:      These data illuminate both the potentials of computer-assisted decision making      and the need for context-specific approaches when attempting to implement      guidelines.

PMID- 11502430   - Clinical practice guidelines provide a means to enhance physician performance.      This investigation was undertaken in an attempt to understand the nature of      impact of guideline use on physician performance. We investigated the impact of      (a) algorithmic-based and (b) text-based practice guidelines on clinical      decision-making by physicians at varying levels of expertise. Data were collected      using clinical scenarios and a think-aloud paradigm, both with (primed) and      without (spontaneous) the use of the guidelines. The two guidelines used in the      study were management of diabetes and screening for thyroid disease. The results       show that guidelines were used as reminders for both experts and non-experts.      Guidelines acted as an educational tool for non-experts by assisting in knowledge      reorganization, particularly for the non-experts. Text and algorithmic guideline       formats were both useful to physician performance depending on the purpose of      use: solving clinical problems or learning. These results provide insights into      how guidelines can be fine-tuned for different users and for different purposes.       Empirical research, coupled with design principles from the cognitive sciences,      can form an essential component of guideline design and development.

PMID- 11502429   - Moving window concepts are used in temporal query languages for aggregate      functions over the dimension 'time'. In the medical domain, aggregation of      patient data over time windows builds a powerful mechanism within clinical      database queries to satisfy a class of typical medical question formulations.      Contrary to other fields, like the business domain for example, there is the      additional need to synchronize time windows with the individual course of      diseases rather than with the calendar system only. In this paper, we present      several variants of shifting time windows over patient histories and suggest a      set of essential options for a moving window clause. The proposed parameters for       window creation as well as suitable default settings are discussed in the context      of retrieving data from medical records.

PMID- 11502428   - OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the results of parallel use of both paper based and      electronic patient records with respect to concordance of corresponding      information in two continuously updated versions of the same records. DESIGN:      retrospective evaluation of patient records, comparing documentation in      electronic and paper based patient records. SETTING: Department of Neurology in a      Norwegian university hospital using paper based and electronic patient records in      parallel during migration towards completely electronic patient records.      MATERIAL: electronic and paper based patient records of 90 randomly selected      patients visiting the department between 1 November 1997 and 30 April 1999.      RESULTS: seven percent of the electronic documents were significantly different      in some way from the corresponding paper documents. About 4-13% of the documents       in the electronic record were missing; one percent were missing from the paper     record. CONCLUSION: parallel use of electronic and paper based patient records      has resulted in inconsistencies between the record systems in our setting.      Documentation is missing in both the electronic and paperbased records. When      implementing electronic record systems intended to operate in parallel with      paperbased systems, focus should be on securing the validity of all versions of      the record.

PMID- 11470622   - Both keyboard-based and pen-based devices for data input have advantages and      disadvantages. The suitability of the two input devices for entering different      types of clinical data into computers remains unclear. This study aimed to      determine the usefulness of different types of technology for nurses' data entry       by comparing the utility and efficiency of keyboard and pen-based data input for       clinical tasks. The study was conducted in the six largest specialties of an      acute care hospital. In each specialty, several wards were randomly selected, and      all nurses working in these wards were invited to participate. The input      prototype was designed according to the type of text that was to be entered into       the system. Task 1 mainly consisted of structured data, Task 2 contained equal      amount of structured and textual data, and Task 3 was mainly in textual form.      Each nurse was asked to complete the three simulations of nursing records (Tasks       1, 2 and 3). Preliminary findings showed that nurses found the pen-based      interface easier to use than the keyboard for completing Tasks 1 and 2, but not      Task 3. In terms of accuracy, the nurses preferred the keyboard to the pen when      the data were more structured. The pen-based device is not a panacea for all      kinds of user interface, and more importantly, the choice of input device should       depend on the amount of structured and textual data.

PMID- 11470621   - The Internet is becoming a ubiquitous medium, open to all. The paper explores the      reasons why current health-related websites require extensive review and      investment to ensure that they address the full spectrum of the audiences who may      access their site. The audiences are no longer purely local or even solely those       who work in the health domain. They will include everyone, from professional      healthcare practitioners to members of the general public. The site web masters      should also consider the range of purposes for which these disparate groups      access the site. The language, content intensity and presentation should have a      different style and be identified by its intended audience to avoid a range of      problems including mis-interpretation, mis-targetting of content,      mis-representation of source and quality. Inappropriate content and presentation       could jeopardise the credibility of health sites, and thus healthcare provision,       with the newly emerging audiences. Recent studies involving the evaluation of      many web sites have assessed their 'fitness for purpose' as information      repositories for different audiences. The criteria by which clinically related      web contents are judged will vary, depending on the type of visitor to the site.       Formal qualification of web content is ongoing--addressing both structured      definition [1] and quality criteria [2]. Originators of web material should      consider the full spectrum of the audiences who may access their site, from      professional healthcare practitioners to members of the general public, and the      purposes for which they access the site. The language, content intensity and      presentation should have a different style and be identified by its intended      audience to avoid a range of problems including mis-interpretation,      mis-targetting of content, mis-representation of source and quality.

PMID- 11470620   - This study evaluated the impact of telemedicine technology on the provision of      neurosurgical health services. We focused on the differences between the use of      real time audio-visual teleconferencing and teleradiology versus conventional      telephone consultations in the referral of neurosurgical patients from a large      district general hospital. All patients requiring emergency neurosurgical      consultation were included for randomization into telephone consultation only      (Mode A), teleradiology and telephone consultation (Mode B) and      video-consultation (Mode C). Measures of effectiveness included diagnostic      accuracy and adverse events during the transfer and Glasgow Outcome Score. In a      10-month period, 327 patients were recruited and randomized into the study: the      male/female ratio was 2:1 and the number of patients required to be transferred      to the neurosurgical unit was 125 (38%). There was a trend towards a more      favourable outcome in the video-consultation mode (44%, Mode C), versus      teleradiology (31%, Mode B), versus telephone consultation (38%, Mode A). The      interim data of this prospective randomized trial suggests that      video-consultation may have a favourable impact on emergency neurosurgical      consultations.

PMID- 11470619   - Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic are a highly suitable and applicable basis for     developing knowledge-based systems in medicine for tasks such as the      interpretation of sets of medical findings, syndrome differentiation in Eastern      medicine, diagnosis of diseases in Western medicine, mixed diagnosis of      integrated Western and Eastern medicine, the optimal selection of medical      treatments integrating Western and Eastern medicine, and for real-time monitoring      of patient data. This was verified by trials with the following systems that were      developed by our group in Vietnam: a fuzzy Expert System for Syndromes      Differentiation in Oriental Traditional Medicine, an Expert System for Lung      Diseases using fuzzy logic, Case Based Reasoning for Medical Diagnosis using      fuzzy set theory, a diagnostic system combining disease diagnosis of Western      Medicine with syndrome differentiation of Oriental Traditional Medicine, a fuzzy       system for classification of Western and Eastern medicaments and finally, a fuzzy      system for diagnosis and treatment of integrated Western and Eastern Medicine.

PMID- 11470618   - The World Wide Web has become such an extensive health information repository in       the world that it is increasingly difficult to search for relevant medical      information. Many search tools have been developed to help users look for     relevant health information on the web, but most of them are still not efficient.      In this paper, we discuss some available on-line solutions to medical information      retrieval and compare the performances of some general and medicine-specific      search engines with the MediAgent, which has been developed by the National      University of Singapore (NUS) Medical Informatics Programme. Although a number of      medicine-specific searching techniques have been developed, the difficulty of      finding medical information still remains because medical search engines are      generally not as effective as generic search engines. Different from other search      tools, MediAgent's efficiency was quite high, taking only an average of 1.5 links      to retrieve the answers, but its retrieving effectiveness is not good enough due       to the short period of operation. Whilst the MediAgent project cannot claim to      have all the solutions, it nevertheless offers a new alternative to system      implementation. New techniques need to be explored in order to overcome the      issues of medical information retrieval on the Internet.

PMID- 11470617   - The objective of this study was to assess the current level of computerization in      clinical practice in Hong Kong through a population-based, physician survey      conducted in 2000.A self-completed, 20-question, postal questionnaire was sent to      4850 randomly selected doctors in Hong Kong. We received 897 completed responses.      Over one-third of doctors in the overall sample were already recording patient      summaries, processing laboratory results and specialist reports, and preparing      referral notes electronically. Patient registration (52.2%), billing systems      (40.2%), appointment scheduling (39.9%), and payroll (36.9%), were the commonest       administrative functions to have been computerized. Seventy per cent of doctors      in solo or small-group ('individual') practices did not yet have any clinical      function computerized compared with only 30.7% for those working in large,      corporate organizations. Similarly, approximately two-thirds of administrative      tasks in 'individual' clinics were not computerized, while corporate physicians      reported a corresponding percentage of 39.3%. Younger age, male gender,      specialist qualifications, more computers in the practice, higher numbers of      administrative tasks already computerized, higher levels of knowledge about and      positive attitudes towards computer applications in clinical practice were all      positively associated with more clinical tasks already computerized in the      practice. The present study has systematically documented the extent of clinical       computer use in Hong Kong and identified areas for improvement as well as      specific groups of physicians who might benefit from targeted efforts promoting      computerization in practice.

PMID- 11470616   - The computer-based Physician Order Entry System (POES) has been employed in many       clinical institutes in Taiwan. Most of the POES systems are developed in the      two-tier client-server architecture, and a large portion of the systems are      constructed on a mainframe or even a single PC. The exponential growth of the      Internet has had a tremendous impact on our society in recent years. In      consideration of the future user interface and system architecture, we have      developed a three-tier web-based Physician Order Entry System and successfully      deployed it in the Wang-Fang Hospital in Taipei. The system is the first POES      based on three-tier and World Wide Web (WWW) in Taiwan. The system provides the      Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) structure for the physician to      enter subject, object, diagnoses, medicine dosage, treatment and laboratory test       request, and prints out the prescription and necessary document. The doctor can      also retrieve the patient's medical record on the system. One of the special      characteristics of the system is its personalized design. The doctor can define      their own diagnosis, medicine and treatment database and any combination of these      to facilitate their clinical work. The system has been reviewed since February      1999. The result shows that the clinical procedure has become more efficient, and      the chances of omission have been reduced. The system is very stable and the Open      Database Connectivity (ODBC) database access did not show any delay in the      network. Since we have incorporated many new web-programming techniques, the      progress of the techniques will improve the system performance in the future.

PMID- 11470615   - Hospitals generate and store a large amount of clinical data each year, a      significant portion of which is in free text format. Conventional database      storage and retrieval algorithms are incapable of effectively processing free      text medical data. The rich information and knowledge buried in healthcare      records are unavailable for clinical decision-making. We examined a number of      techniques for structuring and processing free text documents to effective and      efficient for information retrieval and knowledge discovery. One critical success      criterion is that the complexity of the techniques must be polynomial both in      space and time for them to be able to cope with very large databases. We used      conceptual graphs (CG) to capture the structure and semantic      information/knowledge contained within the free text medical documents. Ordering       and self-organising techniques (lattice techniques and knowledge space) were used      to improve organisation of concepts from standard medical nomenclatures and large      sets of free text medical documents. Pair-wise union of CG was performed to      identify the common generalisation structure and a lattice structure of these CG       documents. A combination of all three techniques allowed us to organise a set of       9000 discharge summaries into a generalisation hierarchy that supported efficient      and rich information/knowledge retrieval.

PMID- 11470614   - Since its inception in 1990, the Hospital Authority (HA) has strongly supported      the development and implementation of information systems both to improve the      delivery of care and to make better information available to managers. This paper     summarizes the progress to date and discusses current and future developments.      Following the first two phases of the HA information technology strategy the      basic infrastructural elements were laid in place. These included the foundation       administrative and financial systems and databases; establishment of a wide area       network linking all hospitals and clinics together; laboratory, radiology and      pharmacy systems with access to results in the ward. A major push into clinical      systems began in 1994 with the clinical management system (CMS), which      established a clinical workstation for use in both ward and ambulatory settings.       The CMS is now running at all major hospitals, and provides single logon access      to almost all the electronically collected clinical data in the HA. The next      phase of development is focussed on further support for clinical activities in      the CMS. Key elements include the longitudinal electronic patient record (ePR),      clinical order entry, generic support for clinical reports, broadening the scope       to include allied health and the rehabilitative phase, clinical decision support,      an improved clinical documentation framework, sharing of clinical information      with other health care providers and a comprehensive data repository for analysis      and reporting purposes.

PMID- 11470613   - This study examined the characteristics of the knowledge discovery and data      mining algorithms to demonstrate how they can be used to predict health outcomes       and provide policy information for hypertension management using the Korea      Medical Insurance Corporation database. Specifically, this study validated the      predictive power of data mining algorithms by comparing the performance of      logistic regression and two decision tree algorithms, CHIAD (Chi-squared      Automatic Interaction Detection) and C5.0 (a variant of C4.5) using the test set       of 4588 beneficiaries and the training set of 13,689 beneficiaries. Contrary to      the previous study, the CHIAD algorithm performed better than the logistic      regression in predicting hypertension, and C5.0 had the lowest predictive power.       In addition, the CHIAD algorithm and the association rule also provided the      segment-specific information for the risk factors and target group that may be      used in a policy analysis for hypertension management.

PMID- 11340007   - Modern medical environments have seen an increase in technological complexity and      pressures of handling more patients with fewer resources, resulting in higher     demands on medical practitioners. Medical informatics designers will have to      focus on the problem of organizing medical information more effectively to enable      practitioners to cope with these challenges. This article addresses this research      problem for the particular area of medical problem solving in patient care.      First, we describe a traditional modeling approach for medical reasoning used as       a basis for developing some decision support systems. We argue these models may      be faithful to what is known about biomedical knowledge, but they have      limitations for human problem solving, especially in unanticipated situations.      Second, we present an ontological framework, known as the abstraction hierarchy      (Rasmussen, IEEE Trans. Man. Cybernetics 15 (1985) 234-243), for integrating      patient representations that are faithful to existing biomedical knowledge and      that are consistent with what is known about human problem solving. Through an      example of a critical event in the operating room, we reveal how this framework      can support medical problem solving in unanticipated situations. Third, we show      how to use these representations as a frame of reference for mapping medical      roles, responsibilities, sensors, and controls in an operating room context.      Finally, we provide some insight for medical informatics designers in using this       framework to design novel training programs and human-computer displays.

PMID- 11340006   - A toolset using object-oriented techniques including the nowadays popular unified      modelling language (UML) approach has been developed to facilitate the different       users' views for security analysis and design of health care information systems.      Paradigm and concepts used are based on the component architecture of information      systems and on a general layered security model. The toolset was developed in      1996/1997 within the ISHTAR project funded by the European Commission as well as       through international standardisation activities. Analysing and systematising      real health care scenarios, only six and nine use case types could be found in      the health and the security-related view, respectively. By combining these use      case types, the analysis and design of any thinkable system architecture can be      simplified significantly. Based on generic schemes, the environment needed for     both communication and application security can be established by appropriate      sets of security services and mechanisms. Because of the importance and the basic      character of electronic health care record (EHCR) systems, the understanding of      the approach is facilitated by (incomplete) examples for this application.

PMID- 11340005   - There has been a recent trend to gather and record more comprehensive and more      detailed personal medical information in computerized databases. Retrieval and      access are much easier from electronic records than from hard copies stored in      the archives of care-providing institutions. The Institute of Medicine voiced      concern that these developments raised numerous problematic issues, the most      disturbing of which is a much more widespread and systematic violation of privacy      via what they called 'authorized abuse', i.e. authorized users abusing their     access privileges. Other worries stemmed from the sharing of patient information       among different entities. Multitudes of organizations receive information about      patients' health records, often without their knowledge or consent. These include      care providers, insurers, pharmacists, employers, life insurance companies and      marketing firms. This article addresses the issues of medical data ownership and       some health data-recording problems to which we propose co-ownership and      co-documentation as part of the solution. We believe that a cooperative approach       will help to maintain greater accuracy of personal medical data, written in      language that can be shared and understood by the consumers and not one couched      in terminology understandable only to professional personnel and to delegate the       power to the patient to decide when and to whom to give authorization for its use      by a third party and for research.

PMID- 11340004   - In this paper, we propose a secure, distributed and scaleable infrastructure for       a lifelong personal medical record system. We leverage on existing and widely      available technologies, like the Web and public-key cryptography, to define an      architecture that allows patients to exercise full control over their medical      data. This is done without compromising patients' privacy and the ability of      other interested parties (e.g. physicians, health-care institutions,      public-health researchers) to access the data when appropriately authorized. The       system organizes the information as a tree of encrypted plain-text XML files, in       order to ensure platform independence and durability, and uses a role-based      authorization scheme to assign access privileges. In addition to the basic      architecture, we describe tools to populate the patient's record with data from      hospital databases and the first testbed applications we are deploying.

PMID- 11340003   - Clinical pathways are widely adopted by many large hospitals around the world in       order to provide high-quality patient treatment and reduce the length of hospital      stay of each patient. The development of clinical pathways is a lengthy process,       and may require the collaboration among physicians, nurses, and staffs in a      hospital. However, the individual differences cause great variances in the      execution of clinical pathways. It calls for a more dynamic and adaptive process       to improve the performance of clinical pathways. This paper reports a data mining      technique we have developed to discover the time dependency pattern of clinical      pathways for managing brain stroke. The mining of time dependency pattern is to      discover patterns of process execution sequences and to identify the dependent      relation between activities in a majority of cases. By obtaining the time      dependency patterns, we can predict the paths for new patients when he/she is      admitted into a hospital; in turn, the health care procedure will be more      effective and efficient.

PMID- 11340002   - The clinical information available to clinicians is expanding rapidly. It can      enhance clinical decision-making, but it can also confuse the process. To be most      useful, information should be available at the time and place it is needed and be      specific to the task at hand. In the new paradigm of medicine, one based on      continuous quality improvement, useful information must be relevant to both the      processes and outcomes of care. Clinical practice guidelines have become      increasingly popular for improving the quality of health care. The field of      medical informatics can bring cogent information to the point where decisions are      being made to augment quality improvement activities in general, and practice      guidelines in particular. However, such innovations are dependent on the type,      quantity, and quality of information available. This article discusses when      guidelines can enhance the quality and outcomes of care and how medical      informatics can help achieve these goals. In particular, the barriers to the      broad implementation of electronic medical records in a variety of health care      settings are explored.

PMID- 11311678   - Due to the inability to exchange clinical information among hospitals, continuity      of care cannot be maintained and a tremendous amount of medical resource has been      wasted. This paper describes an architecture that would facilitate exchange of      clinical information among heterogeneous hospital information systems. It is      dubbed 'Medical Information Exchange Center' or MIEC as part of a six-year Health      Information Network Project hosted by the Department of Health. MIEC was designed      so that it is innovative yet technically feasible today. It is convenient for     authorized users yet secure enough so people can trust and has minimal impact to       participated hospitals. Authorized users will be able to access information      through two web-based interfaces directed to physician and non-physician users      respectively. Hospitals are connected through a virtual private network to      exchange patient information and users need to obtain a private key from the      certificate authority in order to securely connect to MIEC. A pilot project was      conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture and the problems      encountered were discussed.

PMID- 11311676   - INTRODUCTION: As medical services improve due to new technologies and      breakthroughs, it has lead to an increasingly aging population. There has been      much discussion and debate on how to solve various aspects such as psychological,      socioeconomic and medical problems related to aging. Our effort is to implement a      feasible telegeriatric medical service with the use of the state of the art      technology to deliver medical services efficiently to remote sites where elderly       homes are based. Telegeriatric system will lead to rapid decision-making in the      presence of acute or subacute emergencies. This triage will also lead to a      reduction of unnecessary admission. It will enable the doctors who visit these      elderly homes on a once-a-week basis to improve their geriatric management skills      by communication with geriatric specialist. Nursing skills in geriatric care will      also benefit from this system. Integrated EMR service will be indispensable in      the face of emergency admissions to hospitals. Evolution of EMR database would      lead to future research in telegeriatrics and will help to identify the areas      where telegeriatrics can be optimally used. METHODOLOGY: This system is based on       current web browsing technology and broadband communication. EMR web based server     is developed using Java Technology. EMR database was developed using Microsoft      SQL server. Both are based at the Medical Informatics Programme, National      University of Singapore. Two elderly homes situated in the periphery of Singapore      and a leading government hospital in geriatric care has been chosen for the      project. These three institutions and National University of Singapore are      connected via ADSL protocol, which support high bandwidth, which is necessary for     high quality videoconferencing. Each time a patient needs a teleconsultation, a      nurse or doctor in the remote site sends the history to the EMR server. EMR     server forwards the request to the Alexandra Hospital for consultation.      Geriatrics specialists at Alexandra Hospital carry out teleward rounds twice      weekly and on demand basis. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Following the implementation of      the system, a trial run has been done. This shows a high degree of coordination      and cooperation between remote site and the Alexandra Hospital Also the patient      compliance is very high and they prefer teleconsultation. CONCLUSION: Initial      results show that telegeriatric system has definite advantages in managing      geriatric patients at a remote site. As the system evolves, further research will      show the areas where telegeriatrics can be used optimally.

PMID- 11311675   - During time-critical brain surgery, the detection of developing cerebral ischemia      is particularly important because early therapeutic intervention may reduce the      mortality of the patient. The purpose of this system is to provide an efficient      means of remote teleconsultation for the early detection of ischemia,      particularly when subspecialists are unavailable. The hardware and software      design architecture for the multimedia brain function teleconsultation system      including the dedicated brain function monitoring system is described. In order     to comprehensively support remote teleconsultation, multi-media resources needed       for ischemia interpretation were included: EEG signals, CSA, CD-CSA, radiological      images, surgical microscope video images and video conferencing. PC-based system       integration with standard interfaces and the operability over the Ethernet meet      the cost-effectiveness while the modular software was customized with a diverse      range of data manipulations and control functions necessary for shared workspace       and standard interfaces.

PMID- 11311674   - We started telemedicine projects from 1990 with a telepathology system within      Tsukiji Campus of National Cancer Center. In 1994, we connected Tsukiji Campus      and Kashiwa Campus by 6 Mbps optical fiber leased line using IP protocol for data      transmission, for teleconference, telepathology, and teleradiology projects. We      also started connection of regional cancer centers and are now forming a cancer     center network of 14 cancer centers. We are at present organizing 130      teleconferences per year with an attendance of more than 16000 people as summary.      We have also used a high-resolution image transferring system, such as SHD (2000       pixelsx2000 pixels resolution) system on one side, and an economical telemedicine      system using JAVA and a WWW browser (NCC_image) on the other side. We think that       providing information is another field of telemedicine. We began the experimental      gopher and WWW service in 1993. We are now providing official up-to-date cancer     information for patients and healthcare professionals. We are getting more than      400000 hits per month. We are also providing a teleconference video session which      is held every week on the Internet using a Real Video system with synchronized      slide presentation on the WWW browser. We are also organizing a Cancer Image      Reference Database System including DICOM images with viewer software. This paper     is a summary of the telemedicine projects performed at the National Cancer     Center.

PMID- 11311673   - In order to obtain appropriate medical care, patients can be referred or     transported from one hospital to another based on the capacity, capability and      quality of medical care provided by hospitals. Therefore, enabling patient care      records to be shared among hospitals is essential not only in delivering the      quality of medical care services but also in saving medical expenses. Currently,       most patient care records are paper-based and not well organized. Hence, they are      usually incomplete and can hardly be accessed in time. The authors in this paper       present methods to structure and represent patient care records, design      mechanisms for interpreting and integrating the XML-based patient care records      into the existing hospital information systems. More importantly, in our     approach, each significant piece of medical record is associated with a tag based      on the syntax and semantics of the XML. The XML-based medical records enable a      computer to capture the meaning and structure of the document on the web. The      authors have developed a unified referral information system in which patient      care records can be shared among hospitals over the Internet. It can not only      facilitate the referral process but also maintain the integrity of a patient's      medical record from distributed hospitals. The workflow of the system basically      follows the existing manual system and can easily be adapted. The working group      on integration of municipal hospital information systems, Department of Health,      Taipei City Government, has decided to adapt this system for referral practice      among the municipal hospitals.

PMID- 11311672   - In this article, we proposed a multifunctional telemedicine system supporting      both telediagnosis and teleconsultation services. We attempted not only to insure      that the implementation of this system satisfied most requirements, but also to      evaluate the impact of the system. With regard to system architecture, we      designed a unified multimedia database to store all types of data and used two      kinds of network (ATM and ISDN) for different possible applications. As for data       transmission, the REFRESH and PREFETCH mechanisms were implemented to enhance      data transfer efficiency. A total of 1107 consultations employing the      telemedicine system were performed during the past 3 years. This technology was      used most frequently for radiology consultation (32.7%, n = 362) and ultrasonic      examination (19.5%, n = 216). An evaluation of the impact on diagnosis (507 valid      cases) indicated that the diagnosis in 80 cases (15.78%) were altered on the      basis of second opinions from a medical center; and the number of patients      transferred to the medical center was reduced from 24 (4.7%) to eight cases. Most      of the rural-site physicians (97%) thought that they did benefit from      specialists' experience and knowledge via the telemedicine system. Based on 431      valid questionnaires, the number of the patients with confidence in the      telemedicine system at their local healthcare center increased from 72.6% to      87.5%. Overall, more than 90% of patients and physicians believed that the system      was valuable and provided satisfactory services.

PMID- 11311671   - In a pilot study of telemedicine in home health services (HHS) for elderly      patients, we implemented and evaluated a telemedicine system with a 33-kbs      narrow-band approach to determine its effectiveness in providing quality      services. Fifty patients were selected for the study. We found that telemedicine       was effective in terms of reducing the number of clinic visits and achieving      patient satisfaction. The average number of clinic visits per month was      significantly decreased from 0.64 to 0.42 (p < 0.05) after the use of      telemedicine. 72% of patients were satisfied with telemedicine, but only patient       location showed a significant difference for patient satisfaction (p < 0.05).      Patients in their homes (82%) were more satisfied than patients in nursing homes       (50%). Of four types of services provided, medical consultation (100%) was the      most highly satisfactory service with telemedicine, followed by physical therapy       (83.3%). Although the satisfaction scores did not indicate a significant      difference in the system characteristics, the quality of verbal communication      appeared to be a more important factor in influencing patient satisfaction than      set-up time or quality of image. A computer-based patient record was also      developed to view a patient summary and to document encounters at the patient's      home. Since the system is a low-cost approach that is easy to interface with a      notebook computer, it can support various other HHSs.

PMID- 11311670   - Teleradiology is yet to take off in India. This is unfortunate since this      technology is ideal for a country like India, where expertise in remote areas for     advanced investigations such as CT and MR, is lacking. We were the first center     in India to use teleradiology on a regular basis. Our initial methodology in 1996      was using video-capture cards and Windows 95 dial-up protocols. Now we use DICOM       transfers and remote-access software. Even today, 4 years later, we are the only       center in India using teleradiology on a regular basis.

PMID- 11311669   - Emergency ambulances traditionally inform receiving hospitals of impending      arrival of patients only in instances of load and go situations, which on average      constitute less than 5% of ambulance runs. Information transmitted is usually      sparse. For all other runs, information is made available only on arrival at the       emergency department (ED). There have also been numerous limitations associated      with voice transmissions.A comprehensive electronic ambulance case record was      created as a pilot project in Singapore between three emergency ambulances and      the busiest ED there. All information captured by the ambulance crew, including      vital signs information and ECGs was entered or downloaded onto a ruggardised PC       in the ambulance and this complete ambulance record was transmitted to the ED.      Transmission was wireless via the public mobile data network. A 3-month analysis       of this pilot run revealed the following. (1) It was possible to capture a      complete ambulance case record electronically at a mean time of 94 s vs 7 min 7 s      for the traditional written record. (2) Air transmission time for data was      approximately 4 s unless ECG wave forms were also transmitted resulting in      transmission times frequently exceeding 60 s. (3) At least 68% of data was      transmissible in 75% of Hospital & Emergency Ambulance Link (HEAL) ambulances as       opposed to only 25% in less than 5% of non-HEAL ambulances. (4) Paramedics' time       in the ED decreased from 15 to 8 min as a result of HEAL. (5) The waiting time      for critical care patients to be seen at the ED decreased from 35 to 17 min if      brought by HEAL ambulances.(6) The HEAL system was able to effectively prompt      paramedics in carrying out critical aspects of treatment in close to 100% of      instances. (7) The pilot HEAL system was able to demonstrate a limited amount of       automated audit of specific aspects of ambulance runs. Having demonstrated the      feasibility of the HEAL system, it is a matter of time before enhanced features      such as electronic data collection at patient site, voice activated data entry,      transmission of data from site, automated ambulance audits and an enhanced level       of professional care in the ambulances become common-place reality.

PMID- 11311668   - Telemedicine has been shown to have a considerable impact in medical education,      conferencing and consultation. As a result, the People's Republic of China has      been keen to develop telemedicine. In her attempts to further the development of       telemedicine, China has looked to the progress of medical services in Western      countries such as Europe and North America. The United States of America,      however, has exceeded the rest in exchange of health-care information and      telemedicine technologies with China. Although China has been enthusiastic about       the exchange, telemedicine in China requires development in the technical      infrastructure and professional infrastructure.

PMID- 11311667   - Telemedicine has always developed in close relation with communication      technology. When only aural telephones were used, several experiments of      telemedicine were carried out by utilizing telephone lines. When INS64 (ISDN with      64 kbits) and telecommunication satellites came onto the scene, experiments for     telemedicine began to be conducted accordingly using the cutting-edge technology       of the time. In this paper, one of the three categories of telemedicine, mainly      tele-consultation that includes tele-pathology and tele-radiology, will be      discussed with some examples conducted in Japan. As time goes on, the aim of      telemedicine has also been changing. In 1996, the Japanese government gave the go      ahead for telemedicine along its deregulation policies. Telemedicine including      tele-home care in the 21st century will use the Internet and digital HDTV      (high-definition TV) technology for information and data management      interchangeably both at domestic and global levels in the medical environment.      Also, our dream of a hyper-hospital or virtual hospital will be realized in      cyberspace before long, but first we may have to overcome several tough problems       such as the protection of privacy data, malpractice and vulnerability of      technology relevant to the Internet and telecommunications satellite system as a       whole.

PMID- 11311666   - Taiwan is a heavily populated country, with a small land area and many mountains       and isolated islands. Because medical resources are unequally distributed, high      quality accessible medical care is a major problem in rural areas. Medical      personnel are unwilling to practice in rural areas because of fear of isolation      from peers and lack of continuing medical education (CME) in those areas.      Telemedicine provides a timeless and spaceless measure for teleconsultation and      education. The development of telemedicine in Taiwan began under the National      Information Infrastructure (NII) Project. Distance education and teleconsultation      were the first experimental projects during the initiation research stage. The      cost and effectiveness of the hardware and network bandwidth were evaluated. In      the promotion research stage, applications in different medical disciplines were       tested to promote multipoint videoconference, electronic journals and VOD.      Investigation of user satisfaction put on more emphasis on improving application       functions. In 1998, a new Cyber Medical Center (CMC) international collaboration       project was begun, integrating technologies of multimedia, networking, database      management, and the World Wide Web. The aim of the CMC is to create a multimedia       network system for the management of electronic patient records,      teleconsultation, online continuing medical education, and information services      on the web. A Taiwan mirror site of Virtual Hospital and two international      telemedicine trials through Next Generation Internet (NGI) were done at the end      of 1998. In the future, telemedicine systems in Taiwan are expected to combine      the Internet and broadband CATV, ADSL, and DBS networking to connect clinics,      hospitals, insurance organizations, and public health administrations; and,      finally, to extend to every household.

PMID- 11311665   - The concept of telemedicine is rather new in Thailand and initially, the      introduction of telemedicine into the country was hampered by technological      limitations. The problem was further aggravated by the inadequacy of      telecommunications infrastructures in the rural areas. However, recent rapid      advances in info-communications technology, together with the launch of      Thailand's first communication satellite, THAICOM I in December 1993, have made      it possible for health care to be delivered to remote areas of the country via      telemedicine. This paper documents the experience of implementing Thailand's      nationwide Telemedicine Network by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH),      beginning with a pilot project in 1994 to the current system, launched in January      1998, that links the Information Technology Office of the MOPH and 19 hospitals      with health facilities all over the country via satellite and computer networks.

PMID- 11311664   - The people of Malaysia generally enjoy a high standard of health. This is largely      attributed to the comprehensive range of health services provided by the      Government and the private sector at affordable costs. However, there are      changing trends that now seriously challenge this status quo. The changing      population structure, lifestyle, disease patterns and globalization are causing      healthcare costs to rise. New and innovative ways will have to be devised to      further improve the health status and at the same time contain costs. Information      and Communication Technology (ICT) presents unprecedented opportunities to help      the health sector in Malaysia reinvent itself and transform the way health and      healthcare is managed and delivered in the future. Malaysia's Telehealth      initiative under the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project is designed to      realize Malaysia's health vision and goals and meet future health challenges.      Multimedia and Internet technology will be fully harnessed to deploy services      that will shift the emphasis from episodic management of illness to proactive      promotion of lifelong wellness and disease prevention. Health information content      and interactive applications will engage the people to work as partners of health      with healthcare professionals in maintaining their own health or managing their     illnesses.

PMID- 11311662   - Volunteer groups led by the Tokai University School of Medicine and the      Telemedicine Society of Japan (a Non-Governmental Organization) worked from 1992       to 1996 to successfully develop a medical network spanning the Asia Pacific      region using the ETS-V Satellite. The effort was part of the Partners project,      sponsored by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and the National       Space Development Agency of Japan. From 25 ground stations, links to the      telemedical network were installed at medical institutions at no cost. The      stations included five in Papua New Guinea, five in Thailand, four in Cambodia,      four in Fiji, one in China, and six in Japan. Designed exclusively for medical      applications, the network was operated free of charge for users at these sites.      While the 16-kHz FM-based (Frequency Modulation-based) network limited      applications to the transmission of color still images and audio and packet      networking, the project still achieved impressive results. The network allowed      liberal and independent use of international communications, local      communications, teleconferences, and teleconsultations, without requiring a hub      station.

PMID- 11248604   - Communication between patients and providers forms the backbone of the      patient-provider relationship. Often such communication is strained due to time      and space limitations on the part of both patients and providers. Many healthcare      organizations are developing secure e-mail communication facilities to allow      patients to exchange e-mail messages with their providers. Providers are worried       that opening such lines of communication will inundate them with vast quantities       of e-mail from their patients. Patients are worried that their messages will be      intercepted and read by unauthorized people. In an attempt to determine how a      group of internet-active, e-mail-ready patients currently use, or potentially      view, the ability to exchange e-mail messages with their health care providers,      we distributed a survey via e-mail to over 9500 patients. After determining each       patient's e-mail activity level (based on the number of messages sent each day),       we asked questions such as: "Have you ever sent e-mail to your provider?" "What      issues or concerns have prevented you from sending e-mail messages to your     provider?" "If your provider were to tell you that someone in his/her office may       screen, read or perhaps reply to your message before he/she sees it, to what      extent would you be concerned about this?" and "How would you rate your overall      satisfaction with the use of e-mail to communicate with your provider?" Results      from the survey indicate that nearly 85% of the patients surveyed send at least      one e-mail message per day, but that very few (i.e. 6%) of the patients have      actually sent an e-mail message to their provider. Interestingly, over half of      the patients indicated that they would like to send their providers e-mail, but      that they do not know their provider's e-mail address.

PMID- 11248603   - The World Wide Web provides an unprecedented opportunity for widespread access to      health-care applications by both patients and providers. The development of new      methods for assessing the effectiveness and usability of these systems is      becoming a critical issue. This paper describes the distance evaluation (i.e.      'televaluation') of emerging Web-based information technologies. In health      informatics evaluation, there is a need for application of new ideas and methods       from the fields of cognitive science and usability engineering. A framework is      presented for conducting evaluations of health-care information technologies that      integrates a number of methods, ranging from deployment of on-line questionnaires      (and Web-based forms) to remote video-based usability testing of user     interactions with clinical information systems. Examples illustrating application      of these techniques are presented for the assessment of a patient clinical      information system (PatCIS), as well as an evaluation of use of Web-based      clinical guidelines. Issues in designing, prototyping and iteratively refining      evaluation components are discussed, along with description of a 'virtual'      usability laboratory.

PMID- 11248602   - Slovenia initiated a nation-wide project to introduce smart cards in the health      sector in 1995 and its full-scale deployment started in September 2000. Although       the basic aim of the project was to support insurance related procedures, the      system was designed in a flexible and open manner to present an infrastructure      for the whole health sector. The functionality of the current system is described      in this paper along with lessons learned so far. The upgrade of the system is      outlined, with emphasis on technical details, the objective being to provide a      real-time EDI based environment for a general set of applications in the medical       sector, supported by the flexibility and security of modern smart card      technologies. Integration with similar systems in other EU countries is      discussed.

PMID- 11248601   - INTRODUCTION: In inpatients, computer monitors have been used to improve the      detection of adverse drug events (ADEs). However, similar programs have not been       available in outpatients. OBJECTIVE: To describe an approach for detecting      incidents suggesting that an ADE may have occurred in outpatients by adapting      methods from inpatient computer monitoring and developing terminology searches of      electronic medical records. METHODS: One year of information from the outpatient       electronic medical record (EMR) at one hospital and its clinics was reviewed.      Altogether, 23064 patients and 88514 visits were identified. Patient      demographics, medical problem lists, ICD-9 claims, patient allergies, medication       history and all clinic visit notes were extracted and merged. We then searched      for incidents suggesting that an ADE might be present using four methods: ICD-9      claims, new allergies, computer rules linking laboratory data to known medication      exposures, and a medical terminology lexicon (M2D2). In this report, we describe       how these search methods were developed to allow for ADE identification.      CONCLUSION: The ability to carry out such quality-related work is an example of      the benefits of the outpatient EMR that may not be apparent to those institutions      considering adopting it.

PMID- 11248600   - This paper presents a computerised information system for the characterisation      and analysis of the hospital admission flow of patients. Based on administrative       data made available by the Ministry of Health of Brazil (DATASUS-MS), the system       allows the representation of patients' flow from residence to hospital, as well      as information on performed medical procedures, diagnoses and other patient and      hospital characteristics. Residences are represented in terms of their postal      codes and admission diagnosis according to the ICD-10 classification. The system       has a flexible and simple geographic coordinates input module, and can be used      even when no standard coordinates system (e.g., Mercator) are available. It      provides two types of graphical representation: 'static' (concerning      characteristics of a hospital or geographical area) and 'dynamic' (residence to      hospital flow). Its use is exemplified with a geographical representation of      access to ultra-sound exams in selected hospitals in the city of Rio de Janeiro,       Brazil, July 1998. In conclusion, the system seems a powerful instrument for     health needs identification and planning, as well as for quality assessment and      for the generation of information useful for epidemiological research.

PMID- 11248599   - Healthcare delivery is being transformed by advances in e-health and by the      empowered, computer-literate public. Ready to become partners in their own health      and to take advantage of online processes, health portals, and physician web      pages and e-mail, this new breed of consumer is slowly redefining the      physician/patient relationship. Such changes can effect positive results like      improved clinical decision-making, increased efficiency, and strengthened      communication between physicians and patients. First, however, physicians and the      organizations that support them must fully understand their role in the e-health       revolution. Both must advance their awareness of the new consumers and their     needs and define specific action items that will help them realize the benefits      of e-health. Through a combination of timely research and advice, this article      will aid them in fulfilling both tasks.

PMID- 11156741   - Guidelines for the protection of electronic health care data frequently stipulate      that national laws should be followed. This stipulation is subjected to analysis       and critique. It is argued that it commits the fallacy of nationality, and      suggests that appropriately constructed ethical guidelines for the protection of       electronic health care data must focus solely on fundamental ethical principles      as these are applied to the types of situations in which such electronic data are      generated, used and ultimately disposed of. The relevance of economic      considerations is also be addressed. An attempt is made to sketch a general      ethical framework within which data protection guidelines could be situated.

PMID- 11156740   - We describe the Security Plan for the 'MyAngelWeb' service. The different actors       involved in the service are subject to different security procedures. The core of      the security system is implemented at the host site by means of a DBMS and      standard Information Technology tools. Hardware requirements for sustainable      security are needed at the web-site construction sites. They are not needed at      the emergency physician's site. At the emergency physician's site, a two-way      authentication system (password and test phrase method) is implemented.

PMID- 11156739   - Sensitive data are most often indirectly identifiable and so need to be rendered       anonymous in order to ensure privacy. Statistical methods to provide anonymity      require data perturbation and so generate data processing difficulties.      Encryption methods, while preserving confidentiality, do not require data      modification.

PMID- 11154973   - According to the Finnish National Fund for Research and Development in the      information society, knowledge is the basis of education and culture and the most      important production factor. ICT significantly promotes interaction and exchange       between individuals, business enterprises and other organisations, utilisation of      information, and provision of services and access to them. Our project is one of       approximately 300 projects which are developing seamless social and health care      ICT services in Finland [P. Ruotsalainen, Asiakaslahtoinen palveluketju ja      tietote-knologia, Kirjassa: Nouko-S. Juvonen, P. Ruotsalainen, I. Kiikkala      (toim), Hyvinvointivaltion palveluketjut. Hygieia. Kustannusosakeyhtio Tammi,      Tammer-Paino Oy, Tampere, 2000]. The principal aim is both to research and create      a new model for social and health care services and to disseminate the know-how      brought about for the benefit of software enterprises and educational institutes.      A product called Maternity Clinic on the Net is developed in the project, and it       can be applied to the national and international social and health care services.

PMID- 11154971   - Accepting the shared care paradigm, communication and co-operation required      between health care establishments must be provided in a trustworthy way. The      solution for establishing such trustworthy environment has to be based on a      common policy framework, on services, and mechanisms, which have been      standardised. In Europe, the legal framework, other policy issues, and the      services and mechanisms needed have been developed within projects launched by      the European Commission, by the European standards body CEN as well as by      temporarily established groups. Within the European TrustHealth projects. a      security infrastructure for trustworthy health telematics applications has been      specified, implemented, and evaluated. It is based on Health Professional Cards      and Trusted Third Party services. Experiences regarding organisational and      technological implications of the specification, implementation, maintenance, and      evaluation of such a security infrastructure are described on the basis of the      ONOCONET example. For the complete software lifecycle, the UML methodology has      been deployed.

PMID- 11154970   - It is becoming increasingly essential for individuals to be able uniquely to      identify themselves and each other, even where they may never meet. Access to and      use of privileges of membership, whether of a professional association, computer       network or health insurance policy depends upon the 'members' being able to prove      that they are who they say they are, frequently from a remote location. Patients       must be able both to claim their entitlements (e.g. insurance) and assemble their     confidential medical records wherever they are. Providers must be able to access       secured services and assert their privileges (e.g. issue prescriptions).      Institutions must be able to recognise both patients and providers and accord      them their due rights and privileges. To do this proof positive of who's who is      essential. Individuals need to be able to identify themselves quickly and easily       as 'club' members, this could be addressed by establishing sector-wide unique      identifier (UI) systems, although UI systems raise specific security issues.

PMID- 11154968   - Responding to the challenge for efficient and high quality health care, the      shared care paradigm must be established in health. In that context, information       systems such as electronic patient records (EPR) have to meet this paradigm      supporting communication and interoperation between the health care      establishments (HCE) and health professionals (HP) involved. Due to the      sensitivity of personal medical information, this co-operation must be provided      in a trustworthy way. To enable different views of HCE and HP ranging from      management, doctors, nurses up to systems administrators and IT professionals, a       set of models for analysis, design and implementation of secure distributed EPR     has been developed and introduced. The approach is based on the popular UML      methodology and the component paradigm for open, interoperable systems. Easy to      use tool kits deal with both application security services and communication      security services but also with the security infrastructure needed. Regarding the      requirements for distributed multi-user EPRs, modelling and implementation of      policy agreements, authorisation and access control are especially considered.      Current developments for a security infrastructure in health care based on      cryptographic algorithms as health professional cards (HPC), security services      employing digital signatures, and health-related TTP services are discussed. CEN       and ISO initiatives for health informatics standards in the context of secure and      communicable EPR are especially mentioned.

PMID- 11154967   - There have been two major approaches to the development of networked electronic      patient record (EPR) architecture. One uses object-oriented methodologies for     constructing the model, which include the GEHR project, Synapses, HL7 RIM and so       on. The second approach uses document-oriented methodologies, as applied in      examples of HL7 PRA. It is practically beneficial to take the advantages of both       approaches and to add solution technologies for network security such as PKI. In       recognition of the similarity with electronic commerce, a certificate authority      as a trusted third party will be organised for establishing networked EPR system.      This paper describes a Japanese functional model that has been developed, and      proposes a document-object-oriented architecture, which is-compared with other     existing models.

PMID- 11154966   - Security of information in the health care environment depends not so much on      technical controls as on compliance with policy by all those who use the      information. Awareness of policy and observance of a code of conduct, whilst      important, do not itself ensure that staff respect confidentiality, let alone      follow other measures to secure records. A culture of security must be developed       throughout the health care community. This demands clear policy with practical      procedures that are relevant in the workplace, a long-term programme in which      changes can be introduced in a managed way that is sensitive to the tensions      between security and other working practises, commitment from senior management      to achieve change, and strong leadership from within the health care professions.      The UK National Health Service has begun such a process with the endorsement of      the 'Caldicott Committee Report on the review of patient-identifiable      information' and its recommendation that all health organisations appoint a      senior health care professional to be responsible for confidentiality of patient       information. Raising the political profile of patient confidentiality has served       to change the rate of change up a gear. The response of one health care community      to this initiative will be discussed and lessons drawn regarding cultural change       and information security.

PMID- 11154965   - Recent advances in theories of learning and knowledge acquisition in      culturally-situated environments have illuminated the role of cognition in      changing behavior, and in turn on influencing performance for the long term. One       such advance focuses on the relationship between explicit formal training and      implicit knowledge acquired through daily interactive activities in schools and      organizations. The former relates more to instruction regarding the policy issues      whereas the latter is tied closely to cultural, moral and organizational values.       In this paper, we draw on these theories of cognition and learning to show the      shift in thinking that is needed regarding education of health professionals,      including steps required to assure that the protection of confidential      information becomes part of their routine practices. Illustrative examples are      used to show the nature of conceptual change in the health professional's      knowledge organization and reasoning strategies that is necessary for more      sustained behavior change with regards to protecting data confidentiality and      privacy of individual patients. This re-conceptualization is intended to be      reflected at various levels of training and education for health professionals,      including influences on personal and organizational practices as well as      revisions in medical-school and graduate-medical curricula.

PMID- 11154964   - The broader adoption of the EPR in healthcare settings has brought with it much      greater attention to the significant issues regarding security, confidentiality      and privacy of healthcare information. The economic, social and political impact       of these issues is also of major concern. In this paper, it is suggested that the      application of contemporary evolutionary game theory has high utility for     understanding the actual behaviour of stakeholders in such settings. Contemporary      evolutionary game theory can explain the effects of cultural norms, institutional      policies and economics on behavior. I also suggest that contemporary evolutionary      game theory is sufficiently robust as to be useful in the rational design of a      policy to encourage certain socially desired behaviour in this area.

PMID- 11154963   - In this paper, a methodology for determining the training needs of personnel      classes within health care establishments (HCEs) with respect to information      systems security is discussed. This methodology, in way of an example, is applied      to a particular class of HCE personnel, namely managers, whose training needs are      derived. Further, the ISHTAR training course on information systems security for       HCE managers is evaluated against these requirements and improvements to it are      proposed.

PMID- 11154962   - On April 22, 1999, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare proposed      electronic preservation of all clinical records. Simultaneously, deliberations on      legislation on data disclosure and privacy protection were held. To promote these      movements, electronic use of Personal Health Data (PHD) is indispensable, and the      system development is on its way to meet rising demands. Indigenous Japanese did       not have a word to describe the concept of privacy. It was only in the 1960s when      we became aware of that. In this article, the protection policy for data use will      be discussed from a Japanese perspective compared with those in other nations,      giving an example of the hospital management system under construction at the      Hiroshima University Hospital.

PMID- 11154961   - The growth of managed care and integrated delivery systems has created a new      commodity, health information and the technology that it requires. Surveys by      Deloitte and Touche indicate that over half of the hospitals in the US are in the      process of implementing electronic patient record (EPR) systems. The National      Research Council has established that industry spends as much as $15 billion on      information technology (IT), an amount that is expanding by 20% per year. The      importance of collecting, electronically storing, and using the information is      undisputed. This information is needed by consumers to make informed choices; by       physicians to provide appropriate quality clinical care: and by health plans to      assess outcomes, control costs and monitor quality. The collection, storage and      communication of a large variety of personal patient data, however, present a      major dilemma. How can we provide the data required by the new forms of health      care delivery and at the same time protect the personal privacy of patients?      Recent debates concerning medical privacy legislation, software regulation, and      telemedicine suggest that this dilemma will not be easily resolved. The problem      is systemic and arises out of the routine use and flow of information throughout       the health industry. Health care information is primarily transferred among      authorized users. Not only is the information used for patient care and financial      reimbursement, secondary users of the information include medical, nursing, and      allied health education, research, social services, public health, regulation,      litigation, and commercial purposes such as the development of new medical      technology and marketing. The main threats to privacy and confidentiality arise      from within the institutions that provide patient care as well as institutions      that have access to patient data for secondary purposes.

PMID- 11154960   - Effective security arrangements, which both protect and assure those information       assets of healthcare providers, doctors and patients, are fundamental      requirements in a modern electronic healthcare culture. At the heart of      healthcare information systems in future will be those infrastructure components       and services, which underpin the principles of confidentiality, integrity and      availability. Before embarking upon any major implementation of cryptographic      support services, there are a number of critical policy issues, which must first       be considered and addressed. To address these successfully will maximise the      potential values of these services and facilities to their users on a broad      front. A primary consideration for all information security projects, is the need      to establish clear scope and objectives for the security services to be      implemented. When considering the policy, scope and design implications of a      large scale cryptography programme, a number of external issues also need to be      considered not least of which are the legal liabilities, implications and      obligations of the country or countries where the system(s) will operate. Where      such legislation exists, regulatory arrangements may potentially influence how      secure information sharing across international healthcare boundaries can be      achieved.

PMID- 11154957   - The term electronic patient record (EPR) means the electronic collection of      clinical narrative and diagnostic reports specific to an individual patient. A      true EPR should allow physicians and nurses to practice in a paperless fashion.      The wide adoption of Internet technologies should allow truly distributed sharing      of patient data across traditional organizational barriers. Hence, the meaning of      an EPR, as a representation of documents, should be transformed into a      collaborative environment that supports workflow, enables new care models and      allows secure access to distributed health data. This paper reviews the current      realization of EPRs in the context of paper-based medical records. The Internet      architecture that Boston-based medical informatics researchers refer to as      W3-EMRS is described in the context of a successful implementation of CareWeb at       the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center. Finally, we describe how this      Internet-based approach can be extended beyond the boundaries of traditional care      settings to help evolve new collaborative models of eHealth.

PMID- 11154972   - We describe the Security Plan for the 'MyAngelWeb' service. The different actors       involved in the service are subject to different security procedures. The core of      the security system is implemented at the host site by means of a DBMS and      standard Information Technology tools. Hardware requirements for sustainable      security are needed at the web-site construction sites. They are not needed at      the emergency physician's site. At the emergency physician's site, a two-way      authentication system (password and test phrase method) is implemented.

PMID- 11154969   - Sensitive data are most often indirectly identifiable and so need to be rendered       anonymous in order to ensure privacy. Statistical methods to provide anonymity      require data perturbation and so generate data processing difficulties.      Encryption methods, while preserving confidentiality, do not require data      modification.

PMID- 11154958   - Guidelines for the protection of electronic health care data frequently stipulate      that national laws should be followed. This stipulation is subjected to analysis       and critique. It is argued that it commits the fallacy of nationality, and      suggests that appropriately constructed ethical guidelines for the protection of       electronic health care data must focus solely on fundamental ethical principles      as these are applied to the types of situations in which such electronic data are      generated, used and ultimately disposed of. The relevance of economic      considerations is also be addressed. An attempt is made to sketch a general      ethical framework within which data protection guidelines could be situated.

PMID- 11137474   - OBJECTIVES: The Clinical data repository (CDR) at the University of Virginia      Health System is a data warehouse that provides direct access to data for     clinical research and effective decision making. We undertook an evaluation of      the CDR to understand factors affecting its adoption. DESIGN: We used a      theoretical framework that is based on diffusion of innovation theory. Building      on validated survey instruments, we developed a questionnaire and conducted      interviews of key executive leaders. Fifty-three individuals with logon ids to      the CDR completed our questionnaire. Twelve executive leaders were interviewed.      MEASUREMENTS: The outcome variables were the initial and continued use of the      CDR. Independent variables included attributes suggested by diffusion theory      (i.e. relative advantage, complexity), knowledge and skills expected to correlate      with computer usage, and the influence of communication channels. RESULTS: Our     overall response rate was 82%. We identified characteristics of users associated       with the initial decision to use the CDR. Compatibility with an individual's      skills and work style was associated strongly with satisfaction and continued      use. Secondly, the importance of organizational culture and the need for data was      illuminated by management interviews. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that diffusion      of innovation theory can be used to help understand factors contributing to the      success of a data warehouse in a healthcare setting. Our results suggest areas      for future research and inquiry as the CDR evolves.

PMID- 11137473   - In this study measurements obtained from brain-stem trigeminal evoked potentials       (BTEP) are applied to the problem of diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and      Post-concussion syndrome (PCS). We present a simplistic model that depicts the      BTEP waveform as the linear combination of a set of filters excited by a short      stimulus. The relation between the BTEP latencies and the 1st to 4th harmonic      components is shown. The performance of a fuzzy similarity measure based      classifier is compared with that of human experts. The efficiency of the proposed      classifier in conjunction with delay time and amplitude features is examined.      Using this novel approach, a classification rate of 93.55% and 84.1% for MS and      PCS pathologies, respectively, was achieved. This performance compares favorably       to the classification rates of 84.28% for MS and 70.47% for PCS pathologies      achieved by human experts.

PMID- 11137472   - Based on the component paradigm for software engineering as well as on a      consideration of common middleware approaches for health information systems, a      generic component model has been developed supporting analysis, design,      implementation and harmonisation of such complex systems. Using methods like      abstract automatons and the Unified Modelling Language (UML), it could be shown      that such components enable the modelling of real-world systems at different      levels of abstractions and granularity, so reflecting different views on the same      system in a generic and consistent way. Therefore, not only programs and      technologies could be modelled, but also business processes, organisational      frameworks or security issues as done successfully within the framework of      several European projects.

PMID- 11137471   - Computer-based systems may be able to address a recognised need throughout the      medical profession for a more structured approach to training. We describe a      combined training system for neuroradiology, the MR Tutor that differs from      previous approaches to computer-assisted training in radiology in that it      provides case-based tuition whereby the system and user communicate in terms of a      well-founded Image Description Language. The system implements a novel method of       visualisation and interaction with a library of fully described cases utilising      statistical models of similarity, typicality and disease categorisation of cases.      We describe the rationale, knowledge representation and design of the system, and      provide a formative evaluation of its usability and effectiveness.

PMID- 11137470   - The explosive increase in the power of computers has enabled the creation of      fast, interactive 3D environments, sometimes called virtual reality (VR). This      technology, often associated with arcade games, is increasingly being used for     more serious applications. This paper describes research showing transfer of      skills from a virtual environment to the real world. We then describe our VR     authoring tool and an application to help cognitively impaired individuals      relearn important daily living skills. Additionally we describe the development      of a prototype networked system to enable a doctor to monitor remotely the      rehabilitation of a group of patients.

PMID- 11137469   - The aim of this paper is to point out the difference between static and dynamic      approaches to choosing the optimal time for intervention. The paper demonstrates       that classical approaches, such as decision trees and influence diagrams, hardly       cope with dynamic problems: they cannot simulate all the real-world strategies      and consequently can only calculate suboptimal solutions. A dynamic formalism      based on Markov decision processes (MPPs) is then proposed and applied to a      medical problem: the prophylactic surgery in mild hereditary spherocytosis. The      paper compares the proposed approach with a static approach on the same medical      problem. The policy provided by the dynamic approach achieved significant gain      over the static policy by delaying the intervention time in some categories of      patients. The calculations are carried out with DT-Planner, a graphical decision       aid specifically built for dealing with dynamic decision processes.

PMID- 10978929   - This paper describes a continuous effort to improve the knowledge of nursing      informatics among German nurses. The authors have co-operated in the nursing      informatics working group of the German Medical Informatics Association GMDS.      Besides, one of the authors has been active in the European summer school of      nursing informatics (Essoni) for several years. The authors have now established       a national counterpart to the Essoni program, the German summer school of nursing      informatics. This event in German language is centred around nursing informatics       topics. Students may opt for one of the several study tracks to gain insight in      topics such as nursing classifications and nursing terminologies, clinical      information systems and their implementation or teaching requirements in nursing       informatics. They go through a 5-day curriculum consisting of plenary sessions,      lectures and opportunities for self learning and self teaching. At the end they      demonstrate to the fellow students from the other tracks what they have achieved       in their own field of study. The German Summer School is open to interested      nurses, nurse executives and nurse teachers. In this paper, we will describe the       curriculum, talk about the participants and show results of the      questionnaire-based evaluation for the first two events in 1998 and 1999.

PMID- 10978928   - This study is concerned with the application of advanced multimedia technology to      the development of a programme aimed at raising awareness of information and      communications technology (ICT) amongst health professionals in Ireland. The      programme is delivered in the form of a symposium supplemented by a multimedia CD      and associated web site. It examines how ICT can be used effectively in      healthcare across all sectors - primary, secondary and tertiary - with a strong      emphasis on supporting shared care. The aim is to empower users to make informed       technological choices and to actively participate in the exploitation of ICT in      the health sector. The programme was successfully completed and delivered to over     2300 health professionals across Ireland and follow-up activities include the      active encouragement of leaders and champions within the sector. This will be      supported by interactive web-based education and training material focused on      specialised topics of particular interest within the broader context of      continuing medical education (CME).

PMID- 10978927   - With the delivery of distance (or flexible) learning in today's society, the      changing roles of both the teacher and the learner need to be seriously      considered. This is particularly relevant with the use of new technologies to      deliver courses in locations with entirely different cultural and academic      traditions. International education of this kind currently faces difficulties in       facilitating cross-cultural learning. While problems of limited communications      technologies, lack of teacher training, inadequate competence of university      administration and general cultural differences may be known, global changes call      for the development of new pedagogies with new communication technologies in      ways, which are sensitive to issues of cultural diversity.

PMID- 10978926   - A Delphi study was accomplished on the topic "what is needed to implement the      information society within healthcare? and which research topics should be given       higher priority than other topics to achieve the desired evolution?", involving      29 international experts. The study comprised of four phases, (I) a brainstorming      phase based on a open question; (II) an evaluation phase for mutual commenting;      (III) a feedback phase allowing corrections/extensions; and (IV) a phase      collecting the ratings of individual issues within a questionnaire synthesised      from the previous phases. A total of 110 research items and 58 supplementary      barriers were raised, divided into 14 topics grouped according to homogeneity.      The emphasised research topics are business process re-engineering, the      electronic patient record and connected inter-operating systems, (support for)      evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines, and education. Issues inherent      to the healthcare domain often are the kernel of the research recommended.      Similarly, methods and 'people'-issues are strongly emphasised among the research      issues in general and among those for which the experts' joint opinion was rated       as statistically significant. In contrast, only a minority of the research issues      emphasised was related to technical issues.

PMID- 10978925   - We present a knowledge management and decision support methodology for insulin      dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients care. Such methodology exploits the      integration of case based reasoning (CBR) and rule based reasoning (RBR), with      the aim of helping physicians during therapy planning, by overcoming the      intrinsic limitations shown by the independent application of the two reasoning      paradigms. RBR provides suggestions on the basis of a situation detection      mechanism that relies on formalized prior knowledge; CBR is used to specialize      and dynamically adapt the rules on the basis of the patient's characteristics and      of the accumulated experience. When the case library is not representative of the      overall population, only RBR is applied to define a therapy for the input      situation, which can then be retained, enriching the case library competence. The      paper reports the first evaluation results, obtained both on simulated examples      and on real patients. This work was developed within the EU funded telematic      management of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (T-IDDM) project, and is fully       integrated in its web-based architecture.

PMID- 10978924   - The usefulness of imputation in the treatment of missing values of an      otoneurologic database for the discriminant analysis was evaluated on the basis      of the agreement of imputed values and the analysis results. The data consisted      of six patient groups with vertigo (N=564). There were 38 variables and 11% of      the data was missing. Missing values were filled in with the means, regression      and Expectation-Maximisation (EM) imputation methods and a random imputation      method provided the baseline results. Means, regression and EM methods agreed on       41-42% of the imputed missing values. The level of agreement between these and      the random method was 20-22%. Despite the moderate agreement between the means,      regression and EM methods, the discriminant functions were similar and accurate      (prediction accuracy 83-99%). The discriminant functions obtained from the      randomly imputed data were also accurate having prediction accuracy 88-97%.      Imputation seems to be a useful method for treating the missing data in this      database. However, a lot of data was missing in otoneurologic tests, which are      likely to be of less importance in the diagnosis of vertiginous patients.      Consequently, the disagreement of the methods did not affect clearly the      discriminant analysis, and, therefore, future research requires more complete      data and advanced imputation methods.

PMID- 10978923   - In this article we describe a real-time automated reminder system that has been      developed to change Family Physicians' (FP) test ordering behavior. The system      focuses on the appropriateness of test requests. We aim at using the system as a       substitute for written feedback by human experts. The reminder system consists of      a knowledge base, an order entry system and modules to provide passive and active      support in the form of reminders to FPs. The system generates critical comments      about the rationality of the test requests at the moment the FP orders a test      that is not in line with national or regional guidelines. For the first      validation of the knowledge base we compared the comments of a human expert to      the comments of the reminder system on three random samples of test requests. The      overall agreement in the subsequent validation rounds was 46, 60 and 69%. The      corrections made in the knowledge base after each validation round resulted in a       reminder system with 149 reminders concerning various medical problems. Due to      the corrections in the knowledge base the reminder system reacts better over the       subsequent validation rounds.

PMID- 10978922   - This paper illustrates the implementation of a computerized guideline for     pressure ulcer prevention. In particular, it describes the aspects related to the      site-specification of a guideline delivered by the Agency for Health Care Policy       Research (AHCPR), to its integration with the electronic patient record, and to      its implementation within the clinical routine. The primary goal of the system is      both to facilitate nurses assessing the risk of ulcer development, and to manage       patients at risk by producing daily prevention work-plans. Concerning this      functionality, particular attention has been paid to manage nurse's      non-compliance with the guideline suggestions and to collect data for evaluating       the guideline impact. Moreover, since it is well known that nurses are often      over-loaded, the human computer interaction has been studied in such a way to      optimise the time spent for data input. An additional functionality of the system      is the novice nurses' education - they can browse a graphical representation of      the guideline, asking details about the different tasks, and they can simulate      patients to obtain real-time advice. The educational tool is written in Java and       it is based on a representation of the guideline as a relational database. A      preliminary evaluation of the system has been performed and the results are      presented on the management of about 40 patients.

PMID- 10978921   - Hierarchical decision models are a general decision support methodology aimed at       the classification or evaluation of options that occur in decision-making      processes. They are also important for the analysis, simulation and explanation      of options. Decision models are typically developed through the decomposition of       complex decision problems into smaller and less complex subproblems; the result      of such decomposition is a hierarchical structure that consists of attributes and      utility functions. This article presents an approach to the development and      application of qualitative hierarchical decision models that is based on DEX, an       expert system shell for multi-attribute decision support. The distinguishing      characteristics of DEX are the use of qualitative (symbolic) attributes, and      'if-then' decision rules. Also, DEX provides a number of methods for the analysis      of models and options, such as selective explanation and what-if analysis. We      demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of the approach presenting four     real-life applications of DEX in health care: assessment of breast cancer risk,      assessment of basic living activities in community nursing, risk assessment in      diabetic foot care, and technical analysis of radiogram errors. In particular, we      highlight and justify the importance of knowledge presentation and option      analysis methods for practical decision-making. We further show that, using a      recently developed data mining method called HINT, such hierarchical decision      models can be discovered from retrospective patient data.

PMID- 10978920   - A computer system of PCs, workstations, minicomputers etc. connected together via      a local area network or wide area network represents a large pool of      computational power. Our aim is to use this power for the implementation of an      E(3) (efficiency, effectiveness, efficacy) medical decision support system, which      can be based on different models, the best providing an explanation together with      an accurate and reliable response. One of the most viable among models is      decision trees, already used for many medical decision-making purposes. In this      paper, we present a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm on a      heterogeneous computing system for the induction of decision trees with the      application on solving the mitral valve prolapse syndrome. Our approach can be      considered as a good choice for different real-world decision making, with      respect to the advantages of our model, especially the great computational power.

PMID- 10978919   - The DIOGENE hospital information system has been expanded with a centralized and       integrated patient clinical database recording structured patient data. The      objective is to provide a standardized framework for the building of future      clinical databases and for the integration of existing heterogeneous ones. The      combined 'across time view' and 'across departments view' generated from the      integrated clinical data will enable an evolutionary view of the patient state,      both across time and across medical specialties. For this purpose and to permit      the communication and exchange of data, a new controlled vocabulary for     representing clinical data has been created. The construction of this vocabulary       is based on the international ICD classification, already being used in DIOGENE      for encoding patient diagnosis and procedures. A new extension of the ICD is      proposed for medical information that goes beyond diagnosis and procedures      encoding. The building of a common clinical findings dictionary, recording the      definition of clinical entities, is based on this newly developed clinical      vocabulary. This process is incremental, manual and substantial.

PMID- 10978918   - Interoperability is a key issue and a long-term domain of research for     distributed healthcare information systems. The SynEx European project provides      open and standard integration platform for both new and legacy medical      applications. It aims to provide access to hospital information services, patient      records, and to medical knowledge, in a seamless way, hiding the distribution      aspects and the heterogeneity of the underlying systems. In this study, we      describe the SynEx 'mediator service', a software engineering component, that is       used to facilitate the development of mediators between any pair of SynEx      components and to manage the corresponding interchange messages. Both a C++      library and a Java package of a generic mediator model are provided with several       ready-to-use specialisations for well-defined use. The use of the XML technology       as a powerful data interchange format and as an efficient data structure      converter is proposed and discussed.

PMID- 10978917   - The Steiermarkische Krankenanstaltenges. m.b.H (KAGes) is a company, owned by the      province of Styria in Austria, which operates 21 hospitals with about 8000 beds      and 14000 employees, serving a population of ca. 1.2 million people. KAGes has      purchased a new hospital information system (HIS) for its hospitals. Within the      strategic IT plan and the 'system structure new' (SSN) project, a methodology was      developed for making an effective HIS purchase. Several steps of this project are      described in the paper, request for product information, evaluation of vendor     proposals, product presentations, test site evaluation, reference site visits and      selection of vendor finalists. The authors present the internal project      management methodology, including the structure of the project team, project      information management through intranet, criteria for different steps of the      evaluation and evaluation site organization. Four major HIS vendors with leading       HIS products qualified for this stage of the project (evaluation site). About 60       teams with 400 members (end users and IT-experts) have assessed all the products       installed, during one or more, repeated test sessions. The decision on which new       HIS to purchase were based on the recommendations derived from this evaluation.      After completing SSN-project with the suggestion to KAGes-top-management for     negotiations with two vendor finalists, the new project named MEDOCS was started       mid-1999. Two pilot installations (one general hospital and one teaching hospital      department) are nowadays in the pilot implementation and subsequent roll-out      (including substitution of the legacy system) is scheduled until the year 2003.

PMID- 10978916   - Most often the investment in electronic patient records (EPR) is decided upon on       the basis of descriptions of all the advantages this new technology will bring.      We argue that an exchange of a paper-based patient record (PPR) with an EPR is an      efficient way to automate manual routine work and distribute information but the       real benefits from EPR depend on how clinicians use an EPR application to improve      the quality of care. We introduce the 'price to pay' concept in order to      illustrate that it takes a human effort to create better health care and that      clinicians therefore play a very important role when implementing EPR systems.

PMID- 10978915   - This article presents an electronic patient record (EPR) for stroke patients. At       the neurology department of the Maastricht University Hospital, coordination and       communication of the multidisciplinary team for stroke patients is intended to be      supported by an EPR. Existing, structured, paper nursing and medical records      served as a starting point for the development of the EPR. In close cooperation      with future users, the database structure, and data entry and data retrieval      aspects of the user interface were adapted to the domain of stroke. The result is      a combined electronic medical and nursing record that has potential to improve      record keeping and to truly support daily routines. The challenges encountered in      the development process were maintaining continuous user involvement and      conflicting points of view regarding the relevance of clinical data.      Conclusively, we state that intensive user participation improved the EPR,      coupling with the existing hospital information system and other systems will be       advantageous and the fact that the paper records were structured in advance will       smooth the unavoidable changes in work patterns.

PMID- 10978914   - In this article the paper record and its position in work practices is discussed,      and is related to the situation at an inpatient clinic for which an electronic      patient record (EPR) is in development. In addition reported research on      innovations is discussed. An analysis of 42 clinical paper records gave insight      into existing problems with paper records. The current work practices were      analysed based on two periods of observations in the ward and eight in-depth      interviews with questions about their daily work, communication in the ward and      the role of the paper record in communication. The results indicate that several       problems described in the literature were recognised only for a part of the      medical and nursing records. One probable cause of insufficient communication      between health care workers appeared to be the internal organisation of the paper     records. The fact that the experimental EPR system will be small-scaled,      introduces specific problems regarding communication with other departments that       still work with paper records. Nevertheless, we conclude that also an electronic       patient record designed for a specific setting has the potential to improve      record keeping and communication between health care workers.

PMID- 10978913   - This paper presents the authors' experience with the development and use of a      document-centered electronic patient record (EPR) in a large teaching hospital.      The development of the document-centered EPR began with the formulation of a set       of critical hypotheses to facilitate both the continuation of the best medical      practice and the implementation and use of the EPR. An alternate and more      conventional approach - the data-centered EPR - is compared with the      document-centered EPR. Various benefits and pitfalls are discussed. Finally, the       choice was to offer both solutions in a tightly linked system. The need for an      EPR which combines the document and data centered approaches is a reflection of      the more general discussion of what the medical record will be in the future. All      too often, the need for structured data conflicts with the need for free texts      and the power of expression. It is not easy to evaluate the consequences of this       initial decision. However, changing the foundations of the EPR after its      implementation is difficult and expensive. Therefore, the selection of the      correct orientation in a given hospital requires a broad-based discussion.

PMID- 10978912   - The increasing availability of machine-readable medical documents is not really      matched with the sophistication of currently used retrieval facilities to deal      with a variety of critical natural language phenomena. Still most popular are      string-matching methods which encounter problems for the medical sublanguage, in       particular, concerning the wide-spread use of complex word forms such as noun      compounds. We introduce a methodology for the segmentation of complex compounds      into medically motivated morphemes. Given the sublanguage patterns in our data      these morphemes derive from German, Greek and Latin roots. For indexing and      retrieval purposes, such a morpheme dictionary may be further structured by      defining the semantic relations among morpheme sets in order to build up a      multilingual morpheme thesaurus. We present a tool for thesaurus compilation and       management, and outline a methodology for the proper construction and maintenance      of a multilingual morpheme thesaurus.

PMID- 10978911   - Generalised architecture for languages, encyclopedia and nomenclatures in      medicine (GALEN) has developed a new generation of terminology tools based on a      language independent model describing the semantics and allowing computer     processing and multiple reuses as well as natural language understanding systems       applications to facilitate the sharing and maintaining of consistent medical      knowledge. During the European Union 4 Th. framework program project GALEN-IN-USE      and later on within two contracts with the national health authorities we applied      the modelling and the tools to the development of a new multipurpose coding      system for surgical procedures named CCAM in a minority language country, France.      On one hand, we contributed to a language independent knowledge repository and      multilingual semantic dictionaries for multicultural Europe. On the other hand,      we support the traditional process for creating a new coding system in medicine      which is very much labour consuming by artificial intelligence tools using a      medically oriented recursive ontology and natural language processing. We used an      integrated software named CLAW (for classification workbench) to process French      professional medical language rubrics produced by the national colleges of      surgeons domain experts into intermediate dissections and to the Grail reference       ontology model representation. From this language independent concept model      representation, on one hand, we generate with the LNAT natural language generator     controlled French natural language to support the finalization of the linguistic       labels (first generation) in relation with the meanings of the conceptual system       structure. On the other hand, the Claw classification manager proves to be very      powerful to retrieve the initial domain experts rubrics list with different      categories of concepts (second generation) within a semantic structured      representation (third generation) bridge to the electronic patient record      detailed terminology.

PMID- 10978910   - Frequency spectrum of surface electromyographic signals (SEMGs) exhibit a      non-stationary nature even in the case of constant level isometric muscle      contractions due to changes related to muscle fatigue processes. These changes      can be evaluated by methods for estimation of time-varying (TV) spectrum. The      most widely adopted non-parametric approach is a short time Fourier transform      (STFT), from which changes of mean frequency (MF) as well as other parameters for     qualitative description of spectrum variation can be calculated. Similar idea of       a sliding-window generalisation can also be used in case of parametric spectrum      analysis methods. We applied such approach to obtain TV linear models of SEMGs,      although its large variance due to independence of estimations in consequent      windows represents a major drawback. This variance causes unrealistic abrupt      changes in the curve of overall spectrum dynamics, calculated either as the      second derivative of the MF or, as we propose, autoregressive moving average      (ARMA) distance between subsequent linear models forming the TV parametric      spectrum. A smoother estimation is therefore sought and another method shows to      be superior over a simple sliding window technique. It supposes that trajectories      of TV linear model coefficients can be described as linear combinations of known       basis functions. We demonstrate that the later method is very appropriate for     description of slowly changing spectra of SEMGs and that dynamics measures      obtained from such estimations can be used as an additional indication of the      fatigue process.

PMID- 10978909   - A semi-automatic system for determining volumes of interest (VOI) from positron      emission tomography (PET) scans of brain is described. The VOIs surface      extraction is based on user selectable threshold and three-dimensional target      flood-fill. Contrast to anatomical volume detection approaches, volumes are      determined from functional PET images and the obtained objects are checked      against anatomical images. The developed VOI program was evaluated with brain      FDOPA-PET studies where the striatum was the object. The results were comparable       to entirely manual method and the target extraction time is reduced to about one       third of manual method.

PMID- 10978908   - New Internet technologies offer excellent chances to build high-quality on-line      learning media for the education in medicine. Especially, the teaching of      diagnostics with medical imaging as well as medical image processing can be      supported by the excellent visualization and interaction capabilities. In      cooperation with three radiological departments at German universities in Munich,      Erlangen and Wurzburg, the case-based open distributed Internet text book      (ODITEB) for tumor diagnosis of the GI-tract, liver, pancreas and thorax has been      developed at the Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Epidemiologie (IMSE) of       the Technische Universitat Munchen. It offers a big collection of clinical tumor       cases located on servers at the provider sites Munich, Erlangen and Wurzburg,      visualization and interaction similar to a real CT or MRI console, original DICOM      data, X-rays and endoscopic and endosonographic videos, and expert-guided tours      through the cases. In a first evaluation in summer 1998, 32 medical students      graded the application with 1.9 ('good') on a scale from 1 ('very good') to 5      ('very bad'). The textbook supports German language, an English version is in      preparation. In a second part, it contains lessons in medical image processing      for students of medical informatics. An ODITEB release 2 with several      improvements will be finished until February 2000. The use of the textbook is      free of cost.

PMID- 10978907   - Many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures depend on medical images. In order to       overcome imperfections of the obtained images, which are due to the acquisition      process, and to extract new information from the available images, many      techniques have been developed. In this study, a new method of image segmentation      and 3D reconstruction based on active contour models ('snakes') was applied in      analyzing computed tomography (CT) images in patients with acute head trauma.      Using this method, lesion to brain (LBR) and ventricle to brain ratio (VBR)      parameters, as well as 3D reconstruction of traumatic lesion, was obtained      accurately. In our study group, 215 patients (mean age 42.4+/-23.5 years, 138/215      (64.2%) males) were included. Among them, 72 (33.5%) did not survive during      hospitalisation in the Emergency Department. LBR correlated with the Glasgow Coma      Score and the intrahospital outcome (r=-0.457 and r=0.515, respectively).      Besides, non-survivors had greater LTB values (0.042+/-0.034) than survivors      (0.005+/-0.011). However, VBR did not correlate with these clinical parameters.      In addition, LBR was significantly higher in the patients with other pathologic      CT findings. The proposed methodology, based on extracting maximum information      from available CT scans, could be a basis for further medical decision making in       patients with acute head trauma.

PMID- 10978906   - The introduction of virtual reality techniques in medicine opens up new      possibilities for the planning of interventions. The presented software system      for virtual operation planning in orthopaedic surgery (VIRTOPS) enables the      virtual preoperative 3D planning and simulation of pelvis and hip operations. It       is used to plan operations of bone tumours with endoprosthetic reconstruction of       the hip based on multimodal image information. The operation and the      endosprothetic reconstruction of the pelvis are simulated using virtual reality      techniques. Stereoscopic visualisation techniques and 3D input devices support      the 3D interaction with the virtual 3D models. The main task of the preoperative       planning process is the individual design of an anatomically adaptable modular     prosthesis. The placement and the design of the endoprosthesis are supported by      different functions and visualisation techniques. The resulting 3D images and      movies can be used for the documentation of the operation planning procedure, as       well as, for the preoperative information of the patient.

PMID- 10978905   - The wider use of telematics in public health and patient care will be a very      important strategy for Member States, and one that can help bring expert      knowledge to new areas and institutions in a cost-effective and rapid manner.      However, such a strategy should take into account a number of elements that are      given below. Health telematics systems and services should be dictated by health       need s and by clinical and public health standards, not be technology-driven. The      values and principles of Health for All (HFA), notably equity, sustainability,      participation and accountability, should apply fully to the development of health      telematics. Health telematics requires new skills from the relevant      decision-makers , operators and users, calling for a mix of participatory      education, skills training, continuing professional education and lifelong      learning. Given the fast rate of technological obsolescence and changing      price-performance ratios, countries will benefit from closer collaboration on the      development of technological standards, compatibility, open architecture,      competitive prices and pilot applications. Managing health information      developments in an effective and rational way at the level of the European Region      will require the major organizations active in this field to enter into more      formal agreements of cooperation than is the case today; most importantly, this      will involve World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and      Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

PMID- 10978904   - The information revolution has, till now, concentrated on the collection,      storage, transfer, and analysis of data, with emphasis on the technology and not       on the information itself. Information in health care is conductive to two major       changes. One aspect is the conversion of clinical medicine from an art, based on       clinical intuition to a more scientific profession based on clinical guidelines      and evidence based medicine. The second aspect relates to health care policy      based on better information.

PMID- 10974641   - OBJECTIVE: To obtain insight into the effects of electronic communication on GPs       by studying those publications in literature describing the effects of structured      electronic clinical communication in general practice. METHODS: We retrieved all       publications in the English language indexed in MEDLINE under the MESH term      'Computer Communication Networks' AND having either 'family practice' or 'primary      health care' as MESH term OR 'GP', or 'GPs' as text word. RESULTS: A total of 176      publications were retrieved of which 30 publications met the criteria. In 28 of      these 30 publications potential effects were described; one described claimed      effects, three described demonstrated effects with subjective data and five      described demonstrated effects with objective data. The studies documented,      furthermore, effects on the speed of communication, the content of information      and records, a change of processes involved in the communication, quality of      care, costs, workload of physicians, appreciation of physicians, confidentiality,      and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that only a few studies evaluated      electronic communication versus paper communication. Of these studies, only a few      report improvement. Our final conclusion is that, so far, literature has not      shown that the positive effects can be explained by electronic communication as      such.

PMID- 10974640   - This paper presents a prototype of a computer-aided design (CAD) diagnostic      system for mammography screening to automatically detect and classify      microcalcifications (MCCs) in mammograms. It comprises four modules. The first      module, called the Mammogram Preprocessing Module, inputs and digitizes      mammograms into 8-bit images of size 2048x2048, extracts the breast region from      the background, enhances the extracted breast and stores the processed mammograms      in a data base. Since only clustered MCCs are of interest in providing a sign of       breast cancer, the second module, called the MCCs Finder Module, finds and      locates suspicious areas of clustered MCCs, called regions of interest (ROIs).      The third module, called the MCCs Detection Module, is a real time computer     automated MCCs detection system that takes as inputs the ROIs provided by the      MCCs Finder Module. It uses two different window sizes to automatically extract      the microcalcifications from the ROIs. It begins with a large window of size      64x64 to quickly screen mammograms to find large calcified areas, this is      followed by a smaller window of size 8x8 to extract tiny, isolated      microcalcifications. Finally, the fourth module, called the MCCs Classification      Module, classifies the detected clustered microcalcifications into five      categories according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) format      recommended by the American College of Radiology. One advantage of the designed      system is that each module is a separate component that can be individually      upgraded to improve the whole system. Despite that it is still is a prototype      system a preliminary clinical evaluation at TaiChung Veterans General Hospital      (TCVGH) has shown that the system is very flexible and can be integrated with the      existing Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) currently implemented      in the Department of Radiology at TCVGH.

PMID- 10974639   - Mosoriot Health Center is a rural primary care facility situated on the outskirts      of Eldoret, Kenya in sub-Saharan Africa. The region is characterised by      widespread poverty and a very poor technology infrastructure. Many houses do not       have electricity, telephones or tap water. The health center does have      electricity and tap water. In a collaborative project between Indiana University       and the Moi University Faculty of Health Sciences (MUFHS), we designed a core      electronic medical record system within the Mosoriot Health Center, with the      intention of improving the quality of health data collection and, subsequently,      patient care. The electronic medical record system will also be used to link      clinical data from the health center to information collected from the public      health surveys performed by medical students participating in the public health      research programs of Moi University. This paper describes the processes involved       in the development of the computer-based Mosoriot medical record system (MMRS) up      to the point of implementation. It particularly focuses on the decisions and      trade-offs that must be made when introducing this technology into an established      health care system in a developing country.

PMID- 10974638   - The present investigation concerns methodological and epidemiological aspects of       the transferability of artificial neural network-based algorithms, as      key-components for classification in decision support systems (DSS). The      prevalence of pathological conditions to be detected must be known in order to      tune an artificial neural networks (ANN)-decision algorithm so that the      predictive values of the outcome fulfil medical requirements. Another aspect of      transferability, when clinical laboratory results are used, concerns differences       in analytical performance of measuring instruments. The relative bias between two      instruments is not known exactly, but must be estimated and corrected for. A      general method, based on original measured data sets and statistical modeling,      was developed for simulating the impact of various correction procedures when      using different analytical instruments. The simulation methodology was applied to      a real clinical problem of ruling-in/ruling-out of patients with suspected acute       myocardial infarction (AMI) by biochemical monitoring. The recommended correction      procedure was based on method comparison with use of five duplicate measurements       on a common set of patient samples covering the relevant measuring interval.      Transferability of laboratory data over time was also studied. The design of      quality assurance procedures should be based on analytical quality requirement      specifications related to medical needs. Limits of critically sized systematic      errors were assessed by calculating the decrease in diagnostic performance of the      ANN-algorithm as a result of temporary analytical disturbances. The consequences       for the design of QA procedures was illustrated. It is concluded that the actual       ANN-decision algorithm for early assessment of chest-pain patients should be      possible to transfer to new sites under realistic conditions.

PMID- 10961573   - A methodology for selecting, training and estimating the performance of adequate       artificial neural network (ANN) structures and incorporating them with algorithms      that are optimized for clinical decision making is presented. The methodology was      applied to the problem of early ruling-in/ruling-out of patients with suspected      acute myocardial infarction using frequent biochemical monitoring. The selection       of adequate ANN structures from a set of candidates was based on criteria for     model compatibility, parameter identifiability and diagnostic performance. The      candidate ANN structures evaluated were the single-layer perceptron (SLP), the      fuzzified SLP, the multiple SLP, the gated multiple SLP, the multi-layer     perceptron (MLP) and the discrete-time recursive neural network. The      identifiability of the ANNs was assessed in terms of the conditioning of the      Hessian of the objective function, and variability of parameter estimates and      decision boundaries in the trials of leave-one-out cross-validation. The commonly      used MLP was shown to be non-identifiable for the present problem and available      amount of data, despite artificially reducing the model complexity with use of      regularization methods. The investigation is concluded by recommending a number     of guidelines in order to obtain an adequate ANN model.

PMID- 10961572   - This article considers the problem of identifying patients in one or more      heterogeneous personal databases. The unambiguous identification of patients is      an essential prerequisite for an efficient patient care system. We discuss the      problems involved in this task and suggest how they can be dealt with. The      solution of automatic consolidation of patient records sequires programming,      organisational and work psychology measures. Following a survey of conventional      identification methods, the method developed at the Department of Medical      Computer Sciences, which is based on the current clinical situation at the      General Hospital in Vienna (AKH--Allgemeines KrankenHaus), is described in      detail. The basic principle is to identify patients unambiguously by means of an       ID (IZAHL) derived directly from the personal data. Thereby a deterministic      technique without probability weighting is used-all compared information must      correspond completely. The article closes with a critical survey of experience      gathered to date.

PMID- 10961571   - The aim of this paper is the presentation of a new version of the anesthesia      documentation software, NarkoData, that has been used in routine clinical work in      our department as part of an anesthesia information management system (AIMS)      since 1995. The performance of this software is presented along with requirements      for future development of such a system. The originally used version, NarkoData      3.0, is an online anesthesia documentation software established by the software      company ProLogic GmbH. It was primarily developed as a disk-based system for the       MacOS operating system (Apple Computer Inc.). Based on our routine experience      with the system, a catalogue of requirements was developed that concentrated on      improvement in the sequence of work, administration and data management. In 1996,      the concepts developed in our department, in close co-operation with medical      personnel and the software company, led to a considerable enlargement of the      program functions and the subsequent release of a new version of NarkoData. Since      1997, more than 20 000 anesthesia procedures have been recorded annually with      this new version at 115 decentralized work stations at our university hospital.

PMID- 10961570   - The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA) version 2.1      (V2.1) was released in March 1999 accompanied by the MedDRA/J V2.1J specifically       for Japanese users. In prescription-event monitoring in Japan (J-PEM), we have      employed the MedDRA/J for data entry, signal generation and event listing. In      J-PEM, the lowest level terms (LLTs) in the MedDRA/J are used in data entry      because the richness of LLTs is judged to be advantageous. A signal is generated       normally at the preferred term (PT) level, but it has been found that various      reporters describe the same event using descriptions that are potentially encoded      by LLTs under different PTs. In addition, some PTs are considered too specific to      generate the proper signal. In the system used in J-PEM, when an LLT is selected       as a candidate to encode an event, another LLT under a different PT, if any, is      displayed on the computer screen so that it may be coded instead of, or in      addition to, the candidate LLT. The five-level structure of the MedDRA is used      when listing events but some modification is required to generate a functional      event list.

PMID- 10961569   - This paper highlights the benefits of combining the World Wide Web and smart card      technologies to support a highly mobile health management framework. In      particular, we describe an approach using the SmartCard-Web Gateway Interface      (SGI) as a common interface to communicate and access the medical records      residing in a smart card. Importantly, by employing HTTP as the baseline protocol      to access information on the smart card, SGI promotes the use of de facto      standard web browsers as the common client user interface. The initial      implementation of the framework has demonstrated the feasibility of the concept      in facilitating a truly mobile access of patient's medical records based on SGI.

PMID- 10961568   - CoMed is a prototype of a real-time collaborative medicine system that allows      medical specialists to share patient records and to communicate with each other     on the Internet. CoMed consists of a multimedia medical database containing      relevant information about laryngeal diseases and a real-time collaboration      system including a teleconferencing system, a whiteboard and a chatting system.      CoMed is web-based. We adopted the object database O2 and CORBA technologies for       the multimedia medical database. Therefore, our system can provide the      flexibility, extensibility and location transparency of patient databases. We      developed a SeeYou Active X control for the teleconferencing system and a Java      applet for the whiteboard and chatting system. CoMed improves the efficiency of      the overall system by separating the servers on a UNIX machine and a Windows NT      machine. CoMed can be utilized for stand-alone research, for collaborative      consultations among medical specialists and for a telemedicine in participation      with the patients and medical specialists. Our system can be extended easily into      other types of the collaborative systems, such as collaborative distance      learning, collaborative science system, etc.

PMID- 10961567   - The design, implementation, and utilization of an electronic medical record      system (EMRS) in a pediatric psychopharmacology clinic is described. The EMRS is       a relational database with information entered directly by the clinician during a      patient visit. It has been used during more than 2590 patient visits with 805      patients. Complete clinical documentation and simultaneous data entry as well as       computer generated prescriptions for the patient were accomplished 75% of the      time within a 20-min medication management session. One hundred consecutive      parents of patients were asked to fill out a five-question survey to begin to      assess the impact of the application. Of the 87 parents who responded, all (100%)      noted that the doctor paid attention to their concerns. Between 88 and 90% of the      parents reported that the use of the computer is a 'good' thing, made it easier     to work with the doctor, and that they understood why the computer was being      used. The findings support that the development and implementation of an EMRS      with direct clinician information entry within pediatric psychopharmacology      clinic, is feasible.

PMID- 10961566   - Modern health care institutions are often multi-site organisations that implement      heterogeneous information management systems interacting with distributed      databases. Advances in treatment modality/technology and rapidly changing      information technology create increasing demand for changes/redevelopment of many      health information applications. These features spawn the need for solutions to      (a) guarantee data exchange across different types of applications and database      management systems, and (b) reduce the costs of systems development and      modification. This paper explores the concept of 'middleware services' as a      solution to achieve these goals. It reports on the successful application of a      component-based 3-tier system architecture to develop a computerised clinical      pathways management system. The implementation experience confirms a number of      significant benefits of the 3-tier structure including, reusability, flexibility,      significant reduction in costs and efforts of systems development, and provision       of easy, open migration pathway for future change of technology and system      redevelopment.

PMID- 10961565   - Electronic medical record (EMR) systems have much potential, however, there are      still a number of issues that need to be resolved before EMRs are widely      accepted. One of these issues is the data input task, a potentially serious      practical barrier to on-line medical computer usage. This paper reports the      empirical modelling of data input requirements for physicians who use a      problem-orientated medical record system. Three statistical models (Bayesian      conditional probability, multiple linear regression and discriminant analysis) to      predict drug treatment given problem diagnoses are derived from EMRs of 2500      general Practice encounters. Two metrics are used to measure the predictive power     of the models considering both the number of drugs correctly predicted and the      strength with which the models predict them. The models are tested on 500 unseen       records from the same patient-physician population and the data used to build the      models. The Bayesian model produces the best predictions on unseen data and is      also the easiest model to compute. A prototype interface that enables new patient      cases to be entered is constructed to demonstrate how the predictive power of the      model can translate into benefits in the data entry task.

PMID- 10708255   - The current status of our work towards the design and implementation of a      reference architecture for a Clinical Information System is presented. This      architecture has been developed and implemented based on components following a      strong underlying conceptual and technological model. Common Object Request      Broker and n-tier technology featuring centralised and departmental clinical      information systems as the back-end store for all clinical data are used. Servers      located in the 'middle' tier apply the clinical (business) model and application       rules to communicate with so-called 'thin client' workstations. The main      characteristics are the focus on modelling and reuse of both data and business      logic as there is a shift away from data and functional modelling towards object       modelling. Scalability as well as adaptability to constantly changing      requirements via component driven computing are the main reasons for that      approach.

PMID- 10708254   - A number of quantitative models including linear discriminant analysis, logistic       regression, k nearest neighbor, kernel density, recursive partitioning, and      neural networks are being used in medical diagnostic support systems to assist      human decision-makers in disease diagnosis. This research investigates the      decision accuracy of neural network models for the differential diagnosis of six       erythematous-squamous diseases. Conditions where a hierarchical neural network      model can increase diagnostic accuracy by partitioning the decision domain into      subtasks that are easier to learn are specifically addressed. Self-organizing      maps (SOM) are used to portray the 34 feature variables in a two dimensional plot      that maintains topological ordering. The SOM identifies five inconsistent cases      that are likely sources of error for the quantitative decision models; the lower       bound for the diagnostic decision error based on five errors is 0.0140. The      traditional application of the quantitative models cited above results in      diagnostic error levels substantially greater than this target level. A two-stage      hierarchical neural network is designed by combining a multilayer perceptron      first stage and a mixture-of-experts second stage. The second stage      mixture-of-experts neural network learns a subtask of the diagnostic decision,      the discrimination between seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis rosea. The      diagnostic accuracy of the two stage neural network approaches the target      performance established from the SOM with an error rate of 0.0159.

PMID- 10708253   - Mobile information and communication systems in clinical routine have the      potential to greatly improve communication, facilitate information access,      eliminate double documentation, and increase quality of patient care in the long       run. Projects to date have focused, for the most part, on highly specialized      applications of the mobile computer. In our research project, 'Cooperative      Problem Solving in Health Care', we have, among other things, designed a      multifunctional mobile information and communication assistant. A prototype      version of this system was implemented. This article outlines the      close-to-reality evaluation of our prototype in a 1-week simulation study in a      Heidelberg University hospital. We describe methods, aims, design and results of       the simulation study, as well as discuss our methodology and the results we have       obtained. We argue that the diverse requirements of different professional groups      cannot be fulfilled by a single multifunctional device and propose, therefore, a       'multi-device mobile computer architecture'. Finally, we present consequences for     the future computing infrastructure.

PMID- 10708252   - OBJECTIVE: to determine whether computerized reminders during the process of      prescribing can improve the use of drugs requiring prior laboratory testing      according to the indications listed in the Drug Package Insert. MEASURES: Change       in proportion of appropriate prescribing and frequency of severe hepatotoxicity      between pre- and post-intervention. METHODS: etretinate, a medication indicated      for psoriasis, was selected as a monitored drug because it was the most      prescribed of all the identified drugs that require specific prior laboratory      tests. Computerized reminders are designed to alert a physician who is about to      prescribe etretinate either without the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test or     the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) test within 3 months or despite abnormality       in ALT or AST. Data on alerts were gathered by using electronic mail whenever     alerts occurred. RESULTS: prescriptions of etretinate with normal ALT or AST      results within the previous three months increased suddenly from 25.9% (127/491)       in the pre-intervention period to 66.2% (353/533) in the post-intervention period      (P < 0.0001). Moreover, three patients who used etretinate had markedly abnormal       tests in the pre-intervention period, but none of the patients were classified in      this way in the post-intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: the computerized reminders      appear to improve physicians' use of a drug requiring specific prior laboratory      tests.

PMID- 10708251   - Computerized medical decision support systems have been a major research topic in      recent years. Intelligent computer programs were implemented to aid physicians      and other medical professionals in making difficult medical decisions. This      report compares three different mathematical models for building a traumatic      brain injury (TBI) medical decision support system (MDSS). These models were      developed based on a large TBI patient database. This MDSS accepts a set of      patient data such as the types of skull fracture, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS),      episode of convulsion and return the chance that a neurosurgeon would recommend      an open-skull surgery for this patient. The three mathematical models described      in this report including a logistic regression model, a multi-layer perceptron      (MLP) neural network and a radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network. From the      12,640 patients selected from the database. A randomly drawn 9480 cases were used      as the training group to develop/train our models. The other 3160 cases were in      the validation group which we used to evaluate the performance of these models.      We used sensitivity, specificity, areas under receiver-operating characteristics       (ROC) curve and calibration curves as the indicator of how accurate these models       are in predicting a neurosurgeon's decision on open-skull surgery. The results      showed that, assuming equal importance of sensitivity and specificity, the      logistic regression model had a (sensitivity, specificity) of (73%, 68%),      compared to (80%, 80%) from the RBF model and (88%, 80%) from the MLP model. The       resultant areas under ROC curve for logistic regression, RBF and MLP neural      networks are 0.761, 0.880 and 0.897, respectively (P < 0.05). Among these models,      the logistic regression has noticeably poorer calibration. This study      demonstrated the feasibility of applying neural networks as the mechanism for TBI      decision support systems based on clinical databases. The results also suggest      that neural networks may be a better solution for complex, non-linear medical      decision support systems than conventional statistical techniques such as      logistic regression.
